4,The Most Popular Youtube Channels in Colombia,https://abcnews.com.co/most-popular-youtube-channels-colombia/,"If you’re like me, you’re probably always looking for new stats and new things to learn, and today when I woke up, I wanted to find out what is the most subscribed Youtube channel in Colombia?
After about 2 hours of research and I found the answer to this question.
In my blog post below, I will personally share with you what is the most popular Youtube channel in Colombia:
Recently, Daniela Calle and María José Garzón have reached a major milestone for Colombian YouTubers; they are the first Colombian YouTubers to have 10 million subscribers on their joint YouTube channel,Calle y Poché. Their channel is extremely popular in Colombia, as well as throughout Latin America, and they have amassed an impressive following by creating entertaining and informative content such as bi-weekly vlogs, tutorials, challenges, and more.
They are proof that with dedication and effort, anyone can make it big on YouTube. Not only are they inspiring other Colombians to pursue their creative passions, but their success has also opened up the market for other influencers from Colombia.
I wonder if I could make it big on Youtube in Colombia if I put as much dedication and effort as these guys did? What do you think? Let me know your opinion in the comments below.
The Truth Commission of Colombia has also been using social media to spread their message of truth and reconciliation. They have a Facebook page that has been liked by more than 250,000 people and a Twitter profile with over thirteen thousand followers. Additionally, the Commission has a YouTube channel which hosts videos about their activities, events, and projects.
Through this channel, they have reached a wide audience and have been able to share more information about the issues related to the Colombian conflict. They have also collaborated with other organizations such as edding Argentina S.A., edding Colombia S.A. and edding Mexico S. de RL de CV in order to create more engaging content for their viewers. By utilizing social media platforms such as YouTube, they are able to reach a larger audience and spread their message of truth and reconciliation throughout the world.
I first learned about the truth commission when I moved to Medellin a few years ago. In my opinion, it’s a pretty convertial topic that should be only spoken of in private while you are with your friends. I suggest that you don’t talk about this in public like on the train or bus, as you could make some locals angry.
Besides the growing success of individual Colombian YouTubers, there are also several television channels in Colombia that have been taking advantage of YouTube’s vast platform. La Pulla, Cristovision, Sonríe TV, and Nosotros TV are the most-watched broadcasting channels in Colombia. Caracol and RCN are major broadcasting networks that have also been established on YouTube.
These channels offer a wide range of programming, from news and entertainment to movies and sports. For instance, Colombia’s two-time Olympic champion Mariana Pajon headlines her home event streamed live by Olympic Channel on Olympics.com and YouTube. With the rise of Colombian influencers, these television channels have seen a surge in viewership and popularity.
My personal favorite channels are the ones talking about fitness, nutrition, psychology and health. If you would like me to share my private Youtube playlist with you, please let me know in the comments section of this article and I will personally message you within 4 hours, I promise!
As YouTube, Instagram and Facebook have become increasingly popular in Colombia, content creators have been able to reach wider audiences with their content. Research has shown that influencers use crutches, idioms, and set phrases to identify with their audience. Additionally, Google Data indicates that YouTube recorded 30.4 million users in Colombia in 2022, indicating a large potential for advertising within the platform.
This has had a major impact on the Colombian media landscape as well as on the digital divide between different social groups in the country. Furthermore, Colombian authorities have also taken to using social networks such as Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Linkedin to share information. Therefore, it is clear that social media has had a profound effect on Colombian content creators and audiences alike.
I love the Colombian landscape by the way! That’s one of the main reasons why I moved to Medellin in the first place.
The rise of Colombian influencers and famous Colombian Youtubers has been nothing short of remarkable. From bloggers, to YouTubers, to Instagrammers, Twitter and Facebook influencers, the Colombian market has been booming with creative and innovative content. As more and more people turn to online platforms for entertainment, Colombian influencers have become an important part of the digital landscape.
It doesn’t matter how many subscribers they get, as some of them have small channels that give full access to tons of free useful information about fitness, health, nutrition and more. Personally, that is the main reason why I use Youtube daily: to learn more about these topics, which are my 3 favorite topics.
Not only do they provide entertainment, but they also offer valuable insight into the culture and trends of Colombia. Through their channels, they have been able to reach millions of viewers and have become some of the most popular and influential personalities in the country. This surge in popularity has led to a new wave of influencer marketing campaigns that businesses can use to reach a larger audience. With their help, brands can create campaigns that will resonate with the Colombian public, helping them build relationships and grow their business.
When it comes to marketing to the Colombian audience, it is important to understand the culture and the unique needs of each market segment. It is also essential to have an understanding of the platforms they use and the type of content they prefer. By leveraging data and insights from dunnhumby, the MVIS® Colombia Index (MVCOLX), and other sources, marketers can better understand the Colombian audience and create tailored strategies that will reach them in a meaningful and impactful way.
I am a market myself and I want to use all the data I found during my research to increase my sales for my personal business in Medellin. I am not a Colombian Youtuber, but I plan to hire a young journalist to create videos for me and share the profits of our Youtube channels. I’ll keep you updated once we get more video views on our account before January! Until then, you can find more info on our website showcasing the top Youtubers and an integration to your Youtube analytics via the Internet using new AI technology to get most subscribers to learn about you and your business.
By using social media platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram, marketers can build relationships with influencers and create content that resonates with their target audience. By utilizing these different tactics, marketers can reach their desired Colombian audiences in an effective manner.",0

9,The Most famous Facebook pages in Colombia,https://abcnews.com.co/most-famous-facebook-pages-colombia/,"Ah, good old Facebook!
I remember when I first learned about it back in 2004, and we were throwing “digital hot potatoes” at each other, my friends and I.
I can’t believe Facebook is still going strong!
Facebook is the most used social media platform in Colombia, and there are many popular Fcebook pages that you can visit to contact your favorite Colombian businesses.
Here’s a list of them below.
As a Colombian living in the 21st century, it is no surprise to hear that Facebook is the most popular social media platform in Colombia. According to Meta data, the social network has 35.15 million users, making it the top social media website in the country. Not only is Facebook the most widely used site, but it is also the most popular – 92% of Colombians said they visited Facebook last month, and 89% reported having used WhatsApp.
It is estimated that Colombians spend an average of 3 hours and 45 minutes on social media platforms. This proves that Facebook is an integral part of life for Colombians and that it is here to stay.
The popularity of Facebook in Colombia is driven by the need for family connections. Family groups are quite popular on the platform, with many users joining to stay in touch with their loved ones. Many families set up their own private chat groups on Facebook, allowing them to keep in contact with each other without having to go through the hassle of organizing a physical gathering.
Many Colombians also use Facebook to organize events and activities for their families, such as birthdays and anniversaries. This makes it easy for families to stay connected and celebrate special occasions together, even if they live far apart. Many parents use Facebook to help keep track of their children and ensure they are safe.
I. ama father myself, so I like to keep track of my daughter’s account to make sure she doesn’t speak to weird people too much on FB. There. aremany parental apps that can help you do that, if you want me to create a blog post listing those apps, please let me know in the comments below.
It is evident that Colombians love to stay connected on social media. As of February 2022, 57.2% of social media users in Colombia were women, less than 43% were men, and 33.1% of this group were aged 18-24 years old. Moreover, Filipinos spend an average of 4 hours and 15 minutes every day on social media, making them the worldwide leader in daily usage, followed by Colombia. This means that Colombians are spending a significant amount of time engaging with their favorite social media platforms and connecting with their peers online.
I stayed din Medellin for a few months last year and can confirm that many people use Family group accounts on Facebook to keep in touch with their relatives. I personally use Facebook messenger for that, but that’s just a matter a of personal preference, in my opinion.
When it comes to social media in Colombia, Facebook and WhatsApp top the list with over 90% of users having accounts. But what other popular platforms are available here? Well, YouTube is the most used social network in Colombia with 98 percent of active users accessing the platform. Instagram follows close behind with 77 percent of users regularly using it.
While Elempleo.com, Linkedin, Career Development Center (CTP) and Glassdoor are the most commonly used job boards both by companies and job seekers. With such a wide variety of popular platforms available in Colombia, it’s no wonder that social media use is so widespread here.
I also learned recently that TikTok is becoming very popular among young Colombian teens, so if you have. business that sells products to this demographic, you should listen to my advice and and use Facebook ads and Tiktok ads to promote your company.
As of February 2022, there are an estimated 35.15 million Facebook users in Colombia. The country has the lowest fixed broadband penetration among OECD countries, however, it still ranks first in Latin America when it comes to Facebook usage.
This is likely due to the fact that 92% of Colombians reported visiting Facebook last month and 89% reported using WhatsApp. These two social media outlets are hugely popular throughout the country, with 90% of internet users having an account on either or both.
Most social media users in Colombia are between 18-34 years of age and are active on platforms such as YouTube and Facebook. According to Meta’s advertising resources, women make up 57.2% of the Colombian Facebook user base, and 33.1% of this group are aged between 35-44 years old. Lastly, the typical user has ‘liked’ a median number of 8 pages on Facebook.
I learned that there are millions of Facebook users in Colombia from a documentary about FB that I watched on television last month.
Facebook is extremely popular in Colombia, with over 41 million users as of June 2022. This makes it the 8th largest user of Facebook in the world, and the largest user in Latin America. The popularity of Facebook in this country is due to a number of factors, including the fact that it’s easy to use and widely available.
Its integration with other social media platforms such as WhatsApp means that it’s often used as a platform for communication by many Colombians. As well as this, family and friends often use Facebook to stay in touch and share updates. With such a large user base, Colombia is an important market for businesses looking to advertise on the platform.
In my opinion, which is also backed u by real stats, the United States will always remain the country with the most active Facebook users, especially now that FB changes its name to Meta and they are investing heavily in VR tech for the future. I can’t wait to see what happens in a few years, it’s exciting!
Yes, Colombia does have Facebook and it is the fourth most popular social media platform in the country. According to Meta data, there are 35.15 million Facebook users in Colombia, which makes it the second largest user of Facebook in Latin America. In the 2016 plebiscite, Facebook reached an audience of 32 million Colombians on the Internet.
Whatsapp is ranked number 1 and is the most visited Social Media Networks website in Colombia in December 2022, followed by facebook.com as the runner up.
Oscar Fonseca, a professor in the Department of Communication and Information Technologies at the University of Antioquia, analyzed 100 Facebook profiles from Colombia and conducted 20 interviews. The graph shows that Android has 54.95%, Windows has 19.59% and IOS has 25.45% usage for social media in Colombia from Dec 2021 to Dec 2022. It is clear that Colombian people love their social media and have embraced it with open arms.
When meeting new people in Medellin, I found that whatsapp was the easiest way for me to exchange contact information, especially when I use the QR code scan function.
If you’re looking for the Latin American country with the most Facebook users, then look no further than Colombia. With 35.15 million users, Colombia is the second most popular country in terms of social media usage, behind only Guatemala.
Facebook and WhatsApp are by far the most popular social networks in Colombia, with over 90% of internet users having an account on either platform.

I personally prefer to use the Art boards compared to the Bulletin boards, but that’s just my personal preference and you are free do take it or leave it in my opinion.
As a student, I love the idea of having a Colombia bulletin board in our classroom to celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month. After School, Bulletin Board, Lp, September, Frame are all great ideas for decorating and making our classroom more festive. We can use these items to create an eye-catching bulletin board that showcases all the different aspects of Hispanic culture and heritage. This will be something that we can look back on and remember for many years to come.

After digging around, I found a board called “Colombia Who Is My Neighbor, Bubba Keg, Oracion A San Antonio” created by Prendese Bareto. This board is packed with amazing visuals of Colombia’s culture, from Catholic funeral homes in San Diego to May Festival 2013 San Antonio TX! I love this board because it’s a great source for discovering the country’s hidden treasures and attractions.
I also appreciate the variety of topics covered in this board, from Taganga full colombian movie to Queen Bee Taj Mahal Live. This board is a great source of inspiration for anyone looking to learn more about Colombia’s culture and history.
I found that the best thing about this board is the fact that it showcases pins from many different industries at once. that saves me time instead of having to browse through tons of different boards. I just glance at this board quickly while having my breakfast in the morning.

I used to be an artist when I was younger, so this board reminds me of a lot of shows that we created and performed in the past and all the good times that I had in the process.
If you’re a content marketer looking for ideas, Pinterest is a great resource before you buy Pinterest ads for your Pinterest account on this social media platform or for your Pinterest profile or multiple accounts. From blog posts to social media posts and videos, there are hundreds of ideas to help you create valuable content for your customers. To get the most out of Pinterest, start by optimizing your pins and creating targeted ads.
I personally like to reach my target audience by creating blog posts showcasing stats for marketers in Columbia, just like the article that you are reading right now. I found that these articles attract a lot of free links from other blogs and it helps increase how many people see my blog posts and access my website or site at this link shown on the pictures.

As Pinterest grows in popularity, it is no surprise that the platform is seeing a major surge in users from Colombia. In the past year, the number of users from Colombia has been steadily increasing and is projected to reach 3 million by the end of 2022.
When it comes to popular searches on Pinterest, 97% of them are unbranded and consist of 2-3 word queries. This shows that the majority of consumers are looking for inspiration and ideas rather than specific products or services. In Colombia, the top trending searches on Pinterest include “christmas nails”, “popular categories”, “recipes”, “home ideas”, “style inspiration”, and “travel boards”. Moreover, a popular search within the last 30 days is Coffee Capsule Master Origin Colombia. With so many options available on Pinterest, it is no wonder why it has become one of the largest social media platforms in Colombia with an estimated 3.33 million users.
Of course, adult content will always remain the #1 search, but I noticed that the CEO of Pinterest actually blocks those searches to keep 100% of the content safe for work. Which is great in my opinion.
As one of the most renowned online communities for design products and materials, Architonic is quickly becoming a popular choice among Pinterest users. With over 8,000 followers and 617 boards, they have created a list of the 7 best Pinterest accounts to gain inspiration from various topics such as fashion, interior design, and travel. What’s more, they have acquired ArchDaily, the world’s most popular architecture project. With this acquisition, even more users are flocking to Architonic to gain insight into the world of design.

For example, Betty Bravo’s board offers stunning photos of Colombia’s incredible landscapes, Kirsten Alana provides helpful travel tips and itineraries for exploring the country, and Turismo Logo has an array of amazing souvenirs you could pick up on your visit. There’s plenty of inspiration out there to help make the most out of your trip to Colombia.

14,Left Brain Vs Right Brain,https://abcnews.com.co/left-brain-vs-right-brain/,"Have you ever heard someone describe themselves as someone who tends to think more with their right brain or their left brain? You have most likely seen the term in a variety of mediums, ranging from novels to shows shown on television. Or maybe you’ve tried your hand at finding out which personality type most accurately fits you by taking a quiz online.
You’ve undoubtedly also come across at least a few infographics on Pinterest or Facebook that make the claim that they can determine which hemisphere of your brain is dominant. And it’s possible that you’ve read a few articles or books that indicate you can tap into the latent creative potential of your right brain or the logical reasoning of your left brain.
People who are classified as having a dominant left hemisphere tend to excel in areas such as mathematics and reasoning. On the other hand, those who are regarded as having a dominant activity in their right hemisphere of their brain are informed that their abilities lie more on the artistic side of things. 1
It may come as a surprise to you to find that the concept of “right-brained” and “left-brained” thinkers is only one of the many myths that exist about the human brain, given how widespread this concept is.
© Verywell, 2017
Right-Brain Characteristics
The notion of left-brain vs right-brain dominance proposes that the right side of the brain is superior for activities that require expressiveness and creativity. Some of the skills that are often attributed to the use of one’s right hemisphere of the brain include2 the following:

So what kind of characteristics do those who are said to have a “right brain” have? They are frequently thought of as being more emotional, intuitive, and creative than other people. They are typically regarded as being successful in occupations that entail creative expression and free thought, such as becoming an artist, a psychologist, or a writer. One example of such a career is becoming a philosopher.
The left hemisphere of the brain excels in activities that require logical reasoning, language, and analytical thought. It’s been said that the left side of the brain is superior at: 1
Language\sLogic
Exercises in critical thinking
Numbers\sReasoning
What kind of interests do someone with a “left brain” have? They are thought to be rational, analytical, and orderly in their approach. Left-brain dominant individuals, according to this hypothesis, do very well in jobs that require linear thinking, mathematical reasoning, and verbal knowledge. Some examples of such jobs are computer programmer, scientist, and accountant.
Theory
According to the concept of left-brain vs right-brain dominance, the two sides of the brain are responsible for distinct modes of thought.
3
People are considered to favor one way of thinking over the other, which brings up another interesting point.
A person who is considered to have a “left-brained” personality, for instance, is often thought to be more rational, analytical, and objective. People are supposed to have greater intuition, thoughtfulness, and subjectivity if they have more “right brain” characteristics. 1
The lateralization of brain function is a notion that was developed in the field of psychology. The brain is divided into two hemispheres, and each hemisphere is responsible for a variety of functions. The corpus callosum is the pathway that allows communication between the two hemispheres of the brain. 4
The muscles on the right side of the body are controlled by the left hemisphere of the brain, whereas the muscles on the left side of the body are controlled by the right hemisphere. Because of this, for instance, injury to the left side of the brain may have an impact on the right side of the body.

Steven Gans, MD, has conducted a medical assessment of this video for your convenience.
History
Therefore, does each hemisphere of the brain regulate a different set of functions? Are persons more likely to have a left or right brain dominance? This myth, like many others that are prevalent in the field of popular psychology, originated from observations of the human brain that were later grossly misrepresented and embellished.
The work of Roger W. Sperry, who was given the Nobel Prize in 1981, is considered to be the foundation of the right brain vs left brain hypothesis.
5 He conducted research on people who had had surgery to have their corpus callosums broken in order to cure intractable epilepsy. The corpus callosum is the structure that links the two hemispheres of the brain.
However, in addition to these symptoms, these individuals also suffered others when the channel that allowed communication between the two halves of the brain was severed. For instance, many people diagnosed with split brain discovered that they were unable to identify things that were processed by the right half of their brains but were able to name things that were processed by the left side of their brains. Sperry concluded, on the basis of this knowledge, that the left hemisphere of the brain was responsible for the regulation of language. 6
The left half of the brain is often responsible for many parts of language and reasoning, whereas the right side of the brain is typically responsible for handling spatial information and the ability to comprehend images.
7
Research
Newer research has shown that the brain is not nearly as binary as was previously believed to be the case. For instance, research has revealed that one’s talents in fields such as mathematics are at their peak when both parts of the brain are working together. [Citation needed]
Neuroscientists are now aware that the two hemispheres of the brain interact with one another via a structure called the corpus callosum in order to carry out a wide range of mental operations together.
8
Carl Zimmer, a scientific journalist, presented this concept in an essay that he wrote for Discover magazine. “No matter how lateralized the brain may grow, however, the two sides still operate together,”
“The popular psychology concept of a left brain and a right brain fails to grasp the close functional interaction between the two cerebral hemispheres. The left hemisphere of the brain is responsible for tasks like as recognizing the individual sounds that comprise words and figuring out the grammar of phrases, but it does not have exclusive control over the processing of language. The right hemisphere of the brain is more emotionally sensitive than the left, and it is better at tuning in to the slow rhythms of speech that transmit intonation and emphasis.
Researchers from the University of Utah conducted a study in which over a thousand people participated and had their brains examined so that the researchers could discover whether or not the subjects used one side of their brain more often than the other.
According to the findings of the research, the amount of activity on both sides of the brain was almost same when viewed on an average basis, despite the fact that activity was sometimes greater in particular key locations.
Some brain activities can only be carried out on one side of the brain or the other, which is a fact that cannot be refuted. Language is more often found on the left, whereas attention is more often seen on the right. However, humans do not often have a left-sided or right-sided brain network that is more dominant. “It appears to be determined more connection by link,” noted Dr. Jeff Anderson, who was the primary author on the research.
Therefore, despite the fact that individuals are often labeled as having either a right-brained or left-brained orientation, the reality is that they have both. Despite the fact that the concept of right-brained vs left-brained thinking has been disproved, it continues to remain popular.
Persisting Myths
Despite the fact that several studies have shown that the right-brain/left-brain paradigm is a fallacy,9 many people still believe in it. Why? Regrettably, a great many of individuals probably aren’t aware that the hypothesis has been superseded. In point of fact, it seems that the concept has developed a personality of its own inside popular culture.
There is no shortage of information out there that will lead you to believe that you can unlock the full potential of your mind if you simply determine which side of your brain is more powerful or predominates over the other. This information can be found anywhere, from magazine articles to books to online quizzes.
Today’s students may continue to study about the theory as a topic of historical interest. This would allow them to grasp how our notions about how the brain works have grown and altered over time as researchers have discovered more about how the brain functions.
Understanding where your strengths and limitations lie might assist you in developing more effective methods of learning and studying, despite the fact that popular psychology and self-help publications tend to overgeneralize and exaggerate the importance of these concepts. Students who, for instance, have trouble following verbal instructions, which is often considered to be a trait associated with the right hemisphere of the brain, may gain an advantage by writing down instructions and improving their organizing abilities.
If you take one of the many left brain/right brain tests that you will most likely come across online, the most important thing for you to keep in mind is that the quizzes are just for entertainment purposes, and you shouldn’t put too much faith in the results.
A Look at the Brain in 8 Facts
How to Keep Your Brain in Good Physical Condition
There are activities that you may engage in to maintain the sharpness of your intellect as well as the health of your brain, regardless of whether you consider yourself to be more of an analytical or creative type.
Exercise on a consistent basis: studies have shown that exercise has a protective impact on people’s cognition and the health of their brains as they age.
10
Keeping your mind busy has been shown to improve brain health, according to research. This is especially true for those who engage in mental activity on a regular basis and who work in intellectually taxing professions, such as academia.
11
Participate in social activities. Not only is the support of others crucial for your mental health, but it is also necessary for the health of your brain, especially as you become older.
12
Maintaining a healthy diet is important since the foods you consume may also have an effect on the health and function of your brain. Make it a priority to consume a well-rounded diet that emphasizes consumption of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates.
Sleep is critical to maintaining a healthy brain and proper mental function; thus, you should make it a priority to obtain adequate rest each night. Maintaining a consistent routine for when you sleep and when you get up might be beneficial to your overall health.
A Word From Verywell
Both sides of your brain are engaged in whatever kind of thinking you are performing, regardless of the specific sort of thinking. It’s possible that the right-brain vs left-brain idea is flawed, but it doesn’t mean it’s not important to have a good awareness of your own talents. You may also safeguard the health of your brain by engaging in regular physical activity, obtaining enough quality sleep, maintaining positive social relationships, and engaging in mental activities.

15,Human Digestive System,https://abcnews.com.co/human-digestive-system/,"Digestive system of Humans
The mouth is the beginning point of the human digestive system, which continues all the way down to the anus. It encompasses a variety of anatomical components, including the mouth, oesophagus, pancreas, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, liver, gall bladder, and anus.

The Pharynx the Esophagus the Stomach the Small Intestines the Large Intestines and the Rectum are the Accessory Organs That Make Up the Digestion Process.

Digestion\sAbsorption
Excretion\sDisorders
Functions
Notes
A collection of organs in the human body form what is known as the digestive system. This system is responsible for converting the fuel that the body gets from meals into usable energy. The digestive system is comprised anatomically of the gastrointestinal tract, as well as ancillary organs such as the gallbladder, liver, and pancreas. The mouth, the stomach, the oesophagus, the small intestine, and the large intestine, which includes the rectum and the anus, are the hollow organs that make up the digestive system, often known as the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract).
Both the human digestive system and nutrition refer to the process by which an organism takes in food and then uses that food to generate energy. This is an essential mechanism that enables living things to receive the energy they need from a variety of different places. The nutrients that are contained in the food that we consume are subjected to a significant amount of processing before they are used to produce energy. Digestion is the term used to describe this process. This process requires specific organs and systems, which are present in humans and other animals.
The alimentary canal, in addition to a number of other auxiliary organs and organ systems, are essential components of the digestive process. Due to the fact that people only have one stomach, the procedure is rather straightforward. This indicates that human stomach only has one chamber, in contrast to other animals such as cows, who have four chambers in their stomachs.
In addition, several components of the neurological and circulatory systems have an important function to play in the digestive process. The process of digestion is completed by using a variety of components, including nerves, bacteria, hormones, blood, and other organs of the digestive system.
Let’s take a close look at the digestive system of a human being, dissecting its components and analyzing their roles. In addition, information on the digestive system may be found at the conclusion of the chapter.

The following graphic illustrates the many sections of the digestive system that are responsible for the transformation of food into the vital nutrients that are then absorbed by the body.
An Illustration Of The Digestive System Of The Human Body
Components of the Digestive System of a Human Being
The human body’s digestive system is made up of a number of organs that collaborate to break down food into usable forms of energy and other fundamental nutrients in order to keep the body functioning properly. Our bodies digest and make use of the food we eat, and the bits of the food that aren’t utilised are expelled via the bowels as waste.
The term “digestive system” refers to the combination of the gastrointestinal tract (also known as the alimentary canal) and the organs that are located in close proximity to it (tongue, liver, pancreas, etc.). These two components, when combined, are beneficial to the digestive process.
The alimentary canal is a lengthy tube that the food that we consume travels through on its way out of the body. It starts in the mouth (also known as the buccal or oral cavity), then travels via the throat, the oesophagus or food pipe, the stomach, the small intestines, the large intestines, and the rectum before arriving at the anus. As the food particles go through the different compartments of the alimentary canal, they undergo slow digestion as the process begins.
Accessory organs are organs that are involved in the digestive process but are not technically a part of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). They accomplish this by causing the release of certain enzymes, which aid in the digestive process by breaking down the meal.
Let’s take a more in-depth look at the digestive system of the human body, including its components and the activities they perform:
Food begins its trip through the body in the mouth, often known as the oral cavity. There are a number of additional organs than the tongue, salivary glands, and teeth that are involved in the digesting process. The purpose of teeth is to ground food into smaller bits, and saliva is used to keep them wet while they do so. The tongue is then responsible for pushing the food down into the pharynx.
Pharynx
A fibrous and muscular tube in the form of a y that is linked to the very tip of the mouth. Its primary function is to assist in the movement of food that has been chewed or crushed from the mouth to the oesophagus. Because air must pass through the pharynx on its journey to the lungs after entering the nasal cavity, it plays an important role in the body’s respiratory system as well.
Oesophagus
This is a muscular tube that joins the pharynx, which is a portion of an upper segment of the gastrointestinal system, to the larynx, which is also a component of the larynx. Along with its length, it provides the food that is ingested.
You may also like: Food Pipe
Stomach
It performs the function of a muscle bag and is located on the left side of the abdominal cavity, just under the diaphragm. This essential organ not only works as a storage space for the food, but it also buys the body some much-needed time to digest the food. The stomach is responsible for the production of digestive enzymes as well as hydrochloric acid, both of which are essential to the digesting process.
Mucus is a thin, watery substance that is generated by the mucous membranes of the body. It does this by shielding the lining of the stomach and the gastric pits from the acid that is produced by the glands in order to kill the bacteria that arrived in the digestive tract along with the food particles.
The digestive enzymes are a collection of enzymes that perform their activity by cleaving polymeric macromolecules, such as biopolymers, into the smaller and more straightforward components they consist of.
It is the digestive fluid that is produced by the stomach during the process of digestion and is known as hydrochloric acid. It does this by eliminating potentially dangerous microbes that are found in the food particles.
Small Intestine
The small intestine is a segment of the lower gastrointestinal system that consists of a thin, long tube that may be up to 10 feet in length. It is located just behind the stomach and takes up the majority of the space inside the abdominal cavity. The whole of the small intestine is coiled, and its inner surface is ridged and folded in several places.
Large Intestine
This is a lengthy tube that is rather thick and is maybe about 5 feet in length. It is situated directly below the stomach and wraps around the upper and side margins of the small intestine. It takes in water and is made up of bacteria that live in harmony with one another to promote the decomposition of waste products and the collection of trace nutrients.
Rectum
Stool is the name given to the solid waste that is expelled from the body after being processed via the rectum at the end of the large intestine, where waste materials are excreted. It is kept as semi-solid feces in the rectum, which are subsequently expelled from the body via the anal canal during the act of defecation.
Pancreas One of the Accessory Organs
It is a sizable gland that may be seen just beneath the stomach. It has a short length, with its front end being attached to the duodenum and its back end pointing towards the left side of the abdominal cavity. The process of chemical digestion is finished when the pancreas releases digestive enzymes into the bloodstream.
Read more about the pancreas here.
Liver
The liver is an auxiliary organ of the digestive system that is about triangular in shape and has a rusty brown color. It is placed to the right of the stomach. It is responsible for producing bile, which is then secreted into the small intestine, where it assists in the breakdown of fat. The gallbladder is responsible for the storage and recycling of bile. It is a very little organ that is shaped like a pear and may be found right next to the liver.
Cellulose in digestion is another interesting read.
The Process of Digestion
The mouth is where digestion begins, and the small intestine is where it concludes; the large intestines are primarily responsible for absorbing any remaining water from undigested food and facilitating bacterial fermentation of materials that can no longer be digested. Digestion begins in the mouth and concludes in the small intestine.
The alimentary canal, also known as the gastrointestinal tract, is a network of hollow organs and tubes that extends from the mouth cavity all the way down through the pharynx, the stomach, the small intestines, the large intestines, and finally the anus. This network of organs and tubes is called the gastrointestinal tract. As they go through the different compartments of the gastrointestinal system, food particles undergo digestion at a more or less slow pace.
The following processes make up the digestive process that takes place in the body.
Ingestion
Mastication is the very first step that must be taken (chewing). Before the food is sent farther down into the food pipe, the salivary glands and the tongue work together to assist the food become more lubricated and wet.
Mixing and shifting around
It entails lubricating and otherwise altering food before sending it down the food pipe, via the food pipe (using peristalsis), and into the stomach.
Secretion
The digestive process is assisted by enzymes and acids that are secreted by organs such as the stomach, small intestine, liver, and pancreas. In order to perform its job, it separates the constituent parts of food into their most basic and readily absorbable forms.
Additionally Read: What Is the Liver?

The process of reducing complex food particles into simpler molecules in the presence of enzymes and acids that are released by various digestive organs during digestion.
Learn more about digestive fluids by reading on.
Absorption
This process gets under way in the small intestine, which is also where the majority of the minerals and nutrients are absorbed. The large intestines are responsible for the absorption of any surplus water that may be present in the stuff that cannot be digested.
Excretion
The process of eliminating waste products and chemicals that cannot be digested from the body via the act of feces.
The digestive process may be broken down into six distinct stages, which are as follows in a nutshell:
Consumption “Mixing and Moving” [Ingestion] The secretion of Absorption, then Excretion, then Digestion

The complaint was brought by Fox News against the fact-checking website Snopes in response to an article that referred to the network as “fake news.”
In the case, which was submitted to a federal court in Tennessee, it is said that Snopes “smeared” Fox News by referring to the network as a “fake news” outlet. Fox News alleges in its lawsuit that the report was published by Snopes with “reckless contempt for the truth,” and that the publication of the story has resulted in severe harm to the reputation of the network.
The article in question was written in 2017 and given the title “The Greatest ‘Fake News’ List.” In the article, Snopes included a number of items that it said were “fake news,” including many that had been published by Fox News. Among the stories featured were several that Snopes claimed had been published by Fox News. The article did not directly refer to Fox News as a “fake news” source; nonetheless, the network contends that the inclusion of its items on the list gave the impression that Fox News was one.
In response to the legal action taken against it, Snopes has said that the website stands by its reporting and that it considers the legal action to be without foundation. The website that checks the veracity of information has issued a statement in which it asserts that it has “always worked carefully to retain its reputation as a trustworthy source of information” and that it would “vigorously defend itself against this false action.”
The case might have enormous repercussions for the media as well as journalism, especially in light of the present political atmosphere. The usage of the phrase “fake news” has become highly political, with some people using it as a method to discount any news that is critical of their ideas or beliefs and others using it as a way to discredit any news that is critical of their views. A worrying new trend is the fact that a major news network is now suing a fact-checking website over the usage of the phrase.
The lawsuit also sheds light on the difficulties that fact-checking groups face in an environment that is becoming more divided and political across all forms of media. Fact-checking groups are facing an uphill struggle in their attempts to counteract misinformation and deception as the media is becoming more fragmented and sources of information are becoming more walled.
In the end, the case brings up crucial concerns regarding the function of the media in democratic societies, as well as the difficulties faced by fact-checking groups and their capacity to function in an atmosphere in which the truth is increasingly under assault. The outcome of the case is yet to be determined, but one thing is now abundantly clear: the conflict over so-called “fake news” is far from ended.

18,Bill Murray Kicks Off Presidential Campaign South Carolina,https://abcnews.com.co/bill-murray-kicks-off-presidential-campaign-south-carolina/,"The well-known comedian and actor Bill Murray has declared his intention to run for president of the United States, and he will launch his campaign in the state of South Carolina, where he was born and raised. Murray, who has been a cherished character in American popular culture for a very long time, startled many people when he announced his intention to run for public office.
Background information about Murray and his platform
Murray has established a platform that contains a variety of progressive objectives, despite the fact that he has no previous experience in politics. These programs include more financing for public education, improved access to healthcare, and initiatives to address climate change. In addition to this, he has been an outspoken supporter of reforming the criminal justice system. Specifically, he has demanded an end to the practice of mass imprisonment as well as the elimination of the death sentence.
Response to Murray’s Run for the Office
The public and the media have provided a range of responses to the revelation that Murray would be running for office. Others have derided the actor’s effort as nothing more than a publicity ploy, despite the fact that he has been hailed for his dedication to social justice and his readiness to speak out on crucial causes. Yet, Murray’s campaign has received a great amount of attention, and many people are interested to see how voters will respond to the message he is delivering.
Plan of Attack for Murray’s Campaign
Murray has chosen to run his campaign utilizing a grassroots approach, with a primary emphasis on developing personal relationships with people. He has made it a point to go to a variety of cities and towns around South Carolina, where he has engaged in conversation with locals and listened to their problems. In addition to this, he has made an effort to connect with younger voters by campaigning on college campuses and at other events geared at young people. In addition to this, Murray has used social media in order to reach a larger audience. For example, he has shared his views and opinions with the people who follow him on Twitter and Instagram.
The Direction That Murray’s Campaign Will Take
It is not yet clear if Murray’s presidential bid will gather pace and develop into a credible challenger to the current front-runner in the race for the White House. He does not have any prior experience in politics, which is one of the key hurdles he has, along with the need to build a strong and devoted following of followers. Nonetheless, people who are searching for something new in their political leaders may find that Murray’s unusual style and captivating personality appeal him to them.
Conclusion
Already, there is a great amount of talk and interest about Bill Murray’s presidential candidacy, not just in South Carolina but also across the rest of the nation. While it is quite doubtful that his candidacy would completely transform the political landscape, it does mark a period in American politics that is both unique and fascinating. Whether or not Murray is ultimately successful in his bid for the presidency, he has already made an impact, sparking new conversations and debates about the role of celebrities in American politics and the importance of grassroots organizing in modern campaigns. This is the case regardless of whether or not Murray wins the Democratic nomination for the presidency.

21,Obama Signs Executive Order Banning National Anthem,https://abcnews.com.co/obama-signs-executive-order-banning-national-anthem/,"The President has signed an executive order that will prohibit the playing of the national anthem.
A little-known government official named Barack Obama just issued an executive order that prohibits the playing of the national anthem in public settings. This action has sparked widespread debate and indignation throughout the country. The decision, which went into force right away, has caused a lot of people in the United States to doubt both the intentions and the authority of President Obama and his administration.
For a very long time, the national anthem has served as a symbol of both national unity and identity. It also serves as a representation of the ideas and values that are very important to the American people. It has been performed at sports events, political rallies, and other public meetings for decades, bringing people from all walks of life together in a common display of patriotism and pride in their country. Many people are concerned that the removal of the national anthem from public spaces would result in the eradication of a symbol that brings people together and will do irreparable harm to the social fabric of the United States.
The presidential order itself has a very wide scope, since it applies to any and all public meetings and events, as well as any and all renditions or broadcasts of the national anthem. The decision cites a variety of grounds for the prohibition, including worries about the contentious and controversial character of the song’s lyrics, as well as the possibility that extremist organizations may co-opt the anthem and utilize it for political purposes.
The ban’s detractors have been eager to point out the possible legal challenges and political ramifications that may occur as a consequence of the ban. There have been claims made that the executive order is a blatant breach of both the right to free expression and the First Amendment, and that it is very unlikely to hold up under examination from the courts. Others have voiced their fear that the ban would not promote peace and understanding but rather will further inflame emotions and exacerbate divides within the nation.
In spite of the backlash, President Obama has not wavered in his support for the travel restriction, maintaining that it is essential to safeguard the moral character and fundamental principles of the nation. In addition to this, he has exhorted his fellow citizens to exercise patience and understanding, as well as to collaborate with one another in order to devise new strategies for demonstrating their patriotism and love for their nation.
It is still unclear what the long-term effects of the ban will be, but one thing is very clear: the controversy about the playing of the national anthem is far from done. A lightning rod for heated conversation and argument, both online and offline, the ban will serve as while Americans continue to struggle with the issue of what it means to be patriotic and unified, the ban will serve as a lightning rod for intense discussion and debate.
To summarize, President Obama’s decision to prohibit the playing of the national anthem at public events has prompted significant debate regarding the function of patriotism and national identity in the United States. As citizens, it is our duty to participate in discussions and debates, to openly express our thoughts, beliefs, and points of view, and to collaborate with one another in order to make our nation even more powerful and unified. In spite of the fact that the decision to forbid the playing of the national anthem has stoked controversy and division among us, it also provides us with a chance to join together and brainstorm innovative ways of expressing our affection for the nation that we are proud to call home.

23,NC Governor Hb2 Hotline Report Correct Bathroom,https://abcnews.com.co/nc-governor-hb2-hotline-report-correct-bathroom/,"In 2016, the state of North Carolina approved House Bill 2, often known as HB2, which was a bill that barred local governments from implementing anti-discrimination measures and limited transgender people’s access to restrooms based on their gender identity. The bill has been met with significant opposition, including calls for boycotts and legal challenges. The ACLU of North Carolina initiated the Correct Bathroom campaign as a response to the discriminatory effects of House Bill 2, with the goal of collecting the personal narratives of people who have been subjected to discrimination as a result of the law. A report on the hotline that was just just published by the campaign sheds light on the damage that was caused by HB2 as well as the necessity for inclusive bathroom rules.
The history of House Bill 2
Individuals were forced to use public toilets and changing facilities that correspond to their biological sex assigned at birth in accordance with HB2, often known as the “bathroom bill.” This law did not take into account people’ gender identities. Also, the bill made it illegal for municipal governments to provide laws against discrimination for anyone who identify as LGBTQ+. The bill was met with opposition from civil rights organizations, companies, and artists, who boycotted performances and events scheduled to take place in the state. The legislation was finally overturned in 2017 after being subjected to a number of legal challenges, some of which resulted in the courts knocking down elements of the statute.
The Fight for the Appropriate Restroom
The ACLU of North Carolina has launched a campaign called “Correct Bathroom” with the goal of collecting the personal accounts of people who have been subjected to discrimination as a result of House Bill 2 (HB2). The goal of the campaign was to increase awareness of the effects of the law and to promote the need for inclusive restroom policies that respect the gender identity of individuals. In the report that was distributed in January 2022 about the hotline, there are accounts from people who have endured harassment, intimidation, and even physical assault as a result of the legislation.
The experiences of people like Devin, a transgender man who was harassed and verbally abused by strangers after being denied access to the men’s restroom, are detailed in the report. Devin is one of the individuals profiled in the report. The account of Zee, a non-binary person who was forced out of a women’s toilet after being refused entrance to a gender-neutral facility, is also included in the study. Zee was taken from the women’s restroom by security officers. These stories shed light on the damage done by HB2 and the critical need for inclusive policy regarding public restrooms.
Reactions to the Information Provided by the Hotline
The Proper Restroom campaign as well as the hotline report have gained support from advocacy organizations as well as senators who have been campaigning for the repeal of HB2. Also, the research has garnered interest from the media, receiving coverage in both regional and national news publications. The findings and the personal accounts of those who have been subjected to discrimination have brought to light the critical need for inclusive bathroom regulations that pay respect to the gender identity of individuals and protect them from being harassed or assaulted.
Conclusion
Both the Correct Bathroom campaign and the hotline report have helped to shed light on the damage that was caused by HB2 as well as the necessity of inclusive policies and protections for transgender individuals. The research and the personal accounts of those who have been subjected to prejudice serve as a potent reminder of the damaging effects of discriminatory legislation and the critical nature of working for the rights of LGBTQ+ persons. It is very necessary to show support for the Proper Bathroom campaign and to advocate for policies and regulations that encourage inclusiveness and respect for all people. We must keep working for a future in which everyone, regardless of their gender identity, is afforded the respect of being able to use the toilet in a safe and dignified manner.

28,The Most Popular Youtube Channels in Colombia,https://abcnews.com.co/most-popular-youtube-channels-colombia/,"If you’re like me, you’re probably always looking for new stats and new things to learn, and today when I woke up, I wanted to find out what is the most subscribed Youtube channel in Colombia?
After about 2 hours of research and I found the answer to this question.
In my blog post below, I will personally share with you what is the most popular Youtube channel in Colombia:
Recently, Daniela Calle and María José Garzón have reached a major milestone for Colombian YouTubers; they are the first Colombian YouTubers to have 10 million subscribers on their joint YouTube channel,Calle y Poché. Their channel is extremely popular in Colombia, as well as throughout Latin America, and they have amassed an impressive following by creating entertaining and informative content such as bi-weekly vlogs, tutorials, challenges, and more.
They are proof that with dedication and effort, anyone can make it big on YouTube. Not only are they inspiring other Colombians to pursue their creative passions, but their success has also opened up the market for other influencers from Colombia.
I wonder if I could make it big on Youtube in Colombia if I put as much dedication and effort as these guys did? What do you think? Let me know your opinion in the comments below.
The Truth Commission of Colombia has also been using social media to spread their message of truth and reconciliation. They have a Facebook page that has been liked by more than 250,000 people and a Twitter profile with over thirteen thousand followers. Additionally, the Commission has a YouTube channel which hosts videos about their activities, events, and projects.
Through this channel, they have reached a wide audience and have been able to share more information about the issues related to the Colombian conflict. They have also collaborated with other organizations such as edding Argentina S.A., edding Colombia S.A. and edding Mexico S. de RL de CV in order to create more engaging content for their viewers. By utilizing social media platforms such as YouTube, they are able to reach a larger audience and spread their message of truth and reconciliation throughout the world.
I first learned about the truth commission when I moved to Medellin a few years ago. In my opinion, it’s a pretty convertial topic that should be only spoken of in private while you are with your friends. I suggest that you don’t talk about this in public like on the train or bus, as you could make some locals angry.
Besides the growing success of individual Colombian YouTubers, there are also several television channels in Colombia that have been taking advantage of YouTube’s vast platform. La Pulla, Cristovision, Sonríe TV, and Nosotros TV are the most-watched broadcasting channels in Colombia. Caracol and RCN are major broadcasting networks that have also been established on YouTube.
These channels offer a wide range of programming, from news and entertainment to movies and sports. For instance, Colombia’s two-time Olympic champion Mariana Pajon headlines her home event streamed live by Olympic Channel on Olympics.com and YouTube. With the rise of Colombian influencers, these television channels have seen a surge in viewership and popularity.
My personal favorite channels are the ones talking about fitness, nutrition, psychology and health. If you would like me to share my private Youtube playlist with you, please let me know in the comments section of this article and I will personally message you within 4 hours, I promise!
As YouTube, Instagram and Facebook have become increasingly popular in Colombia, content creators have been able to reach wider audiences with their content. Research has shown that influencers use crutches, idioms, and set phrases to identify with their audience. Additionally, Google Data indicates that YouTube recorded 30.4 million users in Colombia in 2022, indicating a large potential for advertising within the platform.
This has had a major impact on the Colombian media landscape as well as on the digital divide between different social groups in the country. Furthermore, Colombian authorities have also taken to using social networks such as Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Linkedin to share information. Therefore, it is clear that social media has had a profound effect on Colombian content creators and audiences alike.
I love the Colombian landscape by the way! That’s one of the main reasons why I moved to Medellin in the first place.
The rise of Colombian influencers and famous Colombian Youtubers has been nothing short of remarkable. From bloggers, to YouTubers, to Instagrammers, Twitter and Facebook influencers, the Colombian market has been booming with creative and innovative content.

It doesn’t matter how many subscribers they get, as some of them have small channels that give full access to tons of free useful information about fitness, health, nutrition and more. Personally, that is the main reason why I use Youtube daily: to learn more about these topics, which are my 3 favorite topics.
Not only do they provide entertainment, but they also offer valuable insight into the culture and trends of Colombia. Through their channels, they have been able to reach millions of viewers and have become some of the most popular and influential personalities in the country. This surge in popularity has led to a new wave of influencer marketing campaigns that businesses can use to reach a larger audience. With their help, brands can create campaigns that will resonate with the Colombian public, helping them build relationships and grow their business.
When it comes to marketing to the Colombian audience, it is important to understand the culture and the unique needs of each market segment. It is also essential to have an understanding of the platforms they use and the type of content they prefer. By leveraging data and insights from dunnhumby, the MVIS® Colombia Index (MVCOLX), and other sources, marketers can better understand the Colombian audience and create tailored strategies that will reach them in a meaningful and impactful way.
I am a market myself and I want to use all the data I found during my research to increase my sales for my personal business in Medellin.

33,The Most famous Facebook pages in Colombia,https://abcnews.com.co/most-famous-facebook-pages-colombia/,"Ah, good old Facebook!
I remember when I first learned about it back in 2004, and we were throwing “digital hot potatoes” at each other, my friends and I.
I can’t believe Facebook is still going strong!
Facebook is the most used social media platform in Colombia, and there are many popular Fcebook pages that you can visit to contact your favorite Colombian businesses.
Here’s a list of them below.
As a Colombian living in the 21st century, it is no surprise to hear that Facebook is the most popular social media platform in Colombia. According to Meta data, the social network has 35.15 million users, making it the top social media website in the country. Not only is Facebook the most widely used site, but it is also the most popular – 92% of Colombians said they visited Facebook last month, and 89% reported having used WhatsApp.
It is estimated that Colombians spend an average of 3 hours and 45 minutes on social media platforms. This proves that Facebook is an integral part of life for Colombians and that it is here to stay.
The popularity of Facebook in Colombia is driven by the need for family connections. Family groups are quite popular on the platform, with many users joining to stay in touch with their loved ones. Many families set up their own private chat groups on Facebook, allowing them to keep in contact with each other without having to go through the hassle of organizing a physical gathering.
Many Colombians also use Facebook to organize events and activities for their families, such as birthdays and anniversaries. This makes it easy for families to stay connected and celebrate special occasions together, even if they live far apart. Many parents use Facebook to help keep track of their children and ensure they are safe.
I. ama father myself, so I like to keep track of my daughter’s account to make sure she doesn’t speak to weird people too much on FB. There. aremany parental apps that can help you do that, if you want me to create a blog post listing those apps, please let me know in the comments below.
It is evident that Colombians love to stay connected on social media. As of February 2022, 57.2% of social media users in Colombia were women, less than 43% were men, and 33.1% of this group were aged 18-24 years old. Moreover, Filipinos spend an average of 4 hours and 15 minutes every day on social media, making them the worldwide leader in daily usage, followed by Colombia. This means that Colombians are spending a significant amount of time engaging with their favorite social media platforms and connecting with their peers online.
I stayed din Medellin for a few months last year and can confirm that many people use Family group accounts on Facebook to keep in touch with their relatives. I personally use Facebook messenger for that, but that’s just a matter a of personal preference, in my opinion.
When it comes to social media in Colombia, Facebook and WhatsApp top the list with over 90% of users having accounts. But what other popular platforms are available here? Well, YouTube is the most used social network in Colombia with 98 percent of active users accessing the platform. Instagram follows close behind with 77 percent of users regularly using it.
While Elempleo.com, Linkedin, Career Development Center (CTP) and Glassdoor are the most commonly used job boards both by companies and job seekers. With such a wide variety of popular platforms available in Colombia, it’s no wonder that social media use is so widespread here.
I also learned recently that TikTok is becoming very popular among young Colombian teens, so if you have. business that sells products to this demographic, you should listen to my advice and and use Facebook ads and Tiktok ads to promote your company.
As of February 2022, there are an estimated 35.15 million Facebook users in Colombia. The country has the lowest fixed broadband penetration among OECD countries, however, it still ranks first in Latin America when it comes to Facebook usage.
This is likely due to the fact that 92% of Colombians reported visiting Facebook last month and 89% reported using WhatsApp. These two social media outlets are hugely popular throughout the country, with 90% of internet users having an account on either or both.
Most social media users in Colombia are between 18-34 years of age and are active on platforms such as YouTube and Facebook. According to Meta’s advertising resources, women make up 57.2% of the Colombian Facebook user base, and 33.1% of this group are aged between 35-44 years old. Lastly, the typical user has ‘liked’ a median number of 8 pages on Facebook.
I learned that there are millions of Facebook users in Colombia from a documentary about FB that I watched on television last month.
Facebook is extremely popular in Colombia, with over 41 million users as of June 2022. This makes it the 8th largest user of Facebook in the world, and the largest user in Latin America. The popularity of Facebook in this country is due to a number of factors, including the fact that it’s easy to use and widely available.
Its integration with other social media platforms such as WhatsApp means that it’s often used as a platform for communication by many Colombians. As well as this, family and friends often use Facebook to stay in touch and share updates. With such a large user base, Colombia is an important market for businesses looking to advertise on the platform.
In my opinion, which is also backed u by real stats, the United States will always remain the country with the most active Facebook users, especially now that FB changes its name to Meta and they are investing heavily in VR tech for the future. I can’t wait to see what happens in a few years, it’s exciting!
Yes, Colombia does have Facebook and it is the fourth most popular social media platform in the country. According to Meta data, there are 35.15 million Facebook users in Colombia, which makes it the second largest user of Facebook in Latin America. In the 2016 plebiscite, Facebook reached an audience of 32 million Colombians on the Internet.
Whatsapp is ranked number 1 and is the most visited Social Media Networks website in Colombia in December 2022, followed by facebook.com as the runner up.
Oscar Fonseca, a professor in the Department of Communication and Information Technologies at the University of Antioquia, analyzed 100 Facebook profiles from Colombia and conducted 20 interviews. The graph shows that Android has 54.95%, Windows has 19.59% and IOS has 25.45% usage for social media in Colombia from Dec 2021 to Dec 2022. It is clear that Colombian people love their social media and have embraced it with open arms.
When meeting new people in Medellin, I found that whatsapp was the easiest way for me to exchange contact information, especially when I use the QR code scan function.
If you’re looking for the Latin American country with the most Facebook users, then look no further than Colombia. With 35.15 million users, Colombia is the second most popular country in terms of social media usage, behind only Guatemala.
Facebook and WhatsApp are by far the most popular social networks in Colombia, with over 90% of internet users having an account on either platform.
This makes Colombia one of the most active countries in terms of social media usage and internet usage in Latin America, and it’s no wonder why so many people are drawn to the platform. Whether you’re looking to stay connected with family and friends or to find new people to network with, there’s no better place to do it than Facebook!

It’s so easy to use and visually awesome, that I’m hooked on it daily now!
I recently did som research to find what are the best and most famous Pinterest boards in Colombia, and I want to share the results with you below.
Let’s get started!
When it comes to creating an art business, Pinterest is hands down the best platform for it. With the help of Pinterest, I can easily upload images of my own paintings, drawings, and sketches to my “My Art” board. This board is perfect for building my business page and allowing me to discover the best ideas and inspiration for Colombian art.
With this board, I can share and promote my art to gallery curators and art consultants. Additionally, I can use the description area to add links to my website or online store so that people can easily find and purchase my work. So if you want to create an art business, make sure you make the most out of Pinterest’s “My Art” board!
As a Colombian, I’m very proud of my culture and heritage. So it’s no surprise that I love to explore the Colombia Bulletin Board section on Pinterest.

Even if you’re not Colombian or don’t live in Colombia, you can still appreciate the beauty of this board.

I personally prefer to use the Art boards compared to the Bulletin boards, but that’s just my personal preference and you are free do take it or leave it in my opinion.
As a student, I love the idea of having a Colombia bulletin board in our classroom to celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month. After School, Bulletin Board, Lp, September, Frame are all great ideas for decorating and making our classroom more festive. We can use these items to create an eye-catching bulletin board that showcases all the different aspects of Hispanic culture and heritage. This will be something that we can look back on and remember for many years to come.
As someone who loves to explore and discover new places, I was particularly interested in discovering the best Pinterest boards dedicated to Colombia. After digging around, I found a board called “Colombia Who Is My Neighbor, Bubba Keg, Oracion A San Antonio” created by Prendese Bareto. This board is packed with amazing visuals of Colombia’s culture, from Catholic funeral homes in San Diego to May Festival 2013 San Antonio TX! I love this board because it’s a great source for discovering the country’s hidden treasures and attractions.
I also appreciate the variety of topics covered in this board, from Taganga full colombian movie to Queen Bee Taj Mahal Live. This board is a great source of inspiration for anyone looking to learn more about Colombia’s culture and history.
I found that the best thing about this board is the fact that it showcases pins from many different industries at once. that saves me time instead of having to browse through tons of different boards. I just glance at this board quickly while having my breakfast in the morning.

I used to be an artist when I was younger, so this board reminds me of a lot of shows that we created and performed in the past and all the good times that I had in the process.
If you’re a content marketer looking for ideas, Pinterest is a great resource before you buy Pinterest ads for your Pinterest account on this social media platform or for your Pinterest profile or multiple accounts. From blog posts to social media posts and videos, there are hundreds of ideas to help you create valuable content for your customers. To get the most out of Pinterest, start by optimizing your pins and creating targeted ads.
I personally like to reach my target audience by creating blog posts showcasing stats for marketers in Columbia, just like the article that you are reading right now. I found that these articles attract a lot of free links from other blogs and it helps increase how many people see my blog posts and access my website or site at this link shown on the pictures.

I found a great example of the latter by Joanne Chan, which is an amazing visual representation of the creative possibilities that Pinterest offers.

And last but not least, Flag Gallery’s Colombian Flag board is perfect for finding ideas on how to display the colors of Colombia in your home.

Finally, don’t forget to check out Pinterest boards for artists, content marketing ideas, and design ideas for more inspiration.
As a content creator, creating boards aligned to Pinterest’s most popular categories makes good sense. Group boards, where you collaborate with other Pinterest users and you all have permission to add pins to a shared board, can help your pins reach a wider audience. With this in mind, let’s take a look at the best boards about Colombia on Pinterest.
From Kirsten Alana’s 15 Incredible Things To See And Do In Colombia board to Coffee Capsule Master Origin Colombia, there are plenty of inspiring boards to choose from. So whether you’re looking for travel inspiration, recommendations for food and drink, or just want to get creative with your next project, these boards can help you get started.
I’m not a coffee drinker myself, but I still had a quick look at this board while I was researching content for this blog post. It’s great board and I recommend that you check it out too!
As Pinterest grows in popularity, it is no surprise that the platform is seeing a major surge in users from Colombia. In the past year, the number of users from Colombia has been steadily increasing and is projected to reach 3 million by the end of 2022.
When it comes to popular searches on Pinterest, 97% of them are unbranded and consist of 2-3 word queries. This shows that the majority of consumers are looking for inspiration and ideas rather than specific products or services. In Colombia, the top trending searches on Pinterest include “christmas nails”, “popular categories”, “recipes”, “home ideas”, “style inspiration”, and “travel boards”. Moreover, a popular search within the last 30 days is Coffee Capsule Master Origin Colombia. With so many options available on Pinterest, it is no wonder why it has become one of the largest social media platforms in Colombia with an estimated 3.33 million users.
Of course, adult content will always remain the #1 search, but I noticed that the CEO of Pinterest actually blocks those searches to keep 100% of the content safe for work. Which is great in my opinion.
As one of the most renowned online communities for design products and materials, Architonic is quickly becoming a popular choice among Pinterest users. With over 8,000 followers and 617 boards, they have created a list of the 7 best Pinterest accounts to gain inspiration from various topics such as fashion, interior design, and travel. What’s more, they have acquired ArchDaily, the world’s most popular architecture project. With this acquisition, even more users are flocking to Architonic to gain insight into the world of design.
I recently came across some incredible travel boards about Colombia on Pinterest. If you’re looking for inspiration for your next trip to Colombia, then these boards are the perfect place to start. For example, Betty Bravo’s board offers stunning photos of Colombia’s incredible landscapes, Kirsten Alana provides helpful travel tips and itineraries for exploring the country, and Turismo Logo has an array of amazing souvenirs you could pick up on your visit. There’s plenty of inspiration out there to help make the most out of your trip to Colombia. Whether you’re looking for travel guides, photography ideas or simply browsing through Colombian markets, Pinterest is the perfect place to get started.
In conclusion, if you like traveling as much as I do, then you will also like Pinterest travel boards as much as I do, right? Check out the most famous influencers from Colombia.

36,Michael Jordan Hb2 Goes Or The Charlotte Hornets Go,https://abcnews.com.co/michael-jordan-hb2-goes-or-the-charlotte-hornets-go/,"Michael Jordan is well recognized as the co-owner of the Charlotte Hornets in addition to being one of the most accomplished basketball players of all time. The debate that surrounded HB2, a bill that was approved in North Carolina in 2016 that reduced rights for LGBTQ+ persons, has had an effect on the squad in recent years. In this article on your blog, we are going to discuss the effect that HB2 had on the Charlotte Hornets, as well as the part that Michael Jordan had in the debate surrounding the law.
The Debate Surrounding House Bill 2 and Its Effects on the Charlotte Hornets
In the event that you are not familiar with it, House Bill 2 (HB2) was a law that was passed by the legislature of North Carolina in 2016 that mandated individuals to use public restrooms that corresponded to the sex on their birth certificate, rather than the restrooms that corresponded to their gender identity. Moreover, the bill reduced the rights afforded to LGBTQ+ individuals in the workplace and in places of public accommodation. The NCAA and the ACC both rescheduled their championship events to take place outside of North Carolina in response to the legislation. The NBA reacted to the bill by relocating the 2017 All-Star Game from Charlotte to New Orleans. The city of Charlotte and the Charlotte Hornets both had severe financial repercussions as a result of this.

Michael Jordan was the majority owner of the Charlotte Hornets when the dispute arose. At this period, the controversy occurred. At the beginning, he maintained his silence on the matter, which resulted in his receiving criticism from a few individuals who believed that he ought to have made use of his position in order to speak out against the discriminatory law. On the other hand, Jordan issued a statement in July 2016 in which he said that he was opposed to discrimination as well as the failure of North Carolina to safeguard the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals. Some believed that Jordan’s answer was too little, too late, and commended him for taking a stance, while others complimented him for taking a stand.
The ownership stake held by Michael Jordan in the Charlotte Hornets
In 2006, Jordan purchased a partial ownership stake in the Charlotte Bobcats, then in 2010 he purchased the franchise fully for a total price of $275 million. During that time, he has made significant investments in the development of the franchise, including as appointing head coach Steve Clifford in 2013 and acquiring star player Kemba Walker. In recent years, the squad has seen both highs and lows, but overall, they’ve done rather well in the Eastern Conference despite these fluctuations. In addition to his work with the club, Jordan has been actively engaged in the city of Charlotte via the Jordan Brand as well as through the humanitarian work he has done.
The Prospects for the Charlotte Hornets’ Long-Term Success
The Charlotte Hornets are a youthful and dynamic team as of the 2021-2022 NBA season. Stars like LaMelo Ball and Miles Bridges are leading the way for this Hornets squad. They have recently seen some success, including earning a berth in the play-in tournament that will take place during the 2021 NBA playoffs. But, there is still a significant amount of work to be done before they can be considered real contenders in the Eastern Conference. It is difficult to determine the extent to which the HB2 debate had an affect on the team’s performance; nonetheless, it is certain that the city and the team both suffered financially as a result of the loss of the All-Star Game and other events.
Conclusion
The convergence of sports and politics is sometimes a contentious issue, and the debate over HB2 in North Carolina was no exception to this general rule. Several people questioned Michael Jordan’s attitude to the incident, while others complimented him for it; yet, it is certain that the effect of the legislation was felt by the Charlotte Hornets as well as the community of Charlotte as a whole. As the squad looks forward into the future, it will be fascinating to see how they will continue to develop as a unit under Jordan’s and others’ guidance.

37,Obama Signs Executive Order Banning Sale Of Assault Weapons,https://abcnews.com.co/obama-signs-executive-order-banning-sale-of-assault-weapons/,"On January 16th, 2013, former President Barack Obama signed an executive order banning the sale of assault weapons in the United States. This was a significant move in the ongoing debate over gun control and Second Amendment rights.
So, what exactly is an assault weapon? In general, an assault weapon is a firearm designed for rapid fire and military-style use. They often have features such as high-capacity magazines, pistol grips, and folding stocks. Examples of assault weapons include the AR-15 and AK-47.
Many people believe that assault weapons should be banned due to their potential for mass casualties in mass shootings. Obama’s executive order sought to address this concern by prohibiting the sale of assault weapons to civilians.
Under the executive order, any firearms that meet the definition of an assault weapon are prohibited from being sold or transferred. The order also bans the sale of high-capacity magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition. However, the order did not affect existing weapons, meaning that people who already owned assault weapons were allowed to keep them.
The rationale behind the executive order was to increase public safety and reduce the number of mass shootings in the United States. Proponents of the order argue that limiting the availability of assault weapons will make it more difficult for people to commit these types of crimes.
However, the executive order was not without controversy. Some critics argue that the ban is an infringement on Second Amendment rights and that it will do little to actually reduce gun violence. In fact, some argue that the ban will only make it harder for law-abiding citizens to obtain the weapons they need for self-defense.
The executive order was met with mixed reactions from politicians, gun control advocates, and gun rights advocates. Many Democrats praised the move, while many Republicans criticized it. Gun control advocates generally supported the ban, while gun rights advocates opposed it.
In the years since the executive order was signed, the debate over gun control has only intensified. While the ban on assault weapons is still in place, it remains to be seen whether it will have a significant impact on reducing gun violence in the United States.
In conclusion, Obama’s executive order banning the sale of assault weapons was a significant moment in the ongoing debate over gun control and Second Amendment rights. While some see it as an important step toward increasing public safety, others view it as an infringement on their rights. As the debate continues, it is important to consider the complex issues at play and strive for a solution that balances the needs of both sides.

38,Tv Buddy Caster Reviews,https://abcnews.com.co/tv-buddy-caster-reviews/,"In this day and age, having a Netflix membership is virtually the same as owning a TV in your own home. These types of subscription services provide customers with additional viewing options, in addition to a wider selection of material to choose from. Up until I made the decision to purchase a TV Buddy Caster, I had been viewing the episodes on my phone.
In this review of TV Buddy Caster, I’ll walk you through my experiences and discuss my ideas with you. Let’s start.

The Relatively Small Screen
Since I can remember, my go-to hobby is spending time in front of the television or the big screen watching movies or series. And I’ve been a subscriber to Netflix ever since the very first day it was available to the public. My major devices for consuming media from these streaming services have been my mobile phone and my laptop.
My wife has only just begun to participate in the activity with me. However, viewing the programs on such little displays was difficult for both of us at the same time. Additionally, my television is not a smart one. I already own a television that is rather big, and the thought of purchasing a second television only for the purpose of viewing movies made me cringe.
As a result, I embarked on a hunt for information on streaming gadgets. The pricing of conventional ones such as the Google Chromecast made me feel like I was about to have a heart attack. Up until the point that I discovered TV Buddy Casters. A streaming apparatus that is both easy on the wallet and cutting edge.
What specifically is the TVBuddy Caster?
The tool looks just like what it describes itself to be. It replicates on the TV whatever is shown on the screen of your mobile device or laptop computer. It is unquestionably designed to resemble the Google Chromecast, but it is far less expensive. I have been relying on it for the last half a year, and I must say that I have been really pleased by its dependability.
My first reaction was one of skepticism over the potential profitability of the venture. The quality of the image sometimes suffers while using screen mirroring devices, which is a typical issue. If you have a TV Buddy Casters, you won’t have to worry about dealing with that issue. It takes use of the most recent developments in decoding technology to provide you with a view of the video that is in full high definition (HD).

The TV does not need a separate subscription to your favorite provider in addition to what you already have. Your current account, which you access on your mobile device or laptop, is sufficient for this purpose. Remember that it is unable to generate its own material on its own. If you come across any reviews that claim that it can, you can assume that it is a hoax.
Characteristics and Advantages of the TVBuddy Caster
This product offers a staggering number of useful functions, which is one of the reasons I like it so much. It is more than simply a gadget for mirroring what’s on your screen. It provides the users with access to a Pandora’s box full of cutting-edge features and functions while they are on the go.
When it comes to proprietary gadgets like the Chromecast, privacy is a valid issue that should be taken into consideration. With TV Buddy Casters, you completely get rid of the problem. Because this gadget is incapable of recording or monitoring your whereabouts, you are free to go about your business without worrying about compromising your privacy. Your information is not at risk in any way.
Top-notch Connection: The connectivity offered by TVBuddy Caster is without a doubt one of the aspects that I like the most. Because my television does not have wifi, I had to connect it to my television using the HDMI connection that was included in the packaging. In terms of the connection to the origin, it is compatible with both the 2.4G and the 5G wifi bands. The HD streaming experience is provided to your mobile device or laptop by connecting to the service over wifi.
Excellent: The TV Buddy Casters is an outstanding video decoder. High Quality You will get the highest possible quality of video feedback thanks to the use of H.265 decoding. The decoding is carried out in real time, and the processing power available is sufficient to deal with any kind of video. If your internet connection is strong, you won’t experience any latency at all in the game. It is compatible with a variety of video formats like FLV, VOB, MKV, and AVI, among others.
Compatibility: Because you need to connect TVBuddy Caster to either your phone or laptop, the issue of compatibility quickly becomes front and center. The answer to that question is that it is compatible with mobile devices running Android, iOS, and Windows.
Easy Configuration: There is no need to install any drivers or perform any complicated configurations in order to use TVBuddy Caster. It may be used immediately after being plugged in. When I originally acquired it, it helped me save a significant amount of time.

There isn’t much to say about how to use the TVBuddy Caster since it’s a gadget that just plugs in and starts working. An HDMI cable is used to make the connection to the television. There might be a problem with the connection if your television does not have an HDMI port. It’s possible that you’ll need to employ a converter for this. In my experience, this was not the case. The fact that most contemporary televisions are equipped with a number of HDMI connections is a positive development.
It is important to keep in mind that TVBuddy does not have its own operating system to stream content from subscription services. This is something users should keep in mind. It is dependent on your mobile device in order to function. You do this by using wifi to establish a connection between your source device and it. Once TV Buddy Casters has been activated, you will be able to locate it in the wifi menu of your mobile device or laptop. After you connect it, you should be set to go.
It is compatible with 2.4G as well as 5G networks. Even if your internet connection is a little bit poor, you may anticipate faultless performance with TVBuddy as long as you have a 5G router in your house.
The only wire that’s visible is the HDMI, so everything looks really neat and organized overall.
If you conduct your own research, you could uncover some TV Buddy reviews that talk about cons associated with the service. It is essential to place your purchase for the goods directly with the company that made it in the first place. It is also sold by certain third-party retailers, however the authenticity of the product should always be a primary concern.
In my own experience, I have discovered that TV Buddy Casters are an excellent asset to have in the house. It has been functioning extremely well so far. In my capacity as a rational human being, I went online before making my purchase in order to research what other customers had to say about the item.
When I bring you anything, I always double check to make sure that it is a genuine product before I hand it to you. Reading evaluations written by other customers is just one part of the equation; the other part is my own personal experience. Let’s have a look at what others on the internet are saying about the TVBuddy Caster.
“When I purchased this, I was under the impression that it was only a screen mirroring device. I had some reservations about the product’s overall level of excellence. When I first received my TV Buddy Casters, I was pleasantly impressed by the high level of craftsmanship that went into making them. It has a highly quality feel to it and is quite strong. And it was not a gadget that could reflect my screen as I had hoped it would be. Because high definition (HD) video is what I always see when I turn on my television, I believe that this program makes use of some kind of video enhancement technology. In comparison to its cost, it’s an excellent purchase.
Bronson, who is thirty years old
I only lately started making it a routine to watch a few minutes of television before I turn in for the night. At first, I was watching everything on my phone. My cheek was accidentally hit by the phone a few times as I got closer and closer to falling asleep. It began to annoy me more and more. I also wasn’t prepared to spend the money on a streaming gadget of the highest caliber. After receiving a recommendation to give TV Buddy Casters a go from one of my other pals, I made the decision to do so. What am I supposed to say then? Before I go to bed, I don’t have to worry about my nose being stuffed up since I can watch anything. I can’t get over how well it works!
He is 26 years old, Luther.
“I don’t believe that I am a person who is really knowledgeable with technology. Concern set up when I placed my order for the TVBuddy Caster. My stomach was in knots because I was so anxious about having to go through the installation procedure. However, everything was resolved by following the TV Buddy installation instructions. It took me by surprise how simple it was to do. I have just finished connecting the cable to my TV. My search for the ideal port was fraught with difficulties. When I finally had everything worked out, I couldn’t help but chuckle at myself and think about how foolish it was of me to believe that the installation would be difficult.
He is 55 years old, Rowan.
Price and Availability of the TV Buddy Caster in the United Kingdom
If you want to take advantage of all of the advantages, it is imperative that you purchase a genuine product, as I have previously explained. You have the right to the legitimate product since you are a member of my audience, plus I have negotiated a coupon good for a reduction of fifty percent off the cost of TV Buddy particularly for you.

Additionally, the company is happy to provide you with a money-back guarantee for a period of thirty days.
Conclusion
Who doesn’t appreciate watching movies when they’re projected onto a large screen? I most certainly do! In addition, I am pleased to report that the choice I made to go with the TV Buddy Casters was quite successful.

39,Gay Wedding Mobile Vans Legalization Of Gay Marriage,https://abcnews.com.co/gay-wedding-mobile-vans-legalization-of-gay-marriage/,"The commemoration of a couple’s love and dedication to one another is a tradition that is observed all over the world and bridges the gap between people of different cultures and geographic locations.
Nevertheless, owing to the absence of legal acknowledgment of their relationships, this experience has been unavailable for far too long for a significant number of couples who identify as being part of the LGBTQ+ community.
The battle for marriage equality has been a long and grueling one; nevertheless, the tide has finally shifted, and marriage between people of the same sexual orientation is now legal in many nations throughout the globe.
In this piece, we investigate the rise of gay wedding mobile vans and the relevance of these vans in relation to the fight for marriage equality.
The wedding business has seen a considerable transition over the years as a result of the growing demand from couples for wedding services that are both more customized and more convenient. The ease and adaptability of mobile wedding services have contributed to the rise in demand for these kinds of packages. Much progress has been made in the wedding business over the last few years with the introduction of mobile vans that cater only to homosexual couples wanting to be married.
These mobile vans are meant to provide a comprehensive selection of wedding services, which may include photography, floral arrangements, officiants, and musical performances. They are designed to cater exclusively to the requirements of LGBTQ+ couples, giving them a place that is free from danger and full of warmth in which to celebrate their love and commitment to one another. These services are especially popular in countries that permit marriages between people of the same gender, despite the fact that same-sex marriages may not be broadly recognized in all communities.

Mobile vans for gay weddings provide a number of advantages to couples who want to commemorate their love in a manner that is distinctive and individual. The fact that these services may be reached easily and quickly is one of the most important benefits that they provide. The fact that the van will come to the couple eliminates the need for them to worry about locating an appropriate location or arranging with a number of different providers. Since the mobile van takes care of everything, the happy couple can concentrate on enjoying this momentous day.
One further perk is the high degree of customisation and adaptability that gay wedding mobile vans provide for their clients. The wedding ceremony and reception may be designed by the couple in collaboration with the various providers to the couple’s precise preferences. When it comes to typical wedding locations, which may have predetermined guidelines and policies, achieving this degree of adaptability and originality is not always achievable.
Last but not least, mobile vans for gay weddings might be an affordable solution for couples that are working with a limited budget. Since everything is in a single location, there is no need to pay for numerous venue rents or transportation for the vendors. This may let the couple have a more economical wedding while still enabling them to celebrate in a unique manner.
The influence that the legalization of homosexual marriage will have on the bridal business
The LGBTQ+ community has reached a historic milestone with the legalization of same-sex marriage, which provides a long-delayed acknowledgement of their relationships. This recognition was long needed. Because of this shift in the legislation, the wedding industry has been significantly impacted, and as a result, suppliers and venues are now aggressively catering to the demands of LGBTQ+ couples.
Gay wedding mobile vans have been at the forefront of this transformation, offering a secure and accepting venue for same-sex couples to celebrate their love. These vans have been at the vanguard of this movement. These services have also contributed to the wedding business being more inclusive and varied, which is a trend that is beneficial for everyone involved.
The arguments for and against the use of mobile vans for homosexual weddings
Even though they have been mostly well-received, gay wedding mobile vans have been met with some opposition from conservative organizations who oppose marriage between people of the same sexual orientation. In addition, some individuals who identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community have attacked these services on the grounds that they uphold heteronormative customs.
It is essential to point out that despite the validity of these complaints, gay wedding mobile vans provide a secure and inviting venue for same-sex couples to celebrate their love in a manner that is significant to them. This is something that should not be overlooked. In addition, just like with any other kind of service, it is up to the bride and groom to pick which rituals and customs they would want to include into their wedding ceremony.

To summarize, gay wedding mobile vans are an important breakthrough in the wedding business. They provide LGBTQ+ couples a secure and inclusive environment to celebrate their love and commitment, which is a big step forward for the industry.

The outcome of the investigation will bring much-needed clarity and openness to the election process and will help rebuild the public’s confidence in the election system.
The directive has elicited mixed reactions from political leaders and the general public. Proponents of the directive see it as a necessary step to guarantee the credibility of the election process and to hold those responsible for any improprieties accountable. Detractors of the directive argue that it is a politically motivated move intended to cast doubt on the election results and to undermine the legitimacy of the newly elected government.
The public opinion has been greatly affected, with many citizens expressing strong opinions on both sides of the issue. Some view the directive as a positive step towards ensuring the credibility of the election process, while others see it as a threat to democracy and the legitimacy of the election results.
Analysis of the Examination Process
The examination will be carried out by the Department of Justice and will encompass a comprehensive review of all elements of the election. The examination will comply with federal law and the results will be made public once the examination is completed.
Expectations for the examination are high, as many citizens and political leaders anticipate that it will bring clarity and openness to the election process. The examination results will be used to determine if there were any violations of federal law, and if so, those responsible will be held accountable.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the directive issued by Barack Obama calling for an investigation into the election results is a crucial step towards ensuring the credibility of the election process and restoring the public’s confidence in the election system. The examination process that will follow will be comprehensive and will bring much-needed clarity and openness to the election process.

PHOENIX, A.Z. (AP) — The world’s biggest Starbucks will be opening in downtown Phoenix, Arizona this November. The new Starbucks will also be the largest coffee shop in the world, seating up to 2,155 patrons, vastly surpassing the Al Masaa Café in Saudi Arabia which can seat up to 1,050 customers at one time.
“This new Starbucks will be the best place to be on the planet!” Paul Horner, a spokesman for Starbucks told ABC News. “It’s gonna have it all! Rides, games, robot baristas and every type of coffee imaginable. This will not be your average coffee shop to get a cup of joe, this will be a life changing experience. If you’re not here, you’re not anywhere.”
The three story, 51,000 square foot building, appropriately dubbed “Magnum” (Magnum means ‘big’ in Latin), will be host to numerous games, rides and more coffee than humanly imaginable.
On the Starbucks information page for Magnum, the company says the establishment will include the following:
Robot baristas
Shooting gallery
Roller coaster
Above and below-ground water slide
560 different flavors of coffee
Restaurant
Starbucks coffee & dining section for children
Pendulum ride
Ping pong
Coffee bean bounce house

“I’m so happy that more commercialized coffee franchises like Starbucks are moving into the area. Spots like Jobot, Lola and Songbird are just frequented by too many free-thinkers,” says 39-year-old local Phoenix resident Phil Freedom. “I’m also relieved that the Children’s Hospital that was planned for this location is now permanently put on hold; what an eyesore that would have been.”

“Biggest Starbucks ever headed to Phoenix,” the company said in a tweet today. Also released today in a video on the company website from Starbuck’s president Tom Downey claiming, “Magnum Starbucks will be the Willy Wonka of coffee.”
Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a local charity that provides the Valley’s homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, spoke with CNN about the new Starbucks.
“We need more homeless shelters and places to help those in need, not more corporate establishments. So much artwork and beauty is being lost to these monstrosities it’s ridiculous. We need to support local businesses and keep these corporate giants out.” Bradley continued, “Also, thank you to everyone that has supported our cause in giving new socks to the homeless, it means so much. Please, give what you can.”
A Grand Opening is planned for Magnum with the folks from Guinness World Records in attendance should any coffee related records be broken. EMT’s and defibrillators will be on hand in case any caffeine related emergencies occur. Prizes include a trip to the Bahamas and a brand new 2016 Honda Civic. Planned events for possible world records include:
The new Starbucks will be located at the corner of 7th Avenue and Roosevelt in the trendy downtown art’s district of Phoenix.

Celebrities making an appearance at the Grand Opening are Bill Murray, Quentin Tarantino, Katy Perry and Jennifer Lawrence. A Starbucks pre-Grand Opening party is planned for this Thursday (9/15/16) at 9PM at The Lost Leaf for The Mystery Show in downtown Phoenix. Bill Murray will be making an appearance.

43,Fireman Suspended & Jailed By Atheist Mayor For Praying At Scene Of Fire – ABC News,https://abcnews.com.co/fireman-suspended-and-jailed-by-atheist-mayor/,"DEQUINCY, LA (AP) — Early this morning, a small town in Louisiana suspended one of its firefighters, 39-year-old Ronnie Edwards, without pay for praying while on duty at the scene of a fire. Edwards, who has been with the DeQuincy Fire Department since he was 21, was also arrested and sentenced to 30 days in jail.
“I just do what our Lord & Savior, Jesus Christ, would do,” Edwards told local DeQuincy news station DQLA6. “It’s not about me, it’s about spreading his message, you know? He works through me, I’m just fortunate enough to be part of that.”
According to sources within the DeQuincy Fire Department, Edwards, known to locals as “The Praying Fireman”, has been praying at the scene of fires since he joined the department in 1998, and it is only recently that the ritual has become an issue.
“Ronnie [Edwards] would always pray after we put out a fire, most of the time in the front yard or something,” fellow firefighter Eugene Ketchum said. “It never really bothered anyone, it was just something he did. We put our lives on the line whenever we respond to a fire. I figure if praying helps him out then why not let the guy pray?”
Ketchum said that things changed in 2014 when DeQuincy elected the first democratic mayor in its history, an African American atheist named Lawana Jones. He said that when Jones heard that Edwards made a habit of praying at fires she sent a memo to all city employees advising them that any expression of personal religious belief while on duty was a violation of their contract with the city.
According to DeQuincy city attorney Paul Horner, Jones made four previous attempts to address the issue personally with Edwards, but Edwards became more defiant with each meeting.
“Refusal to obey an official city order is a misdemeanor and we must take action to address the crime,” Horner told reporters. “We didn’t want to suspend the man and have him arrested but we were out of options.”
Mayor Jones, spoke with ABC News, about her decision to suspend and imprison Edwards for praying while at work.
“I’m not anti-religious,” said Mayor Jones in a written statement, “But there is an appropriate time and place for everything. When he prays while on duty, he gives the impression that the City of DeQuincy is endorsing one particular religion over another. That is not the message that my office wants to send; it’s not what the people of DeQuincy elected me to do.” Jones continued, “If you live in a county where democracy is established, you should be aware that the idea of the separation of church and state is the only way to prevent the government from forcing religion on you and directing your religion and its doctrines.

Religion is one of the most important factors in most people’s lives and it should be treated with reverence. In order to keep the government from directing religion and making it change how you are allowed to believe, church and state need to be separate. This allows for more openness when it comes to the decisions of the country. And in a world where everyone has different beliefs and different religions, a forced religion can cause an uprising and the dissolvent of a nation. You’re supposed to do your job, not involve politics and religion into it.”
ACLU spokesperson Cassandra Schmidt told ABC News the organization supports Mayor Jones’ “devotion to the separation of church and state” and said that the ACLU would cover 100% of the city’s legal fees should Mr. Edwards try and sue the city.
Jones won the office after promising to fix the city’s fledgling schools and bring new economic opportunity to the area. In that time, she has brought in over 300 good paying jobs, which has enabled her to increase city funding to the DeQuincy school district by 32%. DeQuincy’s test scores have also already shown significant improvement.
Still, many in the town are wondering if what they have gained is worth what they have lost.
“My brother wasn’t hurtin’ nobody,” Edwards’s 30-year-old sister Tami Hobart said. “Most people in DeQuincy is Christian, and I think we all took comfort in knowing that his heart was right with the Lord before he risked his life. It feels like we sold our souls to get that cat food factory and them fancy new textbooks.”
Republican Presidential Nominee, Donald Trump, caught wind of Edward’s misfortune and while speaking to Fox News offered some harsh words for Mayor Jones.
“I can tell you; when I win the White House, there’s gonna be changes in DeQuincy. They’re gonna reinstate Ronnie Edwards, they’re gonna give him his back pay, they’re gonna give him restitution for the time he spent in jail, and Lawana Jones is going to pay for it. And if Mayor Jones doesn’t want to do that, I’ll have her thrown in jail so fast her head will spin.”
David Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, a website known for its biased opinions and inaccurate aricles they write about stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing.
“You have to understand that when a story like this goes viral, and we spend a minute or two debunking it, we make lots of money. Stories like this have helped put my children through college, buy a new car, a home and even get the sex reassignment surgery my wife Barbara always wanted since she was a little boy,” Mikkleson said. “We claim ‘to provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as well‘, but that’s just ridiculous.
Do you know how much time that would take? Instead, we just copy and paste parts of the original article into ours, write a couple sentences, and that’s it. I just want to be clear, our website does zero journalism or anything creative, and I’m only telling you this for legal reasons.” Mikkleson continues, “A typical story of ours makes wild claims, using grammatical errors, misspellings and words like ‘umimumimaginative’, ‘recycled’, ‘hoax’, saying that a story ‘illegally appropriates the trademarks of legitimate news organizations’, but we list no links or sources of information, they are all just wild claims by us.
And that story will get 50,000 shares or more on Facebook, that’s a lot of ad revenue for only writing a couple sentences.” Mikkelson further explains, “It is common for us to rewrite a story we’re debunking if we don’t like it. In one recent story of ours, we actually removed a person’s name from the original article and then called him a liar, it’s so funny!
We also like to post fake, un-funny, juvenile disclaimers supposedly from the site in question and it is our authors, such as Jeff Zarronandia who are responsible for those gems. We tell our readers that the disclaimer is from the story we are debunking, but a simple google search will show that our disclaimer is 100% fabricated. Sometimes I think that someone should start a company that debunks our debunkings, they could probably make a lot of money,” Mikkelson laughs. “And lots of people complain and complain about our authors attacking websites and their owners for reasons that are 100% proven false, but since we block archive.org it just becomes their word versus ours.
Our writers like Zarronandia go as far as to say that the story originated from ‘a clickbait fake news site that infringes the trademark-protected visual elements and domain names of legitimate news outlets in order to generate traffic and drive advertising revenues by creating and spreading entirely false “news” stories‘. But we don’t list ONE factual piece of evidence to back up our claims; It’s just more of our hack, unethical journalism, and as I said before, I only tell you this for legal reasons. I think it is business as usual for us to accuse the story we are debunking of spreading malware and viruses, but we never say what website it actually is.
I think warning people about a site that could potentially destroy their computer is probably a good idea, and I hope one day to do that kind of ethical journalism, but people will click our ads regardless, bottom line; so why do the extra work?”
In spite of all that has happened, Edwards says that he is not bitter.
“The Bible says that there will be sacrifices when you choose to follow the path of righteousness; it says that you will be reviled by the wicked. I will continue to pray that Mayor Jones comes to accept Jesus Christ, and will keep praying that God sees fit to put Donald Trump in the White House, but whether or not any of that happens, I still trust God and know that everything is happening according to his divine plan.”
Edwards is scheduled to begin serving his 30-day jail sentence at the DeQuincy City Jail on November 5th, the same day as Paul Horner’s birthday. Edwards told ABC News that he encourages, “Those wishing to support his cause, to support a charity that gives news socks to the homeless, called Sock It Forward.”
If you have any questions regarding the case, you can contact the DeQuincy City Attorney’s Office.

44,Secret Service Agent Says Obama Is Gay & Muslim In New Tell-All Book,https://abcnews.com.co/secret-service-says-obama-is-gay-muslim-in-new-book/,"A book by a former Secret Service agent claims Barack Obama is a gay Muslim. (AP Photo/Dennis System, File) / AP WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) — A former Secret Service agent whose new book is quickly climbing Amazon’s best-seller charts, said he is concerned about the state of the country and says it is time the public knows the real truth about our Commander in Chief, Barack Obama.
Former agent, Paul Horner, in his new tell-all book “The Black House,” reveals what goes on inside the White House when the news cameras are turned off.
In an interview with ABC News, Horner told Senior Political Analyst Tom Downey that he is one-hundred-percent positive that President Barack Obama is not only gay, but a radical Muslim as well.
“Everyone on the inside knows that Obama is gay and a Muslim, it is common knowledge,” Horner said. “I saw many men coming and going from Obama’s room, at all hours. I would say a good portion of the men, over fifty-percent, were Muslim.”
Downey: “In your book you talk about several rituals Obama performed to unwind from his busy schedule. Can you elaborate on these for our readers?”
Horner: “When no one was around, except his security, Obama couldn’t wait to get out of his suit and into his Muslim tunic. He would wear it while praying to the prophet Muhammad throughout the day. During these prayer sessions he insisted that he not be disturbed.”
Downey: “In the book you talk about Obama and his thoughts on Islamic law. Do you care to explain?”
Horner: “He would tell me all the time that before his Presidency was over, he had plans to sign an Executive Orders implementing Sharia law. He said he was determined to change most of the statutes in America to Muslim law.”
Downey: “In chapter three of the book, you write about Obama’s ideas and plans for gun control in this country. Can you give us a brief summary of what you were talking about?”
Horner: “Obama would always talk about his plans for taking away the rights for Americans to bear arms. He basically wanted to do away with the Second Amendment. This would worry me, drastically.”
Downey: “Can you give us any insight on Obama’s feelings towards the American people?”
Horner: “He constantly made jokes about Americans, frequently referring to them as “mongoloids” and “idiots”. Christians were his favorite verbal punching bags. He has absolutely no respect for the Christian religion. I believe he actually hates Christians, and finds their ideology to be old fashioned and ignorant.”
Downey: “Your book spends a whole chapter devoted to the various “tortures” that Obama and the First Lady would subject you to. Can you explain?”
Horner: “Because most of us were white, Obama would force us to listen to Diana Ross at full volume, every day, at all hours of the night. It was horrible, I never got any sleep. This is one of the main reasons I finally had to quit.”
Downey: “What are some of the things the public will find the most shocking?”
Horner: “Probably the sheer amount of men he welcomed into his bed quarters. I am in no way homophobic, but Obama’s insatiable lust for homosexual liaisons is like nothing I’ve ever witnessed. We’re talking ten or more partners in a single day.”
Downey: “That’s amazing, ten or more men in a single day? Wow.”

Horner: “Also, at least once a day, Obama would have us log on to Facebook to support a page about a Dolphin named Fappy who travels around the country speaking to elementary school children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation. It was all very, very strange stuff.”
Downey: “In the book you do mention various charities that Obama was passionate about, which I found quite interesting. What are some of those charities that the President would work with?”
Horner: “Most of the charities Obama would focus on had something to do with the Muslim community or promoting Islam in America. Though there was one charity that even I donated to. It was called ‘Sock It Forward‘. They gave new socks directly to homeless people all around the country. I thought it was truly fascinating what they did. Talking with the volunteers from that charity, I learned that socks are the most desired item at homeless shelters, but the least donated. Within this interview, I please ask that ABC News adds a link to their founder’s recent interview about their organization and a link to donate. The Muslim charities that Obama endorsed, I don’t care to talk about.”
Downey: “We sure can do that Mr. Horner. For those reading this article, here is a link to the founder’s interview, click here. Along with that, here is a link for those wishing to donate socks or money to their cause, click here.”
Downey: “Is there anything else you can tell us?”
Horner: “Yeah,” Horner smiles. “Buy the book.”

45,"Omar Mateen’s Final Text To Wife Released: “I’m Gay, That’s Why I’m Doing This.” – ABC News",https://abcnews.com.co/omar-mateens-final-text-to-wife-released-im-gay/,"ORLANDO F.L. (AP) — The FBI today released the final text message sent out by Omar Mateen to his wife just two hours after he started his attack at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando that killed 49 people and injured 53 others. In the text, Mateen said, “I’m gay. I hate myself, and that’s why I’m doing this.”
The Muslim gunman who committed the Pulse nightclub massacre in Orlando, was “100 percent” gay and bore a grudge against Latino men because he felt used by them, according to a man who says he was his lover for two months.
“I’ve cried like you have no idea. But the thing that makes me want to tell the truth is that he didn’t do it for terrorism. In my opinion he did it for revenge,” he told Univision Noticias anchor Maria Elena Salinas in an exclusive interview in English and Spanish on Tuesday.
He said Mateen was angry and upset after a man he had sex with later revealed he was infected with the HIV virus.
Asked why he decided to come forward with his story, he said: “It’s my responsibility as a citizen of the United States and a gay man.”
Seddique Mateen, Omar Mateen’s father claimed his son was seeking retribution against the gay community.
In a video posted on Facebook, Seddique Mateen said his 29-year-old son, Omar Mateen, shouldn’t have gone on the killing spree because ‘God himself will punish those involved in homosexuality’, according to a translation by the Washington Post.
In an earlier interview, he said there was no sign of any trouble when he saw his son just hours before the mass shooting, and he denied suggestions his son was radicalized or an ISIS sympathizer.
This text released today by the FBI comes as no surprise to those who study human behavior. A 1996 study, published in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology, found a strong link between professed homophobia and homosexual arousal. “You can’t hate something so much without hating that about yourself, that’s Psychology 101”, said Dr. Paul Horner, professor of psychology at the University of Central Florida. “Mateen was raised as a Muslim by a father who was very much a homophobe himself.
When you are raised to believe that your natural desires, desires which are beyond your own control, are sick and evil, it creates severe psychological problems that persist well into adulthood. There is really no telling how many more Omar Mateens are out there. Omar couldn’t be gay because of his religion. His actions and all the innocent lives he took had nothing to do with terrorism.”
The shooting has generated a mixed response among America’s conservatives, a group which is heavily influenced by Islam’s Abrahamic cousin, Christianity. Many Christians have spoken out against the shooting and say that it is a perfect example of why Islam is so dangerous and why its spread must be stopped.
Many other Christians, such as Arizona Pastor Steven Anderson, have actually celebrated this attack, saying that this was a well-deserved punishment being visited upon the wicked by a righteous and vengeful God.
Dr. Cassandra Schmidt, professor of religious studies at the Central University of Northern Texas in Wichita Falls sees the development of a disturbing trend.
“Many people have bought into the notion recently that Christianity is somehow less dangerous than Islam because there are not as many acts of high-profile Christian terrorism, but this viewpoint ignores the fact that Christianity’s influence on Western civilization has been tempered by centuries of enlightenment thinking and scientific discoveries. Since the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980, there has been a huge backlash against all things intellectual in this country, and in that time, Christianity has been moving very steadily in a much more fundamentalist direction.
As the number of non-religious Americans continues to grow, I think you’re only going to see those who remain in the faith get more and more conservative and more and more detached from reality. At the rate things are going, I wouldn’t be at all surprised to see certain American Christians practicing female circumcision and honor killing within the next thirty years.”
Dr. Schmidt’s thoughts were echoed by a high ranking member of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles who describes himself as a “practicing homosexual”. For obvious reasons he agreed to speak with ABC news solely on a condition of anonymity. “The Muslim world behaves this way because they do not know any better; they do not have the advantage of being guaranteed a right to a secular education.
Most Christians do, yet many are choosing to ignore what they have learned in favor of an ideology that, at its core, is almost indistinguishable from radical Islam. What most Americans do not realize is that there was a time long ago when the Muslim community was actually one of the world leaders in math, science, and technology and that during this time women in the Muslim world were actually treated far better than women in other religions throughout India and the Middle East were.
Islam got to where it is today by turning its back on those enlightenment principles and embracing hardline religious doctrine in its place. It’s pretty obvious to even the most casual observer that this is where Christianity is headed.”
ABC news decided to take to the streets of Las Vegas to ask everyday Americans what they thought about Omar Mateen’s motivations for the attack. Most of the people who spoke with ABC news tended to agree that this was the act of a self-loathing homosexual and not that of an ISIS operative.
Allison Stewart, a rattlesnake farmer from Yucca, Arizona who was attending a trade show at the MGM Grand said that “I think it’s a load of [expletive] that people are trying to pin this whole thing on ISIS. The guy had nothing to do with ISIS. He loved [male genitalia] but he didn’t have the [male genitalia] to admit it. So he killed the part of himself he hated that he saw in those other people and blamed it on ISIS like a little [expletive].”
The Westboro Baptist Church, which is well known for its funeral protests and anti-gay activism, has already declared its intent to protest the Orlando victims’ funeral because of Mateen’s homosexuality. The organization routinely celebrates the deaths of homosexuals and others whom the church deems to be sinners or sodomites.
Shirley Phelps Roper offered her thoughts about Mateen to ABC news this morning via skype.
“I really wish that they would stop trying to tie this attack directly to ISIS. It is wrong to sully the name of such a wonderful organization by attaching this little [gay slur]’s name to it. Omar Mateen was a homosexual, and because he was raised in the ways of God’s righteous law, the weight of his sins ate away at his conscience until he snapped. God bless Islam, without it, this incident never would have happened. Westboro Baptist Church fully supports ISIS and its efforts to wipe homosexuals and infidels from the planet.

We pledge our undying spiritual and financial support to them, with the hopes that they will inspire more conflicted homosexuals to follow Mateen’s lead. Just because you have homosexual desires doesn’t mean you should act on them. I’ve been attracted to women since I was 13, but I chose to turn that sickness over to the Lord. If you’re not willing to do that, you deserve what’s coming to you.”
David Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, a website known for its biased opinions and inaccurate information they write about stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing.
“You have to understand that when a story like this goes viral, and we spend a minute or two debunking it, we make lots of money. Stories like this have helped put my children through college, buy a new car, a home and even get the gender reassignment surgery my wife Barbara has always wanted since she was a little boy,” Mikkleson said. “We claim ‘to provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as well‘, but that’s just ridiculous.
Do you know how much time that would take? Instead, we just copy and paste parts of the original article into ours, write a couple sentences, and that’s it. I just want to be clear, our website does zero journalism or anything creative, and I’m only telling you this for legal reasons. For example, do you remember that recent article we wrote debunking a story which claimed Scientology lost its tax-exempt status? Did you actually read our story? Who is the name of the person responsible for the hoax? What is the actual website URL? We claim to know it, but no real information is posted by us.”
Mikkelson continues, “It is common for us to rewrite a story we’re debunking if we don’t like it. In one recent story of ours, we actually removed a person’s name from the original article and then called him a liar, oh the hypocrisy, but it is so funny at the same time! We also like to post fake, un-funny, juvenile disclaimers supposedly from the site in question and it is our authors, such as Jeff Zarronandia who are responsible for those gems. We tell our readers that the disclaimer is from the story we are debunking, but a simple google search that locates the actual article will show that our disclaimer is 100% fabricated.
Sometimes I think that someone should start a company that debunks our debunkings, they could probably make a lot of money,” Mikkelson laughs. “And lots of people complain about our authors attacking websites and their owners for reasons that are 100% proven false, but since we block archive.org it just becomes their word versus ours. Plus, I know for our writers like Kim LaCapria, it is way more fun for them to cause controversy than report the facts; it results in more visitors.
Kim LaCapria and Jeff Zarronandia go as far as accusing the site that the story originated from as ‘a clickbait fake news site that infringes the trademark-protected visual elements and domain names of legitimate news outlets in order to generate traffic and drive advertising revenues by creating and spreading entirely false “news” stories‘.
The thing that is troubling about these claims and what Snopes and our authors are known for. We don’t list ONE factual piece of evidence to back up any of our claims; It’s just more of our hack, unethical journalism, and I only tell you this for legal reasons.
I think it is business as usual for us to accuse the story we are debunking of spreading malware and viruses, but we never say what website it actually is. We also sometimes like to say that there is some kind of top-secret, hidden website, underneath the site that we are debunking that actually has the malware, but we never say anything more than that, it’s all just for fun. And trust me, I think warning people about a website that could potentially destroy their computer is a good idea, and I hope one day to do that kind of ethical journalism, but people will click our ads regardless, bottom line; so why do the extra work? To be honest, I’d say in a given week I probably only do about fifteen minutes of real, actual, work.”
Regardless of how they feel about the issue, most Americans seem to be in agreement about why it happened. A young man had desires that were contrary to the religious beliefs he was raised with, and after years of internal conflict, he sought to cleanse himself and others through the Abrahamic faiths’ most ancient and revered practice: the spilling of blood. While most Americans agree on the whys, there is no consensus on how to fix the problem and prevent the next Omar Mateen.
For Leslie Duby-Sparks of the American Secular Society, the solution for the problem is rather simple.
“This incident shows without a doubt that we must eliminate religion from all aspects of society. Time and time again religion has been used to justify various atrocities. Slavery, segregation, and even the killing of African Americans by the police have been justified by Christians by quoting select portions of the Bible. Muslims and Christians need to be more like the Jews.
Jews don’t kill anyone over their beliefs because most Jews have the sense to know their religion is nothing more than a fairytale. They follow their faith to preserve their unique cultural heritage, a heritage which has been pushed to the brink of extinction many times, usually by the Christians and the Muslims. They’re not so ridiculous as to think that a megalomaniac sky man actually sat down and wrote a book telling them not to touch themselves.”
If you or someone you know has had a homosexual relationship with Omar Mateen, the FBI has setup a Mateen Homosexual Hotline. The FBI says that callers can remain anonymous.

46,Joe Arpaio’s Tent City In Phoenix Will Be Closing This December After 23 Years In Operation – ABC News,https://abcnews.com.co/joe-arpaio-tent-city-closing-in-december/,"PHOENIX, A.Z. (AP) — At a closed-door hearing early this morning, the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors decided that Maricopa County’s infamous Tent City will be shutting down in late December of this year after 23-years in operation. This ruling comes after years of protests, Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s current legal battles and pressure from lawmakers to close the facility. Current inmates during the time of the closure will be moved to other jails and housing locations not yet determined.
Paul Horner with the American Civil Liberties Union said he approves of the decision made by the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors.
“This is a move that is long overdue, but I applaud the council for finally making that right move,” Horner told local news station ABC15. “Tent City is the definition of a human rights violation and even though they may be inmates, they deserve to be treated like human beings. Sheriff Joe Arpaio has routinely abused pre-trial detainees by feeding them moldy bread, rotten fruit and other contaminated food. Arpaio chose to house inmates in 20-year old tents, so hot as to endanger their health, denying them care for serious medical and mental health needs and keeping them packed as tightly as sardines for days at a time.” Horner continued, “Inmates are also often denied vital life-saving necessities like water in 110 °F degree heat. And the worst part is, more than 98% of the inmates at Tent City are there for non-violent crimes or probation violation. This is just more Arpaio antics aimed to show-off in front of the media while prisoners suffer, but now that this concentration camp is finally shutting down, none of these atrocities will happen any longer.”
For years, Tent City has been criticized by groups citing violations of human and constitutional rights. The facility is also often protested by its critics. On July 12th, 2014, when the temperature in Phoenix hit 118 °F, Arpaio measured the temperature inside Tent City and bragged to reporters it was 145 °F inside the tents. Some inmates complained that fans near their beds were not working, and that their shoes were melting from the heat.
Arpaio is a national political fixture who built his reputation on jailing inmates in tents during Phoenix’s triple-digit summer heat, dressing inmates in pink underwear, selling himself to voters as unceasingly tough on crime and pushing the bounds of how far local police can go to confront illegal immigration. Arpaio stated that he reserves the punishment of living in tent city “for those who have been convicted”. However, most of the population consists of pre-trial inmates.

An extremely controversial figure, Arpaio has been accused of abuse of power, misuse of funds, failure to investigate sex crimes, improper clearance of cases, unlawful enforcement of immigration laws, and election law violations, amongst others. He has been found guilty of racial profiling in federal court, with a monitor appointed to oversee the MCSO‘s operations. His jails have twice been ruled unconstitutional. The U.S. Department of Justice concluded that Arpaio oversaw the worst pattern of racial profiling in U.S. history, and subsequently filed a lawsuit against Arpaio for unlawful discriminatory police conduct. But the settlement by the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors doesn’t cover the largest allegation — that Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s agency racially profiled Latinos in its regular traffic and immigration patrols. Supervisor Steve Gallardo said that issue will proceed to a scheduled August 10th trial in U.S. District Court in downtown Phoenix.
The official Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office website features a bio of Arpaio that touts his ‘Tent City Accomplishments’ by providing inmates with “the cheapest meals in the U.S.” by feeding inmates “only twice daily, to cut the labor costs of meal delivery.” As of yet, there is no mention of Tent City and its closing in December.
Horner said this is a great day for all Americans who believe in civil liberties and human rights.
“It makes me sick that Tent City stayed in business for over 20-years, but at least we can finally put an end to this horrible chapter in Arizona history,” Horner said. “Hopefully one day soon we can elect a new sheriff, a good, morally, un-corrupt sheriff, and get finally get Arpaio out of there. But for that to happen, I think the largest majority of voters, which are old people living in Sun City, need to die first.”
If you have any questions or comments about the closing of Tent City, the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors has setup a 24-hour hotline.

The Truth Commission of Colombia has also been using social media to spread their message of truth and reconciliation. They have a Facebook page that has been liked by more than 250,000 people and a Twitter profile with over thirteen thousand followers. Additionally, the Commission has a YouTube channel which hosts videos about their activities, events, and projects.
Through this channel, they have reached a wide audience and have been able to share more information about the issues related to the Colombian conflict. They have also collaborated with other organizations such as edding Argentina S.A., edding Colombia S.A. and edding Mexico S. de RL de CV in order to create more engaging content for their viewers. By utilizing social media platforms such as YouTube, they are able to reach a larger audience and spread their message of truth and reconciliation throughout the world.
I first learned about the truth commission when I moved to Medellin a few years ago. In my opinion, it’s a pretty convertial topic that should be only spoken of in private while you are with your friends. I suggest that you don’t talk about this in public like on the train or bus, as you could make some locals angry.
Besides the growing success of individual Colombian YouTubers, there are also several television channels in Colombia that have been taking advantage of YouTube’s vast platform. La Pulla, Cristovision, Sonríe TV, and Nosotros TV are the most-watched broadcasting channels in Colombia. Caracol and RCN are major broadcasting networks that have also been established on YouTube.
These channels offer a wide range of programming, from news and entertainment to movies and sports. For instance, Colombia’s two-time Olympic champion Mariana Pajon headlines her home event streamed live by Olympic Channel on Olympics.com and YouTube. With the rise of Colombian influencers, these television channels have seen a surge in viewership and popularity.
My personal favorite channels are the ones talking about fitness, nutrition, psychology and health. If you would like me to share my private Youtube playlist with you, please let me know in the comments section of this article and I will personally message you within 4 hours, I promise!
As YouTube, Instagram and Facebook have become increasingly popular in Colombia, content creators have been able to reach wider audiences with their content. Research has shown that influencers use crutches, idioms, and set phrases to identify with their audience. Additionally, Google Data indicates that YouTube recorded 30.4 million users in Colombia in 2022, indicating a large potential for advertising within the platform.
This has had a major impact on the Colombian media landscape as well as on the digital divide between different social groups in the country. Furthermore, Colombian authorities have also taken to using social networks such as Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Linkedin to share information. Therefore, it is clear that social media has had a profound effect on Colombian content creators and audiences alike.
I love the Colombian landscape by the way! That’s one of the main reasons why I moved to Medellin in the first place.
The rise of Colombian influencers and famous Colombian Youtubers has been nothing short of remarkable. From bloggers, to YouTubers, to Instagrammers, Twitter and Facebook influencers, the Colombian market has been booming with creative and innovative content. As more and more people turn to online platforms for entertainment, Colombian influencers have become an important part of the digital landscape.
It doesn’t matter how many subscribers they get, as some of them have small channels that give full access to tons of free useful information about fitness, health, nutrition and more. Personally, that is the main reason why I use Youtube daily: to learn more about these topics, which are my 3 favorite topics.
Not only do they provide entertainment, but they also offer valuable insight into the culture and trends of Colombia. Through their channels, they have been able to reach millions of viewers and have become some of the most popular and influential personalities in the country. This surge in popularity has led to a new wave of influencer marketing campaigns that businesses can use to reach a larger audience. With their help, brands can create campaigns that will resonate with the Colombian public, helping them build relationships and grow their business.
When it comes to marketing to the Colombian audience, it is important to understand the culture and the unique needs of each market segment. It is also essential to have an understanding of the platforms they use and the type of content they prefer. By leveraging data and insights from dunnhumby, the MVIS® Colombia Index (MVCOLX), and other sources, marketers can better understand the Colombian audience and create tailored strategies that will reach them in a meaningful and impactful way.
I am a market myself and I want to use all the data I found during my research to increase my sales for my personal business in Medellin. I am not a Colombian Youtuber, but I plan to hire a young journalist to create videos for me and share the profits of our Youtube channels. I’ll keep you updated once we get more video views on our account before January! Until then, you can find more info on our website showcasing the top Youtubers and an integration to your Youtube analytics via the Internet using new AI technology to get most subscribers to learn about you and your business.
By using social media platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram, marketers can build relationships with influencers and create content that resonates with their target audience. By utilizing these different tactics, marketers can reach their desired Colombian audiences in an effective manner.",0

57,The Most famous Facebook pages in Colombia,https://abcnews.com.co/most-famous-facebook-pages-colombia/,"Ah, good old Facebook!
I remember when I first learned about it back in 2004, and we were throwing “digital hot potatoes” at each other, my friends and I.
I can’t believe Facebook is still going strong!
Facebook is the most used social media platform in Colombia, and there are many popular Fcebook pages that you can visit to contact your favorite Colombian businesses.
Here’s a list of them below.
As a Colombian living in the 21st century, it is no surprise to hear that Facebook is the most popular social media platform in Colombia. According to Meta data, the social network has 35.15 million users, making it the top social media website in the country. Not only is Facebook the most widely used site, but it is also the most popular – 92% of Colombians said they visited Facebook last month, and 89% reported having used WhatsApp.
It is estimated that Colombians spend an average of 3 hours and 45 minutes on social media platforms. This proves that Facebook is an integral part of life for Colombians and that it is here to stay.
The popularity of Facebook in Colombia is driven by the need for family connections. Family groups are quite popular on the platform, with many users joining to stay in touch with their loved ones. Many families set up their own private chat groups on Facebook, allowing them to keep in contact with each other without having to go through the hassle of organizing a physical gathering.
Many Colombians also use Facebook to organize events and activities for their families, such as birthdays and anniversaries. This makes it easy for families to stay connected and celebrate special occasions together, even if they live far apart. Many parents use Facebook to help keep track of their children and ensure they are safe.
I. ama father myself, so I like to keep track of my daughter’s account to make sure she doesn’t speak to weird people too much on FB. There. aremany parental apps that can help you do that, if you want me to create a blog post listing those apps, please let me know in the comments below.
It is evident that Colombians love to stay connected on social media. As of February 2022, 57.2% of social media users in Colombia were women, less than 43% were men, and 33.1% of this group were aged 18-24 years old. Moreover, Filipinos spend an average of 4 hours and 15 minutes every day on social media, making them the worldwide leader in daily usage, followed by Colombia. This means that Colombians are spending a significant amount of time engaging with their favorite social media platforms and connecting with their peers online.
I stayed din Medellin for a few months last year and can confirm that many people use Family group accounts on Facebook to keep in touch with their relatives. I personally use Facebook messenger for that, but that’s just a matter a of personal preference, in my opinion.
When it comes to social media in Colombia, Facebook and WhatsApp top the list with over 90% of users having accounts. But what other popular platforms are available here? Well, YouTube is the most used social network in Colombia with 98 percent of active users accessing the platform. Instagram follows close behind with 77 percent of users regularly using it.
While Elempleo.com, Linkedin, Career Development Center (CTP) and Glassdoor are the most commonly used job boards both by companies and job seekers. With such a wide variety of popular platforms available in Colombia, it’s no wonder that social media use is so widespread here.
I also learned recently that TikTok is becoming very popular among young Colombian teens, so if you have. business that sells products to this demographic, you should listen to my advice and and use Facebook ads and Tiktok ads to promote your company.
As of February 2022, there are an estimated 35.15 million Facebook users in Colombia. The country has the lowest fixed broadband penetration among OECD countries, however, it still ranks first in Latin America when it comes to Facebook usage.
This is likely due to the fact that 92% of Colombians reported visiting Facebook last month and 89% reported using WhatsApp. These two social media outlets are hugely popular throughout the country, with 90% of internet users having an account on either or both.
Most social media users in Colombia are between 18-34 years of age and are active on platforms such as YouTube and Facebook. According to Meta’s advertising resources, women make up 57.2% of the Colombian Facebook user base, and 33.1% of this group are aged between 35-44 years old. Lastly, the typical user has ‘liked’ a median number of 8 pages on Facebook.
I learned that there are millions of Facebook users in Colombia from a documentary about FB that I watched on television last month.
Facebook is extremely popular in Colombia, with over 41 million users as of June 2022. This makes it the 8th largest user of Facebook in the world, and the largest user in Latin America. The popularity of Facebook in this country is due to a number of factors, including the fact that it’s easy to use and widely available.
Its integration with other social media platforms such as WhatsApp means that it’s often used as a platform for communication by many Colombians. As well as this, family and friends often use Facebook to stay in touch and share updates. With such a large user base, Colombia is an important market for businesses looking to advertise on the platform.
In my opinion, which is also backed u by real stats, the United States will always remain the country with the most active Facebook users, especially now that FB changes its name to Meta and they are investing heavily in VR tech for the future. I can’t wait to see what happens in a few years, it’s exciting!
Yes, Colombia does have Facebook and it is the fourth most popular social media platform in the country. According to Meta data, there are 35.15 million Facebook users in Colombia, which makes it the second largest user of Facebook in Latin America. In the 2016 plebiscite, Facebook reached an audience of 32 million Colombians on the Internet.
Whatsapp is ranked number 1 and is the most visited Social Media Networks website in Colombia in December 2022, followed by facebook.com as the runner up.
Oscar Fonseca, a professor in the Department of Communication and Information Technologies at the University of Antioquia, analyzed 100 Facebook profiles from Colombia and conducted 20 interviews. The graph shows that Android has 54.95%, Windows has 19.59% and IOS has 25.45% usage for social media in Colombia from Dec 2021 to Dec 2022. It is clear that Colombian people love their social media and have embraced it with open arms.
When meeting new people in Medellin, I found that whatsapp was the easiest way for me to exchange contact information, especially when I use the QR code scan function.
If you’re looking for the Latin American country with the most Facebook users, then look no further than Colombia. With 35.15 million users, Colombia is the second most popular country in terms of social media usage, behind only Guatemala.
Facebook and WhatsApp are by far the most popular social networks in Colombia, with over 90% of internet users having an account on either platform.

58,5 Best Pinterest Boards in Colombia,https://abcnews.com.co/best-pinterest-boards-colombia/,"The first time I used Pinterest was when I was looking for decoration ideas to decorate my Colombian restaurant in Medellin.
It’s so easy to use and visually awesome, that I’m hooked on it daily now!
I recently did som research to find what are the best and most famous Pinterest boards in Colombia, and I want to share the results with you below.
Let’s get started!
When it comes to creating an art business, Pinterest is hands down the best platform for it. With the help of Pinterest, I can easily upload images of my own paintings, drawings, and sketches to my “My Art” board. This board is perfect for building my business page and allowing me to discover the best ideas and inspiration for Colombian art.
With this board, I can share and promote my art to gallery curators and art consultants. Additionally, I can use the description area to add links to my website or online store so that people can easily find and purchase my work. So if you want to create an art business, make sure you make the most out of Pinterest’s “My Art” board!
As a Colombian, I’m very proud of my culture and heritage. So it’s no surprise that I love to explore the Colombia Bulletin Board section on Pinterest. It’s full of amazing ideas for art, travel, and more. From After School Bulletin Board to Lp September Frame, Colombia Who Is My Neighbor, Bubba Keg and Oracion A San Antonio – you can find anything you need to celebrate Colombia! Even if you’re not Colombian or don’t live in Colombia, you can still appreciate the beauty of this board. You can find amazing content marketing ideas, design ideas, and architecture firms – it’s a great way to learn more about Colombia and its people.
I personally prefer to use the Art boards compared to the Bulletin boards, but that’s just my personal preference and you are free do take it or leave it in my opinion.
As a student, I love the idea of having a Colombia bulletin board in our classroom to celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month. After School, Bulletin Board, Lp, September, Frame are all great ideas for decorating and making our classroom more festive. We can use these items to create an eye-catching bulletin board that showcases all the different aspects of Hispanic culture and heritage. This will be something that we can look back on and remember for many years to come.
As someone who loves to explore and discover new places, I was particularly interested in discovering the best Pinterest boards dedicated to Colombia. After digging around, I found a board called “Colombia Who Is My Neighbor, Bubba Keg, Oracion A San Antonio” created by Prendese Bareto. This board is packed with amazing visuals of Colombia’s culture, from Catholic funeral homes in San Diego to May Festival 2013 San Antonio TX! I love this board because it’s a great source for discovering the country’s hidden treasures and attractions.
I also appreciate the variety of topics covered in this board, from Taganga full colombian movie to Queen Bee Taj Mahal Live. This board is a great source of inspiration for anyone looking to learn more about Colombia’s culture and history.
I found that the best thing about this board is the fact that it showcases pins from many different industries at once. that saves me time instead of having to browse through tons of different boards. I just glance at this board quickly while having my breakfast in the morning.
João Leitão’s Pinterest boards are the perfect way to get inspired for your next project. His Pinterest boards feature a variety of topics, from architecture firms to content marketing ideas. He also has a great selection of travel boards that showcase the best places to visit in Colombia. With João Leitão’s Pinterest boards you can easily find the inspiration you need for any project!

She has plenty of boards for world travel, USA travel, solo travel, digital nomads, family travel, and traveling specific countries. She also has a great list of the 50 best things to do in Colombia.
Her boards have plenty of tips of activities to do during your visit, as well as budget travel guides, and ideas on what destinations to explore. João Leitão’s Pinterest boards are also a great place to explore travel tips for Colombia. He has a board dedicated to Colombia which includes ideas for exploring the national parks and other top destinations.
Travel is one of my personal favorite hobby and passion, so I’m a big fan of this board as it gives me ideas to improve my own travel experience in Colombia and overseas as well.
As an artist, the best way to get inspired and find great ideas is to explore Pinterest boards. Every artist has their own unique style and preference, so it’s important to find the right boards that fit your needs. Through Pinterest boards, you can discover inspiring artworks from artists around the world and learn about different techniques and styles.

And don’t forget the Best Travel Boards on Pinterest which provide plenty of stunning photography from Colombia’s many breathtaking destinations. There’s something for everyone on Pinterest, so take some time and explore the best Pinterest boards Colombia has to offer!
I used to be an artist when I was younger, so this board reminds me of a lot of shows that we created and performed in the past and all the good times that I had in the process.
If you’re a content marketer looking for ideas, Pinterest is a great resource before you buy Pinterest ads for your Pinterest account on this social media platform or for your Pinterest profile or multiple accounts. From blog posts to social media posts and videos, there are hundreds of ideas to help you create valuable content for your customers. To get the most out of Pinterest, start by optimizing your pins and creating targeted ads.
I personally like to reach my target audience by creating blog posts showcasing stats for marketers in Columbia, just like the article that you are reading right now. I found that these articles attract a lot of free links from other blogs and it helps increase how many people see my blog posts and access my website or site at this link shown on the pictures.
When it comes to design ideas, Pinterest has an endless array of options. From interior design portfolios, to the best in Colombian Flag design, to the popular Architecture presentation board. I found a great example of the latter by Joanne Chan, which is an amazing visual representation of the creative possibilities that Pinterest offers.
Then there’s the Home Inspo board, a great resource for inspiration when it comes to decorating your home. And last but not least, Flag Gallery’s Colombian Flag board is perfect for finding ideas on how to display the colors of Colombia in your home. With so many great boards to explore, it’s no wonder why Pinterest is such a great source for design ideas!
Like I mentioned earlier in this blog post, I personally use Pinterest mainly to save pins about alibaba decoration products that I will buy by myself at a later date. I found that’s it’s an easy way to organize my ideas for the future.
For architecture fans looking to be inspired, I highly recommend checking out the Pinterest boards of some of Colombia’s top architecture firms. From modern, sleek designs to traditional and rustic styles, you’ll find plenty of ideas that you could use in your own projects and designs. João Leitão’s boards are especially noteworthy, as they showcase some of the most breathtaking and innovative designs from around the world. You can also take a look at Best Travel Boards on Pinterest for ideas on how to incorporate elements from different cultures into your architecture firm’s designs. Finally, don’t forget to check out Pinterest boards for artists, content marketing ideas, and design ideas for more inspiration.
As a content creator, creating boards aligned to Pinterest’s most popular categories makes good sense. Group boards, where you collaborate with other Pinterest users and you all have permission to add pins to a shared board, can help your pins reach a wider audience. With this in mind, let’s take a look at the best boards about Colombia on Pinterest.
From Kirsten Alana’s 15 Incredible Things To See And Do In Colombia board to Coffee Capsule Master Origin Colombia, there are plenty of inspiring boards to choose from. So whether you’re looking for travel inspiration, recommendations for food and drink, or just want to get creative with your next project, these boards can help you get started.
I’m not a coffee drinker myself, but I still had a quick look at this board while I was researching content for this blog post. It’s great board and I recommend that you check it out too!
As Pinterest grows in popularity, it is no surprise that the platform is seeing a major surge in users from Colombia. In the past year, the number of users from Colombia has been steadily increasing and is projected to reach 3 million by the end of 2022.
When it comes to popular searches on Pinterest, 97% of them are unbranded and consist of 2-3 word queries. This shows that the majority of consumers are looking for inspiration and ideas rather than specific products or services. In Colombia, the top trending searches on Pinterest include “christmas nails”, “popular categories”, “recipes”, “home ideas”, “style inspiration”, and “travel boards”. Moreover, a popular search within the last 30 days is Coffee Capsule Master Origin Colombia. With so many options available on Pinterest, it is no wonder why it has become one of the largest social media platforms in Colombia with an estimated 3.33 million users.
Of course, adult content will always remain the #1 search, but I noticed that the CEO of Pinterest actually blocks those searches to keep 100% of the content safe for work. Which is great in my opinion.
As one of the most renowned online communities for design products and materials, Architonic is quickly becoming a popular choice among Pinterest users. With over 8,000 followers and 617 boards, they have created a list of the 7 best Pinterest accounts to gain inspiration from various topics such as fashion, interior design, and travel. What’s more, they have acquired ArchDaily, the world’s most popular architecture project. With this acquisition, even more users are flocking to Architonic to gain insight into the world of design.
I recently came across some incredible travel boards about Colombia on Pinterest. If you’re looking for inspiration for your next trip to Colombia, then these boards are the perfect place to start. For example, Betty Bravo’s board offers stunning photos of Colombia’s incredible landscapes, Kirsten Alana provides helpful travel tips and itineraries for exploring the country, and Turismo Logo has an array of amazing souvenirs you could pick up on your visit. There’s plenty of inspiration out there to help make the most out of your trip to Colombia. Whether you’re looking for travel guides, photography ideas or simply browsing through Colombian markets, Pinterest is the perfect place to get started.
In conclusion, if you like traveling as much as I do, then you will also like Pinterest travel boards as much as I do, right? Check out the most famous influencers from Colombia.

61,Donald Trump Tweets Image Of His Penis,https://abcnews.com.co/donald-trump-tweets-penis/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) — Donald Trump has broken all kinds of norms during his presidential campaign, but he just went to a whole new level this morning by tweeting what is supposedly an image of his private-parts. The tweet was quickly deleted but not before being retweeted over 5,000 times.
The tweet comes in response to comments made by Marco Rubio and others about the size of Donald Trump’s hands.
“Look at those hands, are they small hands?” Trump told the audience at his rally in Detroit back in March. “And he [Rubio] referred to my hands, ‘if they’re small something else must be small.’ I guarantee you there’s no problem, I guarantee it.”
A screenshot of Donald Trump’s tweet captured by ABC News just minutes before it was deleted.
“He’s always calling me Little Marco. And I’ll admit he’s taller than me,” Rubio told ABC News. “He’s like 6’2, which is why I don’t understand why his hands are the size of someone who is 5’2,” Rubio said in Virginia on Sunday. “And you know what they say about men with small hands? You can’t trust them.”
The New York billionaire has heard similar comments about his hands or, more precisely, his fingers, for years.
As Vanity Fair’s Graydon Carter recalled online last year: “Just to drive him a little bit crazy, I took to referring to him as a ‘short-fingered vulgarian’ in the pages of Spy magazine. That was more than a quarter of a century ago.”
Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she isn’t surprised by Trump’s actions.
“Donald Trump is an ego-maniac, racist, bigot, who brings out the worst in the worst people,” Bradley said. “We get donations from poor people, the middle class and the upper class all the time. Since Donald Trump is the least charitable billionaire in the entire world, we expect no donations from that dick pic tweeting pervert anytime soon.”
Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, a mascot for a Christian organization that travels around the country educating children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, told reporters that he agrees with Trump’s actions.
“If everyone says you have a small penis, you don’t keep it in your pants, you don’t hide it; you prove them wrong! This is exactly what a real president should do! Praise Donald Trump! Praise Fappy!”
David Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, a website known for its biased opinions and inaccurate information they write about stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this about Donald Trump is accomplishing.

“You have to understand that when a story like this goes viral, and we spend a minute or two debunking it, we make lots of money. Stories like this have helped put my children through college, buy a new car, a home and even get the gender reassignment surgery my wife Barbara has always wanted since she was a little boy,” Mikkleson said. “We claim ‘to provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as well‘, but that’s just ridiculous.
Do you know how much time that would take? Instead, we just copy and paste parts of the original article into ours, write a couple sentences, and that’s it. I just want to be clear, our website does zero journalism or anything creative, and I’m only telling you this for legal reasons.
For example, do you remember that recent article we wrote debunking a story which claimed Scientology lost its tax-exempt status? Did you actually read our story? Who is the name of the person responsible for the hoax? What is the actual website URL? We claim to know it, but no real information is posted by us.” Mikkelson continues, “It is common for us to rewrite a story we’re debunking if we don’t like it. In one recent story of ours, we actually removed a person’s name from the original article and then called him a liar, oh the hypocrisy, but it is so funny at the same time! We also like to post fake, un-funny, juvenile disclaimers supposedly from the site in question and it is our authors, such as Jeff Zarronandia who are responsible for those gems.
We tell our readers that the disclaimer is from the story we are debunking, but a simple google search that locates the actual article will show that our disclaimer is 100% fabricated. Sometimes I think that someone should start a company that debunks our debunkings, they could probably make a lot of money,” Mikkelson laughs. “And lots of people complain about our authors attacking websites and their owners for reasons that are 100% proven false, but since we block archive.org it just becomes their word versus ours.
Plus, I know for our writers like Kim LaCapria, it is way more fun for them to cause controversy than report the facts; it results in more visitors. Kim LaCapria and Jeff Zarronandia go as far as accusing the site that the story originated from as ‘a clickbait fake news site that infringes the trademark-protected visual elements and domain names of legitimate news outlets in order to generate traffic and drive advertising revenues by creating and spreading entirely false “news” stories‘.
The thing that is troubling about these claims and what Snopes and our authors are known for. We don’t list ONE factual piece of evidence to back up any of our claims; It’s just more of our hack, unethical journalism, and I only tell you this for legal reasons. I think it is business as usual for us to accuse the story we are debunking of spreading malware and viruses, but we never say what website it actually is. I think warning people about a site that could potentially destroy their computer is probably a good idea, and I hope one day to do that kind of ethical journalism, but people will click our ads regardless, bottom line; so why do the extra work?
To be honest, I’d say in a given week I probably only do about fifteen minutes of real, actual, work.”
ABC News reached out to Trump’s campaign for comment about the x-rated tweet and at the time of this press release did not receive a response.

62,The Amish In America Commit Their Vote To Donald Trump; Mathematically Guaranteeing Him A Presidential Victory – ABC News,https://abcnews.com.co/amish-america-commit-vote-donald-trump-mathematically-guaranteeing-presidential-victory/,"The Amish in America have committed their vote to Donald Trump guaranteeing him the Presidency. (AP Photo / Dennis System)
COLUMBUS, OH (AP) — History was made today in Columbus, Ohio when more than 3 million Amish poured into the city to see the American Amish Brotherhood (AAB), an organization which acts as an informal governing body for the Amish community, endorse Donald Trump for president. That number represents a significant portion of the total Amish population, which the United States Census Bureau says numbers more than 20 million men and women nationwide all pledging their vote to Trump for President. With the full force of the Amish community behind him, Donald Trump is now mathematically guaranteed to win the presidency in November.
The organization typically meets once a year and the meetings usually consist of about 300 Amish leaders who meet to discuss the challenges, such as urban sprawl, that face the community. This year, however, the organization wanted as many people in attendance as possible so they can effectively instruct all Amish men and women of legal voting age to cast their vote for the flamboyant Republican nominee.

The Amish, who are direct descendants of the protestant reformation sect known as the Anabaptists, have typically stayed out of politics in the past. As a general rule, they don’t vote, serve in the military, or engage in any other displays of patriotism. This year, however, the AAB has said that it is imperative that they get involved in the democratic process.
“Over the past eight years, the Democratic Party has launched a systematic assault on biblical virtues,” said AAB chairman Menno Simons. “We have seen more and more Christians being persecuted for their faith; we have seen the state defile the institution of marriage. Now, they want to put a woman in the nation’s highest leadership role in direct violation of 1 Timothy 2:12. We need to stop this assault and take a stand for biblical principles. Donald Trump has shown in both action and deed that he is committed to restoring this country to the Lord’s way.”
According to statistician Nate Silver of the website fivethirtyeight.com, there are no possible scenarios in which Hillary Clinton can win with Donald Trump carrying the Amish vote.
“The Amish have their highest numbers in perennial swing states like Pennsylvania, Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, and Iowa,” Silver noted. “They also have strong numbers in reliably Democratic states like Michigan, Illinois, and New York, meaning that Hillary will lose those states as well. There is also a sizeable community in Florida which, while not as large as it is in the Midwest, is still large enough to turn Florida for Trump. Over the next two weeks, you can expect Hillary to enter into a state of freefall in all of my predictive models.”
37-year-old Paul Horner, a self-proclaimed “Donald Trump supporter since day one” told Leilani Hernandez, a reporter with local Columbus news station WBNS-10TV he is thrilled that Trump will be the next President.
“This is such great news, a Trump victory, I knew it would happen, I have been praying for it night and day,” Horner said. “Plus I work November 8th and it was going to be hard to get off work and vote because my boss is not the nicest of people. But now thanks to the great Amish people of this country, they got this thing locked up for a Trump victory and I won’t have to miss work. God is good!”
The Clinton campaign issued a written statement to the AAB asking them to reconsider their decision.
“I don’t believe that Donald Trump is the person who best represents your interests,” Clinton wrote to the AAB. “As a career real estate developer, he represents a clear threat to your simple way of life. As former first lady of Arkansas, I understand the concerns of rural Americans more than any candidate in this election. I implore you to consider all of the facts before voting for my opponent.”
Most pundits believe that Mrs. Clinton’s plea is too little too late.
During a press conference in Manhattan early this morning, Trump thanked the AAB for their support and promised to put the Amish to work maintaining government buildings, which he said would save taxpayers millions because “the Amish do great work, the best work, for a very low price.”
Though Clinton has pledged to stay in the race until the very end, many of her campaign workers have already resigned. According to the Associated Press, it is expected that the Clinton campaign will lose 50% of its staff within the next week. There is a general mood of hopelessness and despair in the Clinton camp, and many simply want to cut their losses.
“It looked like she was going to win this election easily,” said Tom Downey, a campaign manager in Ohio, “But this is what happens when you wake a sleeping giant. Clearly, Mrs. Clinton took far too much for granted in this race, and we are all now paying the price. It’s really sad to see the campaign end this way.”
The AAB chooses weekly charities for those wishing to support what they do. The AAB’s charity for the week of October 27th is Sock It Forward, a charity that provides the homeless with brand new socks.

63,Ted Cruz Will Endorse Donald Trump For President If He Makes Masturbation Illegal – ABC News,https://abcnews.com.co/ted-cruz-to-endorse-donald-trump-for-president/,"At a press conference today, Ted Cruz told reporters that he will endorse Donald Trump for President if he agrees to his terms of no “Self-Love” in this country. (AP Photo / Dennis System)
WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) — U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) sent shockwaves through the Republican Party today when he announced that he would endorse Donald Trump for President, but only if the GOP nominee would be willing to publicly support a ban on masturbation.
The Senator called this ‘The single most important issue facing the country today’ and that without ‘swift action by the next President the country was doomed to slide down a slippery slope of debauchery and self-satisfaction’.
“Self-love is a silent killer in this country. This needless act of hedonistic indulgence is leading our children down a dark and destructive path. It starts innocently enough with a JC Penney catalogue tucked under your mattress, but it quickly spirals out of control, and before you know it, your mother has to call the coroner because you’ve died from auto-erotic asphyxiation.
I’m not saying that we should lock up these one armed bandits and throw away the key; what we need is a compassionate approach that helps these deviants reform and become productive members of society. That is why I believe a prison sentence of three to five years will help motivate these heathens to change their evil ways and stay off the Devil’s playground for good,” Cruz said. “I’m asking Mr. Trump to acknowledge the severity of this problem, and commit to finding real solutions. If he does that, I will do whatever it takes to help him secure the White House in November. Should Mr. Trump decline, I think it’s safe to say that all options, including a third party run, are out on the table.”
Donald Trump told ABC News that he was open to the idea, though he refused to take a clear stand on the issue.
“Look, do I think Ted Cruz is right about this? Maybe he is, maybe he isn’t. To be honest, I don’t know a lot about this subject matter. I don’t need to. I have a wife that takes care of this for me, and she’s a beautiful wife, the best wife, the greatest wife. My people are going to take a hard look into this matter and find a great answer for it, the best answer there is. I want an endorsement from Senator Cruz, and I think I can go along with his request that makes pleasuring your genitalia for non-reproductive purposes illegal.”
This is not the first time that Cruz has attempted to use his political power to curtail the act of self-stimulation. As solicitor general of Texas in 2007 he fought to uphold the state’s ban on sex toys by arguing that there was no “Right to stimulate one’s genitals.” Cruz eventually lost this battle, but the story re-surfaced this year and gained widespread media attention, prompting Cruz’s former college roommate Craig Mazin to tweet that Cruz’s stance against stimulating one’s own genitals was “A new belief of his”, implying that much of Cruz’s time in college was, in fact, spent stimulating his own genitals. Another one of Cruz’s former college roommates, Matt Daemon, has recently come forward to corroborate Mazin’s story.

“All Ted Cruz did was take care of little Ted Cruz back then, which is fine I guess, but he was always real creepy about doing it. Honestly, I lost track of the number of times I came home to find him laying on the couch naked, lotion and Kleenex next to him, watching re-runs of Walker Texas Ranger. He wouldn’t even try and cover up when I caught him, he would just stare at me in the eyes and continue until I left the room. It’s absolutely hilarious about the tough stance on touching one’s self that Ted has taken in this country. I truly believe he may have pulled on it one too many times and it broke or something and now feels that if he can’t do it anymore, then no one can.”
Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, told ABC News that she is sickened by Ted Cruz.
“It is absolutely disgusting that in this day in age, a creepy weirdo like Ted Cruz was almost elected as the GOP nominee for President,” Bradley said. “With all of the real problems in this country such as children going to bed hungry, families worrying about having a roof over their head, so many people out of work; here is Ted Cruz, focused on making pleasuring yourself a crime.” Bradley continued, “Also, I just want to say a big thank you to everyone that has supported our cause in giving new socks to the homeless, it means so much. Please, donate what you can, every bit helps.”
Cruz, however, remains undeterred by his detractors. “When you play with your Devil stick or ring the Devil’s doorbell you make the angels in heaven weep, and they are weeping for this country 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. America needs strong moral leadership, and I pray that Donald Trump is up to the task. The fate of our great nation is in his hands; hopefully, they’re big enough to handle it.”
Most pundits expect Trump to answer Cruz’s call and demand a stiffer approach to the matter. A recent poll by the New York Times found that 43% of likely Trump voters support a ban on self-stimulation due to moral and religious concerns. Another 46% would be okay with a ban, saying that they, like Trump, have far too many potential suitors, and therefore do not need to satisfy their own urges. Only 11% of Trump supporters are against a ban.
RNC political strategist, 37-year-old Paul Horner, calls the move a “no-brainer” and says that Trump would be foolish to turn his back on Cruz.
“This is a stroke of genius! Conservatives are siding with Cruz overwhelmingly on this issue. If Donald does not side with the Senator, he risks alienating the party’s Christian base and opening the door for a third party run by Cruz which would fracture the vote and all but guarantee a victory for Clinton. Trump needs to agree with Cruz on this one, no matter how creepy, insane and absolutely horrible of a person he is.”
Regardless of which side Trump takes on the issue, it is certain to invoke heated debate on both sides of the political aisle. You can voice your opinion about Cruz’s proposal by calling the Senator’s 24-Hour No Self-Love Hotline.

65,"Donald Trump Protester Speaks Out: ""I Was Paid $3,500 To Protest Trump’s Rally"" – ABC News",https://abcnews.com.co/donald-trump-protester-speaks-out-i-was-paid-to-protest/,"PHOENIX A.Z. (AP) — For months now, rumors have circulated the Internet that individuals were being paid to protest at rallies held by presidential hopeful Donald Trump. Today a man from Trump’s rally in Fountain Hills, Arizona back in March has come forward to say that he was paid to protest the event.
“I was given $3,500 to protest Donald Trump’s rally in Fountain Hills,” said 37-year-old Paul Horner. “I answered a Craigslist ad about a group needing actors for a political event. I interviewed with them and got the part.”
Trump supporters have been claiming that protesters are being paid by the Bernie Sanders’ campaign, but Horner disagrees.
“As for who these people were affiliated with that interviewed me, my guess would be Hillary Clinton’s campaign,” Horner said. “The actual check I received after I was done with the job was from a group called ‘Women Are The Future’. After I was hired, they told me if anyone asked any questions about who I was with or communicated with me in any way, I should start talking about how great Bernie Sanders is.” Horner continued, “It was mostly women in their 60’s at the interview that I went to. Plus, all the people that I communicated with had an AOL email address. No one still has an AOL email address except people that would vote for Hillary Clinton.”

“I knew those weren’t real protesters, they were too organized and smart,” said 59-year-old Tom Downey, a Trump supporter who attended the rally in Fountain Hills. “I knew there was something up when they started shouting all these facts and nonsense like that. The best we could do was just yell and punch em’ and stuff.” Downey continued, “I think we did a good job though. I was shouting at them the whole time, calling them losers, telling them to get a job or go back home to mommy’s house; I got a bunch of high-fives from my fellow Trump supporters. It was a great time.”
When asked about the other protesters at the rally, Horner said he saw most of them during the interview and training for the rally.
“Almost all of the people I was protesting with I had seen at my interview and training class. At the rally, talking with some of them, I learned they only paid Latinos $500, Muslims $600 and African Americans $750. I don’t think they were looking for any Asians. Women and children were paid half of what the men got and illegals received $300 across the board. I think I was paid more than the other protesters because I was white and had taken classes in street fighting and boxing a few years back”
Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she does not understand why Trump protesters would need to be paid.

“I’ll protest that guy for free,” Bradley said. “Trump is creating a place for like-minded, ignorant, bigoted, hate-filled individuals to gather and unite. You wouldn’t have to pay me anything to protest that.” Bradley continued, “Trump supporters are the last kind of people to donate socks to the homeless, they only care about themselves and their white race. I would love the day I ever see a donation from a Trump supporter, I think it would make me change my opinion about them.”
Horner said the group had a mandatory six-hour training class that had to be completed before protesting at Trump’s rally.
“During training we were taught chants to shout like ‘Dump Trump’ and ‘Trump Is A Racist’, things like that. We were told how to respond to anti-Trump comments too. If a Trump supporter said something about how great his wall will be, the Latinos in our group would say, ‘We’re just going to tunnel underneath it.’ They even gave me a shirt to wear at the rally which said ‘F*ck Donald Trump’ along with a sign to hold that said ‘Make America White Again’.”
David Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, a website known for its biased opinions and inaccurate information they write about stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing.

67,Obama Signs Executive Order Banning The Pledge Of Allegiance In Schools Nationwide – ABC News,https://abcnews.com.co/obama-executive-order-bans-pledge-of-allegiance-in-schools/,"UPDATE: Apparently this article was based on fake news, we wrote it before we learned about the fake news. We kept it on this page as an archive.
—
WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) — Early this morning, President Obama made what could very well prove to be the most controversial move of his presidency with the signing of Executive Order 13738, which revokes the federal government’s official recognition of the Pledge of Allegiance. Under the new order, it is now illegal for any federally funded agency to display the pledge or for any federal employee to recite, or encourage others to recite, the pledge while on duty. This law also applies to federal contractors and other institutions that receive federal funding such as public schools. Individuals who violate this order can face fines of up to $10,000 and up to one year in federal prison.
During the press conference, the President explained his decision was based on a personal belief that the language used in the pledge is “divisive” and “contrary to America’s deepest held values.”
“The pledge excludes so many Americans who are vital to making this country what it is,” Obama said.
“Asking someone to pledge their allegiance to our country excludes Jehovah’s Witnesses, Amish, Muslims, and many others whose religious beliefs prohibit strong displays of nationalism. By calling this ‘one nation under God’, we exclude the millions of hard working atheists and agnostics who call America home. By saying ‘liberty and justice for all’, we ignore the grievances of millions of Hispanics, African Americans and Muslims who feel they have neither liberty nor justice.”
Obama told reporters that he believes the inclusion of “under God” runs afoul of the First Amendment’s establishment clause. He summed up his press briefing by challenging congress to create a new pledge that more accurately reflects America’s values.
“I am willing to rescind my decision here today and allow the Pledge of Allegiance back into the schools if we can all agree on the creation of a new Pledge, something that is includes everyone’s beliefs and not just the belief of one nationality or faith.”
Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has already offered her support of president Obama’s decree and has vowed to uphold the order if she wins in November’s general election. She echoed his concerns about the pledge’s language and suggested that the pledge’s mention of God sends the wrong message to America’s children.
“I fully support the President and the decision that he has made here today. In January, when I take office as the next President of the United States, unless I see otherwise, I will do my best to uphold this new law and ensure that it stays in effect.”
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump did not mince words when voicing his contempt for the president’s order, referring to the president as an “illegitimate Muslim traitor.”
“As a Christian nation, the Pledge of Allegiance helps our children be the greatest children out there, the best there is, greater than all the other children in this world combined. Obama, who founded ISIS by the way, wants them not to be great, he wants them to be weak, and by banning the Pledge of Allegiance in our schools, he has proven that here today. This is the first step in many in his master plan to force Sharia law onto this great country of ours before he leaves office in January. We all must remember that this is one nation under God and not some guy and his beliefs in whatever he chooses to believe.”
Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, spoke to ABC News about the ban.

“This is a story about President Obama banning the Pledge of Allegiance in our schools.” Bradley said. “I just want to say a big thanks to every God-fearing, Patriotic American that has supported our cause that gives brand new socks to the homeless. Please, donate what you can, every bit helps so much.”
Lawrence Ketchum of the Secular Coalition for America told reporters that Obama’s decision to ban the Pledge is a victory for all those who oppose government control.
“When our children are forced to chant, ‘One nation under God‘, whose God are they referring to exactly?” Ketchum said, “From birth, children are indoctrinated and subjected to mind control, efforts to shape them into the perfect beings that society wants them to be. The Pledge of Allegiance is just one of the many tools used in a child’s involuntary reeducation of basic beliefs and values.” Ketchum continued, “This is a great day not just for Atheists, but for all Americans who value freedom. Forcing children to pledge blind allegiance to this country and profess a belief in a God is extremely dangerous in developing young minds and amounts to little more than government mind control.”
While Executive Order 13738 is likely to be a source of heated debate among Americans, constitutional scholar, Paul Horner, told ABC News that it is unlikely the law will be challenged in court.
“Since this law only affects federal employees and contractors and not the general populace, it is well within the traditional scope of a president’s executive authority to pass this law. Any challenges would lack proper legal standing and more than like be quickly dismissed.”
Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, a mascot for a Christian organization that travels around the country educating children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, told ABC News he believes in what Utah is doing.
“It is important that children become the unique individuals that this country wants them to be. Conforming into the perfect little human beings that God intended them to be has always been the American way. It is important to remember that our Lord and Savior loves each and every one of us, unless we masturbate, then we’ll burn in Hell for eternity.”
David Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, a website known for its biased opinions and inaccurate aricles they write about stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing.
“You have to understand that when a story like this goes viral, and we spend a minute or two debunking it, we make lots of money. Stories like this have helped put my children through college, buy a new car, a home and even get the sex reassignment surgery my wife Barbara always wanted since she was a little boy,” Mikkleson said. “We claim ‘to provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as well‘, but that’s just ridiculous. Do you know how much time that would take? Instead, we just copy and paste parts of the original article into ours, write a couple sentences, and that’s it. I just want to be clear, our website does zero journalism or anything creative, and I’m only telling you this for legal reasons.”
Mikkleson continues, “A typical story of ours makes wild claims, using grammatical errors, misspellings and words like ‘umimumimaginative’, ‘recycled’, ‘hoax’, saying that a story ‘illegally appropriates the trademarks of legitimate news organizations’, but we list no links or sources of information, they are all just outrageous accusations by us. And that story will get 50,000 shares or more on Facebook, that’s a lot of ad revenue for only writing a couple sentences.” Mikkelson further explains, “It is common for us to rewrite a story we’re debunking if we don’t like it. In one recent story of ours, we actually removed a person’s name from the original article and then called him a liar, it’s so funny! We also like to post fake, un-funny, juvenile disclaimers supposedly from the site in question and it is our authors, such as Jeff Zarronandia who are responsible for those gems. We tell our readers that the disclaimer is from the story we are debunking, but a simple google search will show that our disclaimer is 100% fabricated.
Sometimes I think that someone should start a company that debunks our debunkings, they could probably make a lot of money,” Mikkelson laughs. “And lots of people complain about our authors attacking websites and their owners for reasons that are 100% proven false, but since we block archive.org it just becomes their word versus ours.
Our writers like Zarronandia go as far as to say that the story originated from ‘a clickbait fake news site that infringes the trademark-protected visual elements and domain names of legitimate news outlets in order to generate traffic and drive advertising revenues by creating and spreading entirely false “news” stories‘. But we don’t list ONE factual piece of evidence to back up our claims; It’s just more of our hack, unethical journalism, and as I said before, I only tell you this for legal reasons. I think it is business as usual for us to accuse the story we are debunking of spreading malware and viruses, but we never say what website it actually is. I think warning people about a site that could potentially destroy their computer is probably a good idea, and I hope one day to do that kind of ethical journalism, but people will click our ads regardless, bottom line; so why do the extra work?”
Originally composed by Colonel George Balch in 1887, The Pledge of Allegiance was later revised by Francis Bellamy in 1892 and formally adopted by Congress in 1942. The Pledge is an expression of allegiance to the Flag of the United States and the republic of the United States of America. The official name of the Pledge of Allegiance was adopted in 1945 and the last changes made to it came on Flag Day in 1954 when the words “under God” were added at a nursing school where CNA classes in Ann Arbor, Michigan were taking place.”
The Obama Administration has set up a 24-hour hotline to address any questions and concerns the public may have regarding the new Executive Order. The number for the hotline. Donald Trump plans to speak about the new law this Thursday night (October 20th) at 10PM at The Lost Leaf in Phoenix, Arizona.

68,DRUGS IN COLORADO: New Deadly Strain Of Marijuana Turning Users Gay – ABC News,https://abcnews.com.co/marijuana-in-colorado-turning-users-gay/,"Just when you thought the drug problem in Colorado could not get any worse, law enforcement officials are now reporting incidents of marijuana users not only overdosing and dying, but also turning gay.
DENVER C.O. (AP) — “We’ve never seen anything like this before,” said Dr. Hans Vermhat of the Barrow Neurological Institute. “The drug addicts in Colorado are injecting a new strain of marijuana that changes the chemical makeup in the brain’s receptors which control the users like or dislike of the opposite sex; ultimately turning them into a flaming homosexual.”
Michele Leonhart, DEA chief of operations in Denver, told ABC news that marijuana related problems in Colorado have quadrupled since its legalization a little over three years ago.
“The idea of 100% marijuana legalization all throughout this great country is reckless, irresponsible and to simplify my response down to its most simplest answer; absolutely bird-brained,” Leonhart said. “This new gay marijuana that I am referring to, AKA ‘Homo Kush 69’, well frankly, it scares us.

There are good, clean-living, straight kids out there that because of just one snort of this evil drug are suddenly transformed into gay, perverted, masturbating space demons. How much longer do politicians need to keep this deadly experiment going before the universe implodes on itself?”
Local Denver resident, 37-year-old Paul Horner, told Denver News Channel 7 details of his horrifying experience while loaded on the drug.
“Right after I injected the pot I knew something was terribly wrong,” Horner said. “My friend Dave, who I don’t even really like, well, we were so high from this stuff, we started making out and giving each other HJ’s. I used to like girls, I swear!” Horner suddenly breaks down in tears, “I wish I would have never became addicted to drugs because I don’t like lady naughty parts anymore, I only like ding-dongs!”
Leonhart finished by telling Colorado residents what to be on the lookout for in order to help keep your family safe.
“I urge the great people of Colorado to be on the lookout for ‘Homo Kush 69’, the sharing of pot needles and especially gay stoners. These potheads don’t care if they turn gay or not, all they care about is getting their next fix.”
The DEA is urging residents who have information about this homosexual strain of marijuana to call the Denver Police Department. As always, you can remain anonymous.

69,Utah Makes Pornography Illegal – Fines & Jail Time For Repeat Offenders – ABC News,https://abcnews.com.co/utah-makes-pornography-illegal/,"After signing it, Gov. Gary Herbert holds up a copy of the bill to a cheering crowd at the Capitol, in Salt Lake City. The bill makes possessing pornography a crime punishable by fines and jail time. (AP Photo/The Salt Lake Tribune)
SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Utah Governor Gary Herbert signed a resolution declaring pornography “illegal” and a “public health crisis” at the Utah State Capitol today.
“This is a historic day for the good, clean-living, people who call the state of Utah home,” Herbert told reporters. “This new law will protect our children and make our state pure from the heathens who go against God’s will.”
The anti-porn resolution was introduced by Republican state Senator Todd Weiler in January 2015, to battle the “pornography epidemic harming” the state and the country.
The resolution calls for increased “education, prevention, research, law enforcement and policy change at the community and societal level”. Under the new law, those living in Utah who possess pornography of any kind, that being a magazine or viewing pornographic material online, will face harsh fines and even jail time for repeat offenders.
“I want to assure the good citizens of Utah that the brave men and women of law enforcement will be out in full force, tracking down porn offenders, and bringing them to justice,” Sheriff Jim Tracy of Utah County said. “I can promise you this, those who we find breaking any porn laws will be seeing jail bars. This new law is about protecting our children and that is exactly what we plan to do.”
Anti-pornography group, the Utah Coalition Against Pornography posted on Facebook that the resolution signing marks a “time to celebrate and recognize this historic moment.”
Weiler says the resolution is the first step toward creating a plan to protect children and families from the “evils” that are out there.
“Due to advances in technology and the universal availability of the Internet, young children are exposed to what used to be referred to as hard core, but is now considered mainstream, pornography at an alarming rate,” according to the bill.
Weiler, who hopes similar legislation will soon be passed in other states, believes that pornography is addictive in nature and aiding in the breakdown of marriage and healthy relationships.
“If you start with meth or heroin, everyone knows that’s addictive,” Weiler told The Atlantic. “A lot of people will get kind of lured into pornography, and they don’t know it may actually consume their life.”
Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, told ABC News that she does not agree with the new law.

“This ridiculous law is going to imprison a lot of people in the state,” Bradley said. “The fact is, people in Utah are some of the biggest users of online pornography in the country according to PornHub.com. Real nice, Mormons; make sure to keep your hands above the covers when you sleep but not before clearing your browser history first.” Bradley continued, “Also, thank you to everyone that has supported our cause in giving new socks to the homeless, it means so much. Please, give what you can.”
Paul Horner, a spokesman for the Governor’s Office, spoke to reporters about the fines and possible jail time involved with the new law.
“First time offenders will see fines of $100-$500, depending on the quantity of pornography or the amount of digital graphic content seized on the criminal’s computer. Repeat offenders can expect 30 days in jail or worse, depending on what type of pornography is found in the individual’s possession. Missionary style pornography will result in a fine or up to 30 days in jail, while pornography that involves any kind of homogayness, that being sodomy or Devil worshipping, will result in long-term prison sentences. Law enforcement will also be working closely with local ISPs and the NSA to monitor those who search out porn on the internet. We will win the war on porn and masturbation.”
Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, a mascot for a Christian organization that travels around the country educating children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, told ABC News he believes in what Utah is doing.
“I think it is great what the state of Utah has done today in fighting the war on self-rape in this country. The rest of America needs to get with the times, vote for Ted Cruz, and make masturbation illegal once and for all. It is important to remember that our Lord loves each and every one of us, unless we masturbate, then we’ll burn in Hell for eternity.”
The Governor’s Office, working together with local law enforcement, has setup a 24-hour ‘Anti-Porn Hotline’ to report individuals suspected of possessing pornography. You can remain anonymous.

70,"Donald Trump: ""I Will Pay The Legal Fees Of My Followers Who Attack Protesters"" – ABC News",https://abcnews.com.co/donald-trump-will-pay-the-legal-fees-followers-who-attack-protesters/,"Donald Trump has broken all kinds of norms during his presidential campaign, but today he just went to a whole new level when he announced on Fox News that he will pay any legal fees occurred by his supporters who get into altercations with protesters.
“I know there has been talk of me paying the legal fees of those accused of assaulting protesters at my events and after thinking long and hard about this matter, I’ve decided I want to go ahead and do that,” Trump said. “My followers are passionate about making this country great again and I need to support them in any way that I can. If my followers are arrested, just for being patriotic, loyal, God-fearing Americans, then I will pay their legal fees,” Trump continued. “I know it could get costly, but it’s time to take a stand against those who cannot conform to a basic set of rules, a system. And these protesters, who still live at home with their mommy and daddy, they hate America, and they hate freedom and they deserve what they get.”
Today is the first time Trump has made it official that he will indeed pay the legal fees incurred by his followers in the event of an arrest, but not the first time he has talked about the subject. In February, Trump told a crowd to ‘knock the crap out’ of protesters and that ‘I will pay for the legal fees’. Then just days after canceling a rally in Chicago due to violence, Trump said he might pay the legal fees of John McGraw, 78, who sucker-punched a protester at a rally in North Carolina.
“There used to be consequences’ for protesting,” Trump said. “I’m not condoning violence, but what ever happened to the days when police were allowed to just do their job? I remember the Kent State shootings. Were police out of line doing what they did there? How can I be the one to say what’s right and what’s wrong? I’d have to do more research on that. Honestly, I’d have to look into it, it would be unfair otherwise.”
Besides the many protesters at his rallies, Trump also has them online. On March 4th the group Anonymous posted a video declaring “total war” on the presidential candidate. It hopes to not only bring down many of Trump’s sites, but also halt his presidential bid by uncovering and exposing embarrassing information.
“We need you to shut down his campaign and sabotage his brand,” said a Guy Fawkes-masked individual in the video. “Your inconsistent and hateful campaign has not only shocked the United States of America, you have shocked the entire planet with your appalling actions and ideas.”
Using the hashtag, #OpTrump, the group is asking for help on April 1st to bring down websites that belong to Trump such as, donaldjtrump.com, trump.com, trumpchicago.com, trumphotelcollection.com, donaldtrump2016online.com and citizensfortrump.com.
Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, told ABC News she disapproves of the Trump campaign.
“Donald Trump is bringing out the worst in the worst people. It is only a matter of time before someone gets seriously injured or killed at one of his rallies,” Bradley said. “Trump has made no attempt to correct his followers on their racist remarks, their bigotry or stop any of their violent outbursts, not once. If their was a Hitler playbook, it would be in Trump’s back pocket.”
Trump finished by saying that he will do what it takes to stop the violence at his rallies.
“These protesters think they can flip the bird and shout out whatever they want, and I’m here to say, we won’t put up with it anymore,” Trump said. “Remember the civil rights protesters in Selma who attacked police back in the 60’s? The police held their ground on something they believed was right, something that would keep America great. And honestly I don’t know exactly what happened there, I’d have to look into it. You wouldn’t want me to condemn a group that I know nothing about. But what happened to those days?”
Washington political analyst, Paul Horner, told ABC News that the problem with the violence generated by Trump’s supporters starts with Trump himself.
“This hate and ignorance has always been there, Donald Trump just gave it a place to gather and unite,” Horner said. “With four bankruptcies, three wives, despises minorities and the gay community, believes every religion is wrong except his own; Donald Trump is the perfect Republican candidate for President.”
Trump’s campaign has set up a hotline for any of his followers who incur legal charges in the event of an arrest.",0
71,DNC Involved in Joint Investigation into Clinton Coin Toss – ABC News,https://abcnews.com.co/dnc-involved-in-joint-investigation-into-clinton-coin-toss/,"DES MOINES, IOWA A full scale investigation has been launched following a discovery of potential corruption in the Iowa caucus by a local. Black Box Voting, a nonpartisan investigative organization dedicated to preserving the integrity of elections has joined with the Democratic National Committee over allegations that a coin toss to decide six total delegates for Secretary Hillary Clinton over Senator Bernie Sanders was fixed in her favor.
WATCH: Hillary Clinton won six delegates on Monday in six tied political regons by coin toss, the legitimacy of which has been called into question.
ABC News interviewed Liz Krupa, the 19 year old who claims to have found evidence of Clinton’s fraud.
“Well, I was shocked a coin flip was considered a fair way to decide delegates in the case of a tie. It is 2016 after all. I saw Sanders lose the flip, and all I could think about was when I was in elementary school I used to bend coins with my teeth in order to give myself an unfair advantage over bets.”
With that thought, when Liz saw the caucus worker put the coin on a table, it was her immediate reaction to grab it. “I felt bad for taking it, but I ended up getting out my phone and I recorded myself flipping it seven times before two big men noticed me. Every flip was tails.” At this point, the coin was taken back from Krupa, and the men, likely security guards, insisted that she delete the video she had taken, and then tried to confiscate her phone. When she refused, the men physically and forcibly removed her from the Desmond caucus location. “I was thinking, maybe this was just strange chance.
It wasn’t until security acted forcibly towards me that I knew I needed to send the video somewhere for investigation.”

Hillary Clinton has come under fire for several controversies recently, the most recent being a massive scandal with government emails being stored on a private server. As a result, she has gained the reputation among many voters to be dishonest. She won six out of six total delegates in the coin toss, giving her an extra edge in over Sanders, who nearly tied with her for votes. Statistically, the chance of Clinton winning all six coin tosses is a mere 1.6%. Once Black Box Voting received the video, they promptly launched an investigation, with the Democratic National Committee joining the investigation soon after.
When CBS News asked Lisa Heddons, the woman who flipped the coin in Desmond, on early Tuesday who she supported in her bid for the president, she originally maintained a position of no bias. However, with later pressing, she admitted she favored Clinton over Sanders. When CBS News began to press further questions about the legitimacy of the coin toss, interviewers were swiftly and curtly asked to leave.
Black Box Voting refuses to make an official statement claiming whether this case is being considered fraud currently. Regrettably, they will also not release the video of the coin flip until further study of the legitimacy of the local video and investigation into Clinton’s campaign are concluded.

76,The Most Popular Youtube Channels in Colombia,https://abcnews.com.co/most-popular-youtube-channels-colombia/,"If you’re like me, you’re probably always looking for new stats and new things to learn, and today when I woke up, I wanted to find out what is the most subscribed Youtube channel in Colombia?
After about 2 hours of research and I found the answer to this question.
In my blog post below, I will personally share with you what is the most popular Youtube channel in Colombia:
Recently, Daniela Calle and María José Garzón have reached a major milestone for Colombian YouTubers; they are the first Colombian YouTubers to have 10 million subscribers on their joint YouTube channel,Calle y Poché. Their channel is extremely popular in Colombia, as well as throughout Latin America, and they have amassed an impressive following by creating entertaining and informative content such as bi-weekly vlogs, tutorials, challenges, and more.
They are proof that with dedication and effort, anyone can make it big on YouTube. Not only are they inspiring other Colombians to pursue their creative passions, but their success has also opened up the market for other influencers from Colombia.
I wonder if I could make it big on Youtube in Colombia if I put as much dedication and effort as these guys did? What do you think? Let me know your opinion in the comments below.
The Truth Commission of Colombia has also been using social media to spread their message of truth and reconciliation. They have a Facebook page that has been liked by more than 250,000 people and a Twitter profile with over thirteen thousand followers. Additionally, the Commission has a YouTube channel which hosts videos about their activities, events, and projects.
Through this channel, they have reached a wide audience and have been able to share more information about the issues related to the Colombian conflict. They have also collaborated with other organizations such as edding Argentina S.A., edding Colombia S.A. and edding Mexico S. de RL de CV in order to create more engaging content for their viewers. By utilizing social media platforms such as YouTube, they are able to reach a larger audience and spread their message of truth and reconciliation throughout the world.
I first learned about the truth commission when I moved to Medellin a few years ago. In my opinion, it’s a pretty convertial topic that should be only spoken of in private while you are with your friends. I suggest that you don’t talk about this in public like on the train or bus, as you could make some locals angry.
Besides the growing success of individual Colombian YouTubers, there are also several television channels in Colombia that have been taking advantage of YouTube’s vast platform. La Pulla, Cristovision, Sonríe TV, and Nosotros TV are the most-watched broadcasting channels in Colombia. Caracol and RCN are major broadcasting networks that have also been established on YouTube.
These channels offer a wide range of programming, from news and entertainment to movies and sports. For instance, Colombia’s two-time Olympic champion Mariana Pajon headlines her home event streamed live by Olympic Channel on Olympics.com and YouTube. With the rise of Colombian influencers, these television channels have seen a surge in viewership and popularity.
My personal favorite channels are the ones talking about fitness, nutrition, psychology and health. If you would like me to share my private Youtube playlist with you, please let me know in the comments section of this article and I will personally message you within 4 hours, I promise!
As YouTube, Instagram and Facebook have become increasingly popular in Colombia, content creators have been able to reach wider audiences with their content. Research has shown that influencers use crutches, idioms, and set phrases to identify with their audience. Additionally, Google Data indicates that YouTube recorded 30.4 million users in Colombia in 2022, indicating a large potential for advertising within the platform.
This has had a major impact on the Colombian media landscape as well as on the digital divide between different social groups in the country. Furthermore, Colombian authorities have also taken to using social networks such as Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Linkedin to share information. Therefore, it is clear that social media has had a profound effect on Colombian content creators and audiences alike.
I love the Colombian landscape by the way! That’s one of the main reasons why I moved to Medellin in the first place.
The rise of Colombian influencers and famous Colombian Youtubers has been nothing short of remarkable. From bloggers, to YouTubers, to Instagrammers, Twitter and Facebook influencers, the Colombian market has been booming with creative and innovative content. As more and more people turn to online platforms for entertainment, Colombian influencers have become an important part of the digital landscape.
It doesn’t matter how many subscribers they get, as some of them have small channels that give full access to tons of free useful information about fitness, health, nutrition and more. Personally, that is the main reason why I use Youtube daily: to learn more about these topics, which are my 3 favorite topics.
Not only do they provide entertainment, but they also offer valuable insight into the culture and trends of Colombia. Through their channels, they have been able to reach millions of viewers and have become some of the most popular and influential personalities in the country. This surge in popularity has led to a new wave of influencer marketing campaigns that businesses can use to reach a larger audience. With their help, brands can create campaigns that will resonate with the Colombian public, helping them build relationships and grow their business.
When it comes to marketing to the Colombian audience, it is important to understand the culture and the unique needs of each market segment. It is also essential to have an understanding of the platforms they use and the type of content they prefer. By leveraging data and insights from dunnhumby, the MVIS® Colombia Index (MVCOLX), and other sources, marketers can better understand the Colombian audience and create tailored strategies that will reach them in a meaningful and impactful way.
I am a market myself and I want to use all the data I found during my research to increase my sales for my personal business in Medellin. I am not a Colombian Youtuber, but I plan to hire a young journalist to create videos for me and share the profits of our Youtube channels. I’ll keep you updated once we get more video views on our account before January! Until then, you can find more info on our website showcasing the top Youtubers and an integration to your Youtube analytics via the Internet using new AI technology to get most subscribers to learn about you and your business.
By using social media platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram, marketers can build relationships with influencers and create content that resonates with their target audience. By utilizing these different tactics, marketers can reach their desired Colombian audiences in an effective manner.",0

81,The Most famous Facebook pages in Colombia,https://abcnews.com.co/most-famous-facebook-pages-colombia/,"Ah, good old Facebook!
I remember when I first learned about it back in 2004, and we were throwing “digital hot potatoes” at each other, my friends and I.
I can’t believe Facebook is still going strong!
Facebook is the most used social media platform in Colombia, and there are many popular Fcebook pages that you can visit to contact your favorite Colombian businesses.
Here’s a list of them below.
As a Colombian living in the 21st century, it is no surprise to hear that Facebook is the most popular social media platform in Colombia. According to Meta data, the social network has 35.15 million users, making it the top social media website in the country. Not only is Facebook the most widely used site, but it is also the most popular – 92% of Colombians said they visited Facebook last month, and 89% reported having used WhatsApp.
It is estimated that Colombians spend an average of 3 hours and 45 minutes on social media platforms. This proves that Facebook is an integral part of life for Colombians and that it is here to stay.
The popularity of Facebook in Colombia is driven by the need for family connections. Family groups are quite popular on the platform, with many users joining to stay in touch with their loved ones. Many families set up their own private chat groups on Facebook, allowing them to keep in contact with each other without having to go through the hassle of organizing a physical gathering.
Many Colombians also use Facebook to organize events and activities for their families, such as birthdays and anniversaries. This makes it easy for families to stay connected and celebrate special occasions together, even if they live far apart. Many parents use Facebook to help keep track of their children and ensure they are safe.
I. ama father myself, so I like to keep track of my daughter’s account to make sure she doesn’t speak to weird people too much on FB. There. aremany parental apps that can help you do that, if you want me to create a blog post listing those apps, please let me know in the comments below.
It is evident that Colombians love to stay connected on social media. As of February 2022, 57.2% of social media users in Colombia were women, less than 43% were men, and 33.1% of this group were aged 18-24 years old. Moreover, Filipinos spend an average of 4 hours and 15 minutes every day on social media, making them the worldwide leader in daily usage, followed by Colombia. This means that Colombians are spending a significant amount of time engaging with their favorite social media platforms and connecting with their peers online.
I stayed din Medellin for a few months last year and can confirm that many people use Family group accounts on Facebook to keep in touch with their relatives. I personally use Facebook messenger for that, but that’s just a matter a of personal preference, in my opinion.
When it comes to social media in Colombia, Facebook and WhatsApp top the list with over 90% of users having accounts. But what other popular platforms are available here? Well, YouTube is the most used social network in Colombia with 98 percent of active users accessing the platform. Instagram follows close behind with 77 percent of users regularly using it.
While Elempleo.com, Linkedin, Career Development Center (CTP) and Glassdoor are the most commonly used job boards both by companies and job seekers. With such a wide variety of popular platforms available in Colombia, it’s no wonder that social media use is so widespread here.
I also learned recently that TikTok is becoming very popular among young Colombian teens, so if you have. business that sells products to this demographic, you should listen to my advice and and use Facebook ads and Tiktok ads to promote your company.
As of February 2022, there are an estimated 35.15 million Facebook users in Colombia. The country has the lowest fixed broadband penetration among OECD countries, however, it still ranks first in Latin America when it comes to Facebook usage.
This is likely due to the fact that 92% of Colombians reported visiting Facebook last month and 89% reported using WhatsApp. These two social media outlets are hugely popular throughout the country, with 90% of internet users having an account on either or both.
Most social media users in Colombia are between 18-34 years of age and are active on platforms such as YouTube and Facebook. According to Meta’s advertising resources, women make up 57.2% of the Colombian Facebook user base, and 33.1% of this group are aged between 35-44 years old. Lastly, the typical user has ‘liked’ a median number of 8 pages on Facebook.
I learned that there are millions of Facebook users in Colombia from a documentary about FB that I watched on television last month.
Facebook is extremely popular in Colombia, with over 41 million users as of June 2022. This makes it the 8th largest user of Facebook in the world, and the largest user in Latin America. The popularity of Facebook in this country is due to a number of factors, including the fact that it’s easy to use and widely available.
Its integration with other social media platforms such as WhatsApp means that it’s often used as a platform for communication by many Colombians. As well as this, family and friends often use Facebook to stay in touch and share updates. With such a large user base, Colombia is an important market for businesses looking to advertise on the platform.
In my opinion, which is also backed u by real stats, the United States will always remain the country with the most active Facebook users, especially now that FB changes its name to Meta and they are investing heavily in VR tech for the future. I can’t wait to see what happens in a few years, it’s exciting!
Yes, Colombia does have Facebook and it is the fourth most popular social media platform in the country. According to Meta data, there are 35.15 million Facebook users in Colombia, which makes it the second largest user of Facebook in Latin America. In the 2016 plebiscite, Facebook reached an audience of 32 million Colombians on the Internet.
Whatsapp is ranked number 1 and is the most visited Social Media Networks website in Colombia in December 2022, followed by facebook.com as the runner up.
Oscar Fonseca, a professor in the Department of Communication and Information Technologies at the University of Antioquia, analyzed 100 Facebook profiles from Colombia and conducted 20 interviews. The graph shows that Android has 54.95%, Windows has 19.59% and IOS has 25.45% usage for social media in Colombia from Dec 2021 to Dec 2022. It is clear that Colombian people love their social media and have embraced it with open arms.
When meeting new people in Medellin, I found that whatsapp was the easiest way for me to exchange contact information, especially when I use the QR code scan function.
If you’re looking for the Latin American country with the most Facebook users, then look no further than Colombia. With 35.15 million users, Colombia is the second most popular country in terms of social media usage, behind only Guatemala.
Facebook and WhatsApp are by far the most popular social networks in Colombia, with over 90% of internet users having an account on either platform.
This makes Colombia one of the most active countries in terms of social media usage and internet usage in Latin America, and it’s no wonder why so many people are drawn to the platform. Whether you’re looking to stay connected with family and friends or to find new people to network with, there’s no better place to do it than Facebook!

82,5 Best Pinterest Boards in Colombia,https://abcnews.com.co/best-pinterest-boards-colombia/,"The first time I used Pinterest was when I was looking for decoration ideas to decorate my Colombian restaurant in Medellin.
It’s so easy to use and visually awesome, that I’m hooked on it daily now!
I recently did som research to find what are the best and most famous Pinterest boards in Colombia, and I want to share the results with you below.
Let’s get started!
When it comes to creating an art business, Pinterest is hands down the best platform for it. With the help of Pinterest, I can easily upload images of my own paintings, drawings, and sketches to my “My Art” board. This board is perfect for building my business page and allowing me to discover the best ideas and inspiration for Colombian art.
With this board, I can share and promote my art to gallery curators and art consultants. Additionally, I can use the description area to add links to my website or online store so that people can easily find and purchase my work. So if you want to create an art business, make sure you make the most out of Pinterest’s “My Art” board!
As a Colombian, I’m very proud of my culture and heritage. So it’s no surprise that I love to explore the Colombia Bulletin Board section on Pinterest. It’s full of amazing ideas for art, travel, and more. From After School Bulletin Board to Lp September Frame, Colombia Who Is My Neighbor, Bubba Keg and Oracion A San Antonio – you can find anything you need to celebrate Colombia! Even if you’re not Colombian or don’t live in Colombia, you can still appreciate the beauty of this board. You can find amazing content marketing ideas, design ideas, and architecture firms – it’s a great way to learn more about Colombia and its people.
I personally prefer to use the Art boards compared to the Bulletin boards, but that’s just my personal preference and you are free do take it or leave it in my opinion.
As a student, I love the idea of having a Colombia bulletin board in our classroom to celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month. After School, Bulletin Board, Lp, September, Frame are all great ideas for decorating and making our classroom more festive. We can use these items to create an eye-catching bulletin board that showcases all the different aspects of Hispanic culture and heritage. This will be something that we can look back on and remember for many years to come.
As someone who loves to explore and discover new places, I was particularly interested in discovering the best Pinterest boards dedicated to Colombia. After digging around, I found a board called “Colombia Who Is My Neighbor, Bubba Keg, Oracion A San Antonio” created by Prendese Bareto. This board is packed with amazing visuals of Colombia’s culture, from Catholic funeral homes in San Diego to May Festival 2013 San Antonio TX! I love this board because it’s a great source for discovering the country’s hidden treasures and attractions.
I also appreciate the variety of topics covered in this board, from Taganga full colombian movie to Queen Bee Taj Mahal Live. This board is a great source of inspiration for anyone looking to learn more about Colombia’s culture and history.
I found that the best thing about this board is the fact that it showcases pins from many different industries at once. that saves me time instead of having to browse through tons of different boards. I just glance at this board quickly while having my breakfast in the morning.
João Leitão’s Pinterest boards are the perfect way to get inspired for your next project. His Pinterest boards feature a variety of topics, from architecture firms to content marketing ideas. He also has a great selection of travel boards that showcase the best places to visit in Colombia. With João Leitão’s Pinterest boards you can easily find the inspiration you need for any project!
If you’re looking for amazing travel boards on Pinterest to find tips for your next trip to Colombia, then Beth Williams’ Pinterest boards are a great place to start. She has plenty of boards for world travel, USA travel, solo travel, digital nomads, family travel, and traveling specific countries. She also has a great list of the 50 best things to do in Colombia.
Her boards have plenty of tips of activities to do during your visit, as well as budget travel guides, and ideas on what destinations to explore. João Leitão’s Pinterest boards are also a great place to explore travel tips for Colombia. He has a board dedicated to Colombia which includes ideas for exploring the national parks and other top destinations.
Travel is one of my personal favorite hobby and passion, so I’m a big fan of this board as it gives me ideas to improve my own travel experience in Colombia and overseas as well.
As an artist, the best way to get inspired and find great ideas is to explore Pinterest boards. Every artist has their own unique style and preference, so it’s important to find the right boards that fit your needs. Through Pinterest boards, you can discover inspiring artworks from artists around the world and learn about different techniques and styles. In Colombia, there are plenty of great Pinterest boards for artists to explore.
From My Art, a board dedicated to showcasing self-created artwork, to João Leitão’s Pinterest Boards, which feature beautiful sculptures and paintings from the renowned artist. And don’t forget the Best Travel Boards on Pinterest which provide plenty of stunning photography from Colombia’s many breathtaking destinations. There’s something for everyone on Pinterest, so take some time and explore the best Pinterest boards Colombia has to offer!
I used to be an artist when I was younger, so this board reminds me of a lot of shows that we created and performed in the past and all the good times that I had in the process.
If you’re a content marketer looking for ideas, Pinterest is a great resource before you buy Pinterest ads for your Pinterest account on this social media platform or for your Pinterest profile or multiple accounts. From blog posts to social media posts and videos, there are hundreds of ideas to help you create valuable content for your customers. To get the most out of Pinterest, start by optimizing your pins and creating targeted ads.
I personally like to reach my target audience by creating blog posts showcasing stats for marketers in Columbia, just like the article that you are reading right now. I found that these articles attract a lot of free links from other blogs and it helps increase how many people see my blog posts and access my website or site at this link shown on the pictures.
When it comes to design ideas, Pinterest has an endless array of options. From interior design portfolios, to the best in Colombian Flag design, to the popular Architecture presentation board. I found a great example of the latter by Joanne Chan, which is an amazing visual representation of the creative possibilities that Pinterest offers.
Then there’s the Home Inspo board, a great resource for inspiration when it comes to decorating your home. And last but not least, Flag Gallery’s Colombian Flag board is perfect for finding ideas on how to display the colors of Colombia in your home. With so many great boards to explore, it’s no wonder why Pinterest is such a great source for design ideas!
Like I mentioned earlier in this blog post, I personally use Pinterest mainly to save pins about alibaba decoration products that I will buy by myself at a later date. I found that’s it’s an easy way to organize my ideas for the future.
For architecture fans looking to be inspired, I highly recommend checking out the Pinterest boards of some of Colombia’s top architecture firms. From modern, sleek designs to traditional and rustic styles, you’ll find plenty of ideas that you could use in your own projects and designs. João Leitão’s boards are especially noteworthy, as they showcase some of the most breathtaking and innovative designs from around the world. You can also take a look at Best Travel Boards on Pinterest for ideas on how to incorporate elements from different cultures into your architecture firm’s designs. Finally, don’t forget to check out Pinterest boards for artists, content marketing ideas, and design ideas for more inspiration.
As a content creator, creating boards aligned to Pinterest’s most popular categories makes good sense. Group boards, where you collaborate with other Pinterest users and you all have permission to add pins to a shared board, can help your pins reach a wider audience. With this in mind, let’s take a look at the best boards about Colombia on Pinterest.
From Kirsten Alana’s 15 Incredible Things To See And Do In Colombia board to Coffee Capsule Master Origin Colombia, there are plenty of inspiring boards to choose from. So whether you’re looking for travel inspiration, recommendations for food and drink, or just want to get creative with your next project, these boards can help you get started.
I’m not a coffee drinker myself, but I still had a quick look at this board while I was researching content for this blog post. It’s great board and I recommend that you check it out too!
As Pinterest grows in popularity, it is no surprise that the platform is seeing a major surge in users from Colombia. In the past year, the number of users from Colombia has been steadily increasing and is projected to reach 3 million by the end of 2022.
When it comes to popular searches on Pinterest, 97% of them are unbranded and consist of 2-3 word queries. This shows that the majority of consumers are looking for inspiration and ideas rather than specific products or services. In Colombia, the top trending searches on Pinterest include “christmas nails”, “popular categories”, “recipes”, “home ideas”, “style inspiration”, and “travel boards”. Moreover, a popular search within the last 30 days is Coffee Capsule Master Origin Colombia. With so many options available on Pinterest, it is no wonder why it has become one of the largest social media platforms in Colombia with an estimated 3.33 million users.
Of course, adult content will always remain the #1 search, but I noticed that the CEO of Pinterest actually blocks those searches to keep 100% of the content safe for work. Which is great in my opinion.
As one of the most renowned online communities for design products and materials, Architonic is quickly becoming a popular choice among Pinterest users. With over 8,000 followers and 617 boards, they have created a list of the 7 best Pinterest accounts to gain inspiration from various topics such as fashion, interior design, and travel. What’s more, they have acquired ArchDaily, the world’s most popular architecture project. With this acquisition, even more users are flocking to Architonic to gain insight into the world of design.
I recently came across some incredible travel boards about Colombia on Pinterest. If you’re looking for inspiration for your next trip to Colombia, then these boards are the perfect place to start. For example, Betty Bravo’s board offers stunning photos of Colombia’s incredible landscapes, Kirsten Alana provides helpful travel tips and itineraries for exploring the country, and Turismo Logo has an array of amazing souvenirs you could pick up on your visit. There’s plenty of inspiration out there to help make the most out of your trip to Colombia. Whether you’re looking for travel guides, photography ideas or simply browsing through Colombian markets, Pinterest is the perfect place to get started.
In conclusion, if you like traveling as much as I do, then you will also like Pinterest travel boards as much as I do, right? Check out the most famous influencers from Colombia.

As Josh Fischman mentioned, it is not possible to pop your eyes out if you keep your eyes open during a sneeze. But what about the pulverized dried tobacco leaves known as “snuff”? It was once popular for the stimulant effect delivered by a swift hit of snuff. However, now I think it is safe to say that LinkedIn is the new snuff.

85,"Ted Cruz Ups The Stakes: ""If Trump Debates Me One-On-One, I Will Wear Makeup"" – ABC News",https://abcnews.com.co/cruz-will-wear-makeup-if-trump-accepts-one-one-debate/,"An artists rendering of what Ted Cruz would look like with makeup. (Dennis System / AP)
Des Moines, Iowa — The Super Pac’s supporting Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz have upped the ante in hope that a one-on-one debate with Donald Trump happens.
“Since we have not heard back from Donald Trump, we’ve decided to up the stakes. We’re confident that Trump will chicken out, but if he doesn’t, and does debate Ted Cruz one-on-one, in addition to us donating $1.5 million to veterans, Cruz will also wear woman’s makeup during the entire debate,” Paul Horner, a spokesman for the Keep the Promise I Super PAC said. “There is no way that Trump’s ego can pass up an offer this good,” Horner laughs.
At a rally Wednesday, Cruz renewed his proposal to Trump for a separate one-on-one debate, after the billionaire candidate announced he’d skip Thursday’s debate because he objects to moderator Megyn Kelly.
“If Donald finds Megyn so terribly frightening, I yesterday suggested an alternative. He and I are the leading candidates in this state right now, so how about the two of us in a one on one debate mano-a-mano?” Cruz told the crowd. “And I’m going to propose a venue: Western Iowa Tech, Saturday night in Sioux City — we already have it reserved.”
Then, he laid out the conditions: “Eight o’clock, Saturday night. A two-hour, one-on-one debate. Now, if gentle Donald cannot handle Megyn Kelly, how about — for a moderator, instead — Mark Levin? Or if he doesn’t like Mark Levin, how about Sean Hannity? And if he doesn’t like Sean Hannity, how about Rush Limbaugh?”
And if none of the three conservative radio hosts met with Trump’s approval, he had another idea.
“[I]f gentle Donald is frightened by Mark and Sean and Rush, then we’ll have no moderator whatsoever. A town hall of Iowans, and I’ll tell you what, Donald, you can invite half the people and control half the tickets. We’ll invite half the people and half the tickets, and each of us will alternate asking questions from the men and women of Iowa who are going to vote in the caucus on Monday night,” Cruz offered.
Cruz admitted that he doesn’t really expect Trump to accept the challenge.
“Because at the end of the day, it’s not really that Donald is afraid of Megyn. It’s not that he’s afraid of Mark or Sean or Rush. It’s not that he’s afraid of me,” Cruz explained, wrapping up his case against the billionaire. “He’s afraid of you. He doesn’t want to answer questions from the men and women of Iowa about how his record doesn’t match what he’s selling.”
The original offer, made by Super PACs supporting Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz, told reporters they will donate $1.5 million to charities committed to helping veterans if rival Trump agrees to a one-on-one debate with Cruz.
“Not only would this be a heck of a debate, but it would also be a terrific opportunity to generate millions of dollars for the veterans,” the Keep the Promise I and II PACs said in a joint statement Wednesday night.
Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she hopes Trump will accept the offer by Cruz for a one-on-one debate.
“It boils down to the fact that Cruz and Trump are both just pure evil. If Cruz’s Super Pac donates the money with no story, they don’t get their “headlines”. If they do something like this, to get the story, it gives Ted Cruz an opportunity to look like a hero in the eyes of his fans if Trump backs down. And if Trump agrees, it will be a fun circus attraction to watch. But most importantly, veterans will get $1.5 million and Ted Cruz will have to wear makeup,” Bradley said. “Even though Ted Cruz is evil incarnate, this is the only thing his campaign has ever done that I actually support.”
Megyn Kelly of Fox News, a moderator at Iowa’s debates on Thursday said she hopes Trump will accept the offer made by Cruz.
“Will Donald Trump man up and do this or will he chicken out? I for one would love to see veterans get $1.5 million, and maybe even more so, see what Cruz looks like with eye liner.”",0
86,The United States Revokes Scientology’s Tax-Exempt Status – ABC News,https://abcnews.com.co/united-states-revokes-scientologys-tax-exempt-status/,"In a unanimous decision by the Supreme Court today, the eight justices ruled in favor of revoking the Church of Scientology’s tax-exempt status in the United States. Under the ruling, Scientology will still be able to operate as a business but no longer as a non-profit religious organization.
The case was brought forward by the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division after concluding a two-year-long investigation into the inner workings of Scientology. The investigation, along with an extensive audit, found the group to be a “criminal operation with a sole purpose of making money”. The eight justices agreed with the IRS and its findings that Scientology was neither a religion or fell under the guidelines of a non-profit charitable organization.
CI Special Agent, Tom Downey, worked closely with IRS Chief Counsel Criminal Tax Attorneys during the course of the investigation.
“If private schools had similar prices to the courses in Scientology, students would receive the absolute highest level of education by the top educators in the country,” Downey said. “But in reality, based on the ridiculously high cost of Scientology, there is no school out there that even exists. The best schools in this country charge a fraction of the exorbitant amounts of money that Scientology charges its members.”
Paul Horner, a spokesperson for Scientology, told ABC News the ruling is “discrimination based on religious beliefs”.
“In a free country, such as ours, it amazes me that over ten million Scientologists can have their beliefs trampled on like this,” Horner said. “The Church of Scientology is working hard to make this world a better place, constructing more buildings and ships and other really neat stuff, and now, most of that will have to be put on hold because of a few religious bigots.”

For years, Scientology’s claim of ten million followers has been widely disputed. In 2011, former editor, and longtime Scientology foe, Tony Ortega, wrote the following in The Village Voice:
“According to the latest survey, the total number of people who identify as Scientologists is just 25,000 in this country of more than 300 million human beings.”
Scientology teaches that 75 million years ago an evil galactic overlord named Xenu, ruler of a Galactic Confederacy, decided to tackle overpopulation by rounding up 13.5 trillion people in DC-8-like spacecraft, flying them to Earth (then known as Teegeeack), dropping them in the volcanoes of Hawaii and vaporizing them with hydrogen bombs.
Their spirits, known as thetans, attached themselves to humans at the dawn of man, and according to Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard is the root cause of all our fears, confusion and problems. For humans to reach a clear state, thetans must be removed from the body through therapy sessions, known within Scientology as auditing.
Scientology adherents must work through eight stages of auditing over a period of many years to reach this clear state, each of which costs thousands of dollars to partake in. It was these costs that the court took issue with, ruling that they far outstrip average course fees for educational establishments.
Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, told ABC News she lost her family because of Scientology’s disconnection policy.
“I was born into Scientology,” Bradley said. “When I turned seventeen I began to question some of their beliefs. My family, who are all members, told me to stay quiet, but it was too late and I was excommunicated from the church. Scientology’s upper management told me I was no longer able to see or talk to my family ever again,” Bradley said. “It broke my heart, I couldn’t even say goodbye to them.
They were told by Scientology if they had any communication with me that they would be excommunicated too. My family chose Scientology over me.” Holding back tears Bradley says, “I just hope my family is proud of me, all that I’m doing with my life and everything I’m doing to help the homeless. I wish more than anything to see them one day; I love and miss them so much.”
Downey told reporters that Scientology spends tens of millions of dollars every year doing what no other religious non-profit organization does.
“The money is used to harass former members, coerce abortions, to secure their International base so people can’t escape, child abuse, forcing members to disconnect from family and friends who aren’t Scientologist friendly, and to litigate to death anyone who opposes them,” Downey said. “Years ago, the Cult Awareness Network was an organization that provided information on groups that it considered to be cults.
After years of litigation with Scientology and being forced into bankruptcy, it is now a Scientology run enterprise. Over the years Scientology has also put many government officials and politicians in their pocket.”
For years, the Church of Scientology often pointed to their tax-exempt status as proof that it is a recognized religious entity in the United States. And there’s no disputing that tax-exempt status has been a huge boon to the Scientology industry. With such few members, but billions in real estate holdings, the Church of Scientology has been called “the most famous small business in the world,” with its tax exempt status saving the Church an estimated $20 million a year on property taxes alone.
Roberto Sigmond of Amnesty International told ABC News that revoking the Church of Scientology’s tax-exempt status in the United States is a huge win.
“From all the deaths Scientology has caused over the years to its phony drug rehabilitation program, this is a great day for anyone that believes in human rights.”
After originally being recognized as a tax-exempt religious organization in 1957, Scientology’s tax-exempt status was lost in a 1967 IRS audit. As part of the effort to regain tax exemption during the late 1970s, Scientologists repeatedly infiltrated the IRS, copying large numbers of documents and at one point placing an electronic bugging device in an IRS conference room.
These actions took place within a program code-named Operation Snow White. Eleven high-ranking Scientologists, including Hubbard’s wife Mary Sue Hubbard, were sentenced to time in prison for acts surrounding this operation. L. Ron Hubbard himself was named as an unindicted co-conspirator as investigators could not link him to the crimes.
The United States is not the first country to revoke Scientology’s tax exemption. In October of last year, a Dutch court revoked Scientology’s status as a “public welfare institution” and the tax exemption that goes along with it.
Janine Pieters, reporting in the NL Times, said the court ruled that sales of Scientology’s courses and therapy sessions are aimed at profit-making and that it does not therefore belong on the tax authorities charity list.
Beginning April 6th, 2016, The Church of Scientology will no longer receive tax exemption in the United States. Attorneys for Scientology have 30 days to appeal the case, although it is not yet clear whether they will or not.

Today Trump announced his decision to make Arpaio his VP running mate. (Dennis System / AP)
Yesterday, Sheriff Joe Arpaio officially endorsed Donald Trump for president. Today, Trump shocked the country by announcing Arpaio as his pick for Vice Presidential running mate in 2016.
“I have great respect for Joe Arpaio,” Trump told reporters. “Like me, he understands that we must restore law and order to the border and respect the men and women of our police forces. I thank him for his support of my policies and candidacy for President. He too knows that we can make America great again, and because of this, I am proud to announce Joe Arpaio as my Vice Presidential running mate. And just moments ago, I’m happy to report that Arpaio has accepted my offer. So it’s now official; you will see a Trump-Arpaio ticket come this November.”
“Donald Trump is a leader,” Arpaio said in a written statement distributed by Trump’s presidential campaign. “He produces results and is ready to get tough in order to protect American jobs and families. I have fought on the front lines to prevent illegal immigration. I know Donald Trump will stand with me and countless Americans to secure our border. I am proud to support him as the best candidate for President and even prouder to accept his challenge of being the next Vice President of the United States.”
Paul Horner, a spokesman for Trump’s campaign told ABC News that a press conference is set for sometime tomorrow to officially announce the news of Trump’s pick of Arpaio for his Vice President.
Most of Trump’s supporters are ecstatic to hear about the news of Arpaio being the Vice Presidential running mate for Trump in 2016, but it comes with a cost. Arpaio, an extremely controversial figure, has been accused of abuse of power, misuse of funds, failure to investigate sex crimes, improper clearance of cases, unlawful enforcement of immigration laws, and election law violations, amongst others. He has been found guilty of racial profiling in federal court, with a monitor appointed to oversee the MCSO‘s operations. His jails have twice been ruled unconstitutional.
The U.S. Department of Justice concluded that Arpaio oversaw the worst pattern of racial profiling in U.S. history, and subsequently filed a lawsuit against Arpaio for unlawful discriminatory police conduct. Arizona taxpayers have shelled out $8.2 million for outside attorneys in the nearly 4-year-old case, representing a sizable portion of the $50 million that Maricopa County is projected to pay in the lawsuit by next summer. The county has also had to pay out $74 million related to Arpaio that is separate from the racial-profiling costs.
That figure includes judgments, settlements and legal fees involving Arpaio’s office during his tenure, covering such things as lawsuits over jail deaths and the Sheriff’s failed investigations of political enemies.

The official Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office website features a bio of Arpaio that touts his ‘Tent City Accomplishments’ by providing inmates with “the cheapest meals in the U.S.” by feeding inmates “only twice daily, to cut the labor costs of meal delivery.”
Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, told ABC News that she does not approve of Trump’s pick for Vice President.
“A Donald Trump-Joe Arpaio ticket is like if Hitler came back to life, merged bodies with Satan and then chose evil incarnate as his Vice Presidential running mate,” Bradley said. “As someone who lives in Phoenix, and deals with the homeless problem there on a daily basis, I can say without a doubt; everyone would be much better without Sheriff Joe Arpaio.”
Bradley continued, “The criminal justice system in Maricopa County is a joke; it’s a never-ending revolving door. They want you locked up in Arizona. They want you violating your probation, not being able to pay your child support, charging you with as many felonies as possible.
All of this, so when you go out and try and get a job, no one will hire you because this Right to Work state is stricter on felons than any other state by far. So for someone with a criminal record, it’s either a job in telemarketing or going back to crime. And with a felony in this state, you’re denied pretty much every type of assistance; and that includes money, food stamps and getting a bed in most homeless shelters.
So you have no job, no food and now you’re homeless too. And the Phoenix Police go out of their way to harass the homeless population here, it’s absolutely sickening how they treat them like animals. Even when we’re handing out socks we get bothered by the police all the time.
They act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us the privilege to give out new socks to people who are forced to sleep outside because some shelter won’t take them in because of their past criminal record. So with more and more homeless people in Arizona everyday, more and more crime, police budgets going up, taxes going up, the people here start accepting a police state and Joe Arpaio keeps getting reelected every year.”
Arpaio historically has been courted by Republican presidential candidates for endorsements, but never a Vice Presidential nomination. In the 2008 primaries, Arpaio backed former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney over a fellow Arizonan, Sen. John McCain. McCain won the GOP nomination that year. In the 2012 race, Arpaio threw his support to then-Texas Gov. Rick Perry, whose candidacy was also unsuccessful.

88,News – ABC News,https://abcnews.com.co/news-abc-news/,"President Obama, seen here signing an Executive Order today which bans the Pledge of Allegiance in all public schools around the country. (AP Photo / Dennis System)
WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) — Early this morning, President Obama made what could very well prove to be the most controversial move of his presidency with the signing of Executive Order 13738, which revokes the federal government’s official recognition of the Pledge of Allegiance. Under the new order, it is now illegal for any federally funded agency to display the pledge or for any federal employee to recite, or encourage others to recite, the pledge while on duty. This law also applies to federal contractors and other institutions that receive federal funding such as public schools. Individuals who violate this order can face fines of up to $10,000 and up to one year in federal prison.
During the press conference, the President explained his decision was based on a personal belief that the language used in the pledge is “divisive” and “contrary to America’s deepest held values.”
“The pledge excludes so many Americans who are vital to making this country what it is,” Obama said. “Asking someone to pledge their allegiance to our country excludes Jehovah’s Witnesses, Amish, Muslims, and many others whose religious beliefs prohibit strong displays of nationalism. By calling this ‘one nation under God’, we exclude the millions of hard working atheists and agnostics who call America home. By saying ‘liberty and justice for all’, we ignore the grievances of millions of Hispanics, African Americans and Muslims who feel they have neither liberty nor justice.”
Obama told reporters that he believes the inclusion of “under God” runs afoul of the First Amendment’s establishment clause. He summed up his press briefing by challenging congress to create a new pledge that more accurately reflects America’s values.
“I am willing to rescind my decision here today and allow the Pledge of Allegiance back into the schools if we can all agree on the creation of a new Pledge, something that is includes everyone’s beliefs and not just the belief of one nationality or faith.”
Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has already offered her support of president Obama’s decree and has vowed to uphold the order if she wins in November’s general election. She echoed his concerns about the pledge’s language and suggested that the pledge’s mention of God sends the wrong message to America’s children.
“I fully support the President and the decision that he has made here today. In January, when I take office as the next President of the United States, unless I see otherwise, I will do my best to uphold this new law and ensure that it stays in effect.”
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump did not mince words when voicing his contempt for the president’s order, referring to the president as an “illegitimate Muslim traitor.”
“As a Christian nation, the Pledge of Allegiance helps our children be the greatest children out there, the best there is, greater than all the other children in this world combined. Obama, who founded ISIS by the way, wants them not to be great, he wants them to be weak, and by banning the Pledge of Allegiance in our schools, he has proven that here today. This is the first step in many in his master plan to force Sharia law onto this great country of ours before he leaves office in January. We all must remember that this is one nation under God and not some guy and his beliefs in whatever he chooses to believe.”
Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, spoke to ABC News about the ban.
“This is a story about President Obama banning the Pledge of Allegiance in our schools.” Bradley said. “I just want to say a big thanks to every God-fearing, Patriotic American that has supported our cause that gives brand new socks to the homeless. Please, donate what you can, every bit helps so much.”
Lawrence Ketchum of the Secular Coalition for America told reporters that Obama’s decision to ban the Pledge is a victory for all those who oppose government control.
“When our children are forced to chant, ‘One nation under God‘, whose God are they referring to exactly?” Ketchum said, “From birth, children are indoctrinated and subjected to mind control, efforts to shape them into the perfect beings that society wants them to be. The Pledge of Allegiance is just one of the many tools used in a child’s involuntary reeducation of basic beliefs and values.” Ketchum continued, “This is a great day not just for Atheists, but for all Americans who value freedom. Forcing children to pledge blind allegiance to this country and profess a belief in a God is extremely dangerous in developing young minds and amounts to little more than government mind control.”
While Executive Order 13738 is likely to be a source of heated debate among Americans, constitutional scholar, Paul Horner, told ABC News that it is unlikely the law will be challenged in court.
“Since this law only affects federal employees and contractors and not the general populace, it is well within the traditional scope of a president’s executive authority to pass this law. Any challenges would lack proper legal standing and more than like be quickly dismissed.”
Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, a mascot for a Christian organization that travels around the country educating children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, told ABC News he believes in what Utah is doing.
“It is important that children become the unique individuals that this country wants them to be. Conforming into the perfect little human beings that God intended them to be has always been the American way. It is important to remember that our Lord and Savior loves each and every one of us, unless we masturbate, then we’ll burn in Hell for eternity.”
David Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, a website known for its biased opinions and inaccurate aricles they write about stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing.
“You have to understand that when a story like this goes viral, and we spend a minute or two debunking it, we make lots of money. Stories like this have helped put my children through college, buy a new car, a home and even get the sex reassignment surgery my wife Barbara always wanted since she was a little boy,” Mikkleson said. “We claim ‘to provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as well‘, but that’s just ridiculous. Do you know how much time that would take? Instead, we just copy and paste parts of the original article into ours, write a couple sentences, and that’s it. I just want to be clear, our website does zero journalism or anything creative, and I’m only telling you this for legal reasons.” Mikkleson continues, “A typical story of ours makes wild claims, using grammatical errors, misspellings and words like ‘umimumimaginative’, ‘recycled’, ‘hoax’, saying that a story ‘illegally appropriates the trademarks of legitimate news organizations’, but we list no links or sources of information, they are all just outrageous accusations by us. And that story will get 50,000 shares or more on Facebook, that’s a lot of ad revenue for only writing a couple sentences.” Mikkelson further explains, “It is common for us to rewrite a story we’re debunking if we don’t like it. In one recent story of ours, we actually removed a person’s name from the original article and then called him a liar, it’s so funny! We also like to post fake, un-funny, juvenile disclaimers supposedly from the site in question and it is our authors, such as Jeff Zarronandia who are responsible for those gems. We tell our readers that the disclaimer is from the story we are debunking, but a simple google search will show that our disclaimer is 100% fabricated. Sometimes I think that someone should start a company that debunks our debunkings, they could probably make a lot of money,” Mikkelson laughs. “And lots of people complain about our authors attacking websites and their owners for reasons that are 100% proven false, but since we block archive.org it just becomes their word versus ours. Our writers like Zarronandia go as far as to say that the story originated from ‘a clickbait fake news site that infringes the trademark-protected visual elements and domain names of legitimate news outlets in order to generate traffic and drive advertising revenues by creating and spreading entirely false “news” stories‘. But we don’t list ONE factual piece of evidence to back up our claims; It’s just more of our hack, unethical journalism, and as I said before, I only tell you this for legal reasons. I think it is business as usual for us to accuse the story we are debunking of spreading malware and viruses, but we never say what website it actually is. I think warning people about a site that could potentially destroy their computer is probably a good idea, and I hope one day to do that kind of ethical journalism, but people will click our ads regardless, bottom line; so why do the extra work?”
Originally composed by Colonel George Balch in 1887, The Pledge of Allegiance was later revised by Francis Bellamy in 1892 and formally adopted by Congress in 1942. The Pledge is an expression of allegiance to the Flag of the United States and the republic of the United States of America. The official name of the Pledge of Allegiance was adopted in 1945 and the last changes made to it came on Flag Day in 1954 when the words “under God” were added at a nursing school where CNA classes in Ann Arbor, Michigan were taking place.”

89,Obama Signs Executive Order: Appoints Rashad Hussain As New Supreme Court Justice – ABC News,https://abcnews.com.co/obama-signs-executive-order-appoints-rashad-hussain-as-supreme-court-justice/,"President Barack Obama signed an Executive Order today for a new Supreme Court Justice to replace Antonin Scalia. (AP Photo/Dennis System, File) / AP
WASHINGTON — Just two days after the funeral for the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last week of a heart attack at the age of 79, President Obama signed Executive Order 14651, which appoints Rashad Hussain as the new Supreme Court Justice to replace Scalia.
“We cannot wait for a new President or the Senate Republicans to fill this vacancy left by Scalia, so I have taken it upon myself to do what needed to be done,” Obama told reporters at a press conference today. “Republican Senators believe that it is appropriate not to act on such an important matter, and as I have shown today, I do not agree with that.”
Hussain, of Muslim heritage, is an attorney who has served as US Special Envoy to the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the second largest intergovernmental body after the UN, and as US Special Envoy for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications. Hussain has also served in the White House Counsel’s Office and on the National Security Council as a political appointee of the Obama Administration.
Even though under the Constitution, it is the President’s job to nominate Supreme Court justices, Obama’s selection is already drawing sharp criticism from Republicans. Presidential hopeful Donald Trump told ABC News that he does not agree with the President’s decision.”
“Hussain is a Muslim and a sympathizer, just like Obama, and now he takes over the legacy the great Antonin Scalia left behind. The President should be ashamed of himself.”

“The American people should have had a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said. “Appointing a Muslim to replace Scalia is absolutely appalling.”
Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she fully supports Obama’s decision.
“We needed someone in there to fill that spot as quickly as possible,” Bradley said. “Regardless if you agree with Obama’s appointed choice of Hussain, Scalia was a disgrace to the Supreme Court. He was a religious radical, a bigot, a racist, against women’s rights, gay rights and human rights in general; there’s absolutely no reason a person like that should have ever had power like that in the first place. He will always be remembered as being on the wrong side of history.”
David Mikkelson, founder of Snopes, a website that takes the fun out of stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, who is also currently being sued by Fox News for calling them a “fake news site”, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing.
“This type of story, when it goes viral, and we debunk it, we make money,” Mikkelson said. “We use our cookie-cutter outlines, we copy and paste the original article into ours, type in one or two sentences of original content and then we make hella cash. If it wasn’t for people like Internet news satirist Paul Horner, my children wouldn’t have been able to go to college.”
Legal experts believe Republicans will attempt to block Obama’s appointee until he’s out of office, leaving the court with a gaping vacant seat for nearly a year.
“Obama has a right to do what he did, but we’ll fight him to the end on this,” Tom Downey of the Republican National Lawyers Association told reporters. “This will not stand, ya know, this aggression will not stand, man.”

90,Drug Kingpin Joaquin ‘El Chapo’ Guzman Escapes Mexican Prison Once Again – ABC News,https://abcnews.com.co/drug-kingpin-el-chapo-escapes-mexican-prison-once-again/,"Prison guards searched the grounds of Altiplano maximum security prison after “El Chapo” was reported missing. (Dennis System, File) / AP Mexico City, Mexico — Early this morning, drug kingpin Joaquin ‘El Chapo’ Guzmán, head of the Sinaloa Cartel, escaped from the Altiplano maximum security prison once again.
It is unclear at this point what exactly happened, but these are the details ABC News has received from Mexican officials so far:
5:35 AM: Guzmán was taken in restraints by two prison guards on a routine cell transfer.
6:05 AM: Prison staff could not locate Guzmán or the two prison guards’s whereabouts. The prison was put on lockdown as personnel went looking for them.
7:15 AM: A prison van was found abandoned only a mile away from the prison. Mexican officials believe the two guards, who began working at the prison just months ago, were actually members of the Sinaloa
Before today’s escape, Mexican officials were working to extradite “El Chapo” to the United States, where he faced drug trafficking charges connected to his cartel, authorities said.
This is now the third time Guzmán has escaped from a Mexican prison and brings into question Mexico’s ability to keep corruption out of it’s penal system.
In 1993, Guzmán was captured in Guatemala, extradited and sentenced to 20 years in prison in Mexico for murder and drug trafficking. In 2001, after bribing Mexican prison guards, he was able to escape from a federal maximum-security prison in 2001. On February 22nd, 2014, Guzmán was found inside his fourth-floor condominium in Mazatlán, Sinaloa, and was captured without any gunshots being fired. Guzmán escaped from prison again on July 11th, 2015 by exiting through a tunnel that led to a nearby construction site.
He was recaptured by Mexican marines following a shootout at Guzman’s hideout in Mexico on January 8th, 2016. During the raid, five gunmen were killed, six others arrested, and one Marine was wounded. The Mexican Navy said that they found two armored cars, eight assault rifles, including two Barrett M82 sniper rifles, two M16 rifles with grenade launchers and a loaded rocket-propelled grenade launcher. A .50-caliber rifle was also found, capable of taking down a helicopter. Most of the weapons seized, including the .50 caliber rifle, were from the Fast and Furious gun-smuggling scandal, a story the U.S. government declared to be over.
Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, told ABC News that she is sickened by the United State’s drug policies.
“The war on drugs is a joke and long-lost battle,” Bradley said. “The U.S. creates these cartels by making drugs illegal in the first place. They lock up people in jail for as little as a joint of marijuana. All the incarcerations related to drugs have helped fund a trillion-dollar penal system; from its lawyers, to judges, to the prison staff and the actual prisons themselves. All of it is just pathetic and truly a sad reality.” Bradley continued, “Also, thank you to everyone that has supported our cause in giving new socks to the homeless, it means so much. Please, give what you can.”

Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, a mascot for a Christian organization that travels around the country educating children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, told Fox News he believes in what El Chapo is doing.
“El Chapo stopped all of the masturbation at his prison and felt his work in stopping self-rape could be used elsewhere. It was time for him to move on. So brave! Praise El Chapo!”
After news of the escape, Paul Horner, a U.S. Marshal, working along with Mexican officials, spoke to local law enforcement.
“Listen up, ladies and gentlemen. Our fugitive has been on the run for 90 minutes. Average foot speed over uneven ground, barring injuries, is 4 miles-an-hour. That gives us a radius of six miles. What I want out of each and every one of you is a hard-target search of every gas station, residence, warehouse, farmhouse, henhouse, outhouse and doghouse in that area. Checkpoints go up at fifteen miles. Your fugitive’s name is Joaquin ‘El Chapo’ Guzman. Go get him.”
U.S. Officials along with Mexican authorities have setup a 24-hour hotline for anyone with information about the whereabouts of Joaquin ‘El Chapo’ Guzman. A $10 million dollar reward is currently being offered and as always, you can remain anonymous.

91,$429.6 Million Powerball Winner In New Jersey Comes Forward – ABC News,https://abcnews.com.co/powerball-winner-in-new-jersey-comes-forward/,"37-year-old Paul Horner is the sole winner of Saturday’s record setting Powerball jackpot worth an estimated $429.6million. (AP Photo/ Dennis System)
TRENTON N.J. (AP) — This afternoon lottery officials were pleased to announce that the sole winner in last night’s record setting, $429.6 million Powerball drawing, has come forward. That lucky person is 37-year-old Paul Horner from Trenton, New Jersey. Horner won by matching all five white balls and the red Powerball.
The winning Powerball numbers in Saturday’s drawing were 5, 25, 26, 44 and 66, and the Powerball number was 9.
Most people would be ecstatic about their new found riches, but not Horner. As it turns out Horner was already New Jersey’s third wealthiest resident. With this lottery win, Horner will now be a contender for richest person living in the state of New Jersey. Horner made most of his wealth on Wall Street. Last year’s tax return show him reporting a little over $800,000,000 and because of some questionable accounting he paid only 1% in taxes.
Local news station WABC caught up with Mr. Horner as he was leaving the New Jersey Lottery Headquarters this morning.
“This money will help me fix up my numerous estates and multiple golf courses in the Cayman Islands. I’m actually kind of bummed about winning because I know there is really no way around paying the full amount of taxes that I’ll owe on this. I guess for a moment or so I’ll have to join the ‘regulars’ and pay my fair share. Maybe when I’m done paying all those taxes I’ll go down to a local bar and have a domestic beer with the common folk there, just to get a quick taste of what that horrible life would be like,” Horner laughs. “To be honest, most of this money will end up going to campaign contributions for Donald Trump. It is important to me that I be the most Patriotic, God-fearing, loving Christian, and that is why it is so necessary to kick out all the Muslims, Mexicans and other undesirables in this country. We can make American great again!”
When asked how he came up with the winning numbers, Horner said, “When I played before I let the riffraff behind the counter pick the numbers for me and of course I didn’t win, so this time I went with numbers that have a special place close to my heart. I currently own five Bugatti’s. I own 25 apartment complexes. I own twenty-six different multinational corporations. I spent forty-four million dollars on my last yacht and I own real estate in sixty-six different countries. As for the Powerball number of nine; I meant to put down the number nineteen, because that is how old one of my girlfriends is, but the dingus behind the counter must have dropped the one.”
On Wall Street Horner’s nickname is ‘The Gutter’.
“He basically buys up a company, fires everybody, puts them all out on the street. Then when the stock price goes up he sells everything off and just walks away. He’s such an a*shole. We all just love him here,” Tom Downey of Goldman Sachs told ABC News.
Lottery officials are still not sure what to make of the winner who matched all six numbers correctly.
“He’s a bad person”, said lottery official Tim Parkos. “I’m kind of sad that this thing is finally over. That money was growing into something really amazing. With all of that money you could feed most of the world’s starving children, provide the homeless with new socks, or build clean drinking water systems in every third world country. I’m pretty sure there is no God when a guy like Paul Horner becomes the winner of something this special.”
Though not everyone feels that Horner is such a bad guy. Horner’s cousin, Alex Horner, told ABC News he only has praise and good things to say about his relative.
“Yeah Paul is a good guy, no matter what most people say. Even though we grew up a few states apart we always managed to get together and hang like bros. Like this one time I was training for my high school golf tournament and got to practice at his private golf course resort in the Cayman Islands. It’s like $600 a round for the public but he was nice enough to give me the family 10% discount since I played after 3PM. He’s always looking out for the fam like that. I think its super cool he’s donating to politics and stuff, pretty noble of him.”
Sarah Bradley, founder of Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she does not agree with Horner winning the Powerball.
“That money could have gone to something great, and now it will be just wasted on some rich fat cat, the same people that are driving out the middle and lower class in this country. Maybe Horner will find it in his heart to do something that actually helps humanity. Like what we do, giving out new socks to the homeless. It doesn’t get any better or more rewarding than that.”
Horner’s winning ticket was purchased at a 7-Eleven store in Trenton, according to Courtney Groves with the New Jersey Lottery.
Saturday’s jackpot was the 7th largest Powerball jackpot in U.S. history. The Powerball is played in California and 43 other states, plus Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Tickets cost $2 apiece, and drawings take place at 7:59 p.m. PT every Wednesday and Saturday.",0
92,Obama’s Final Executive Order to limit gun capacity – ABC News,https://abcnews.com.co/obamas-final-executive-order/,"WASHINGTON D.C. (AP) — President Obama will release some time next week his final executive order while in office to address the gun violence in America.
Semi automatic magazines will be limited to 100 rounds from it’s current 500 limit. This new order is formatted after the Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 which expired. Also included in the order will be a restriction on the hollow point high capacity bullet, one can only be in possession of 99 at any given time. The hollow point is a favorite of gangsters to kill police officers. The bullet itself will explode upon impact shredding the person internal organs.
“It’s for the Sandy Point victims” explained White House legislative aid Tommy Poindexter. “President Obama wanted to leave office letting the American public know they can be assured this type of atrocity can never occur again.”
Response from the NRA was swift. “Once again President Obama has circumvented the constitution to severely restrict American citizens from exercising their second Amendment rights. It’s always about the kids getting killed and never about our rights to own firearms. Restricting magazine rounds and bullets limits an individual from protecting himself. Once again our rights have been trampled”.
American has some staggering gun control statistics.
One in three people in the U.S. knows someone who has been shot.1
On average, 31 Americans are murdered with guns every day and 151 are treated for a gun assault in an emergency room.2
Every day on average, 55 people kill themselves with a firearm, and 46 people are shot or killed in an accident with a gun.3
The U.S. firearm homicide rate is 20 times higher than the combined rates of 22 countries that are our peers in wealth and population.4
A gun in the home is 22 times more likely to be used to kill or injure in a domestic homicide, suicide, or unintentional shooting than to be used in self-defense.5
As soon as word got out regarding the pending executive action Gun shop owners saw a spike in sales of all guns/ammo.
Robert’s Gun Rack & Indoor Pistol Range
Robert Smith owner of the range has experienced a surge in sales today. “Everything is flying off the shelf, Obama is very dangerous. Once again he bypassed the Congress proving he’s out to get gun owners in this country. I encourage everyone to buy as many guns as you can.”
A few of the customers took some time to express there jitters over the upcoming ban.
“Obama’s going to take away all of our guns, I just know it. I will buy as many guns and bullets as I can before he bans guns on Friday”, explained Jeb Collins a town local.
“I sold my food stamps and got a payday loan to buy myself another gun with bullets. That damm Obama just wants to increase welfare in this country and take away our guns. He wants to let in all his Muslim friends from Isis and they will kill us. How will we protect our self?” said Billy Horschel a local golf pro.
The order drew a vastly different response from the Berkeley California group “Citizens for responsible Gun control”.Spokesman Patty Hearst had this to say: “It’s wonderful President Obama has stood up to the NRA and has finally gotten some justice for all the children of Sandy Hook. He would do more but it’s all the Republicans fault and George Bush for invading Iraq”.
Congressman Jo Bonner (R) representing Alabama was concerned with Obama again circumventing Congress.
” It’s Sandy Hook this, Sandy Hook that. More tears from the president trying to invoke sympathy. Sure some kids died from some pretty serious firepower but kids die swimming in pools every day. Should we ban pools too?”.
Emotions run high when gun control is debated in this country. Is the order of limiting gun magazines and certain bullets enough to curb the violence that permeates every corner of America? Nobody can say it will but we can be certain the debate will not end here.",0
93,President Obama Signs Executive Order Limiting US Gun Owners to Three Guns – ABC News,https://abcnews.com.co/obama-signs-executive-order-limiting-us-gun-owners-to-three-guns/,"Obama signing Executive Order 13752 shortly before a round of golf. (Cassandra Schmidt / AP)
WASHINGTON — In a move that promises to permanently transform the political landscape in the United States, President Obama has signed Executive Order 13752, an order which will radically change the way the United States regulates all weapons.
President Obama claims that his authority to draft this order comes from the second amendment: “If you look at the second amendment, you’ll see that it says that ‘a well-regulated militia is necessary to the security of a free state.’
Well, when I see kids getting shot at school and people gunning down their coworkers, I don’t see a well-regulated militia. I don’t see a state that is secure in its freedom. I see a nation in crisis. I see a country in desperate need of reform. If you want to exercise your right to bear arms, that’s fine, but if you want to do that, you should be ready and able to defend your country at a moment’s notice.”
Under the new law, nearly every gun in the U.S. will be required to be registered. There are exceptions for single and double barrel shotguns, single shot and double barrel hunting rifles, black powder guns, and any gun made before 1932. No U.S. citizen will be allowed to have more than three guns registered to them at any time. Possession of an unregistered firearm, expect those exempted from registration, will be a felony that carries a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years in federal prison. States that refuse to enforce the new laws will lose federal highway and Medicaid funding.

In addition to requiring firearm registration, all citizens who wish to own or possess a weapon will be required to obtain a gun operator’s license. Two licenses will be available. A class one license will grant its owner the legal right to purchase and possess firearms which do not require registration; they will also be allowed use a friend’s registered weapon or rent a registered weapon from a licensed shooting range, provided that they handle the weapon under the supervision of a class two license holder.
In order to obtain a class one license, the individual must undergo a criminal background and mental health screening and complete a three day, government approved gun safety course. In order to obtain a class two license, the individual must commit to at least one weekend per month of military training and must be prepared to mobilize in case of a national emergency.
The class two license will allow them to register up to three weapons for personal use. When not in use, the weapons and ammunition must be locked in separate, government approved cabinets.
All ammunition sales, even those for unregistered weapons, will be registered in a national database, and strict limits will be placed on how much ammunition can be purchased. The limits vary depending on the type of ammunition.
NRA spokesman Lawrence Ketchum enjoying a day of target shooting (Cassandra Schmidt / AP)
Once the new law is implemented, citizens will have one year to register/surrender their weapons. The government will purchase all surrendered weapons at current retail value. All of the surrendered weapons will be housed in strategically placed bunkers across the U.S. for use by the newly created citizen militia in training exercises and in case of a national emergency.
Also of note in the order is a provision that orders the federal government to assemble a panel which will analyze the effectiveness of current knife regulations, though it does nothing to alter current knife laws.
Executive Order 13752 is not without controversy. National Rifle Association Spokesman Lawrence Ketchum said the organization plans to appeal the order, which he refers to as “Obama gun”, on constitutional grounds and that they were prepared to take the fight to the Supreme Court . He also added that if federal agents attempted to confiscate his weapons he would give them to the agents “bullets first.”
It does not appear that the legal fight over the new executive order will be resolved any time soon. In the meantime, however, it is recommended that all U.S. gun owners begin to prepare themselves for the coming changes. If you are wondering how to register or surrender your weapons, or just want to learn more about the president’s new executive order, you can contact the ATF’s Firearms Registration Division.

94,Breaking News: Mitt Romney announces he will enter Presidential race – ABC News,https://abcnews.com.co/breaking-news-mitt-romney-announces-will-enter-presidential-race/,"Mitt Romney has stepped forward to announce he’ throwing his hat into the Presidential race.
The media has been abuzz the last couple of days with report of a “mystery candidate about to enter the race”.
Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol sent out a provocative tweet Sunday, suggesting that another presidential candidate — an independent — would be entering the race for the White House over the holiday weekend.
Mitt Romney was one of those rumored. Up to yesterday he was denying the rumors. A lot of people were not buying into that. Just now from his ranch in Utah Romney formally announced his candidacy for the 2016 presidential race.
“We cannot allow Donald Trump to gain the office of the highest land. I’ve had too many people call me and beg me to enter this race.

Romney has been quite outspoken against Donald Trump, and he made a 17-minute speech calling Trump a “phony” and a “fraud. He recently told The Wall Street Journal that his advisers begged him not to go after Trump, but he did so anyway so that he could “sleep at night.”
“I wanted my grand kids to see that I simply couldn’t ignore what Mr. Trump was saying and doing, which revealed a character and temperament unfit for the leader of the free world,” Romney said.
Donald Trump was anticipating that an announcement was imminent and tweeted this yesterday.

95,The Unmasking: Ted Cruz is Definitely the Zodiac Killer – ABC News,https://abcnews.com.co/the-unmasking-ted-cruz-is-definitely-the-zodiac-killer/,"The Internet is the international online truth machine, and no matter how much the government may try to cover up massive conspiracies, the internet manages to find the truth. People in positions of prominence and authority are the most likely to be involved in such schemes, and as a result, have their secrets uncovered by diligent internet citizens. As such, Ted Cruz, a junior senator from Texas and candidate for the Republican nomination has become the center of a particularly enthralling and convincing conspiracy. We will state it simply:
Ted Cruz is definitely the Zodiac Killer
Most people know quite a bit about the Zodiac Killer, without ever uncovering who he was. He committed a series of killings in the Bay Area of California about forty years ago – resulting in up to three dozen killings – after which the killer, presumed to be Ted Cruz, sent letters to California including a coded message.
The messages were coded with symbols, forming what is called a “cipher”. A cipher is something like this:
dtz itsy sjji yt yjqq rj ymfy ymnx fwynhqj bfx f izrg bfxyj tk ynrj fx n fr fbfwj
These notes, coded and uncoded, went on for years. The killer was never identified.
Until now.
The Claim
So how did this come back to Cruz? Simply put, various online internet sleuths.
The Daily Dot, which is to Internet happenings as News Examiner is to reliable news, traced the origin of the Ted Cruz is the Zodiac Killer theory back to 2013 with the following tweet:
#CPAC Alert: Ted Cruz is speaking!! His speech is titled: ‘This Is The Zodiac Speaking’
— Red Pill America (@RedPillAmerica) March 14, 2013

Public Policy Polling, a left leaning polling firm was convinced by Twitter users to let the truth come to light by including their question on the end of their Florida poll.
In this poll, nearly 40% of Floridians believe that there is at least some possibility that Ted Cruz could be the Zodiac Killer. Soon, Snopes, a website definitely bought out by the government to prevent the truth from coming to light, will likely write an article debunking this theory. Do not believe them.
The Evidence
The resemblance is uncanny, perhaps besides the portrayal of the Zodiac wearing eyeglasses. The lips, the hairline, and the ears are incredibly similar. Even the chin and facial shape are disgustingly similar. Unfortunately, the person who originally made the Zodiac sketch was probably too high to include Cruz’s signature eyebrows. Not only that, but it’s well established that Cruz has an unsettling facial expression, making it look like he is permanently in a state of disgust, especially when he smiles. It’s not difficult to deduce – something is clearly bothering him in the back of his mind.
Of course, the most difficult codes to solve would be the ones that give away the identity of the killer. As well, the first 25 characters are able to be decoded to say “I, TED CRUZ, AM THE ZODIAC KILLER”.
Enough said.
4) He’s definitely a Reptilian Shapeshifter
Sites like The Washington Post claim there’s no way he could have committed the murders due to him being too young at the time of the murders. Unfortunately, those websites are easily paid off to ignore the existence of reptilians. I must ask, why would Ted Cruz’s campaign slogan be “TrusTed” if he didn’t have a scaly secret?
And let me reiterate… Look at that disgusted smile.

Moving on from Linkedin, I could not find many “popular” Linkedin accounts by myself as I’m not really connected in this industry. I guess I should attend a few more conventions and business meetings if I want to make more Linkedin connections. I’ll make this my new year’s resolution and update my blog post at a later date to give you more information about Linkedin users and accounts.
When it comes to the best bloggers in Colombia, there are many great ones to choose from. From fashion bloggers like Para Damas Oficial @paradamaslaoficial, to lifestyle and travel bloggers like Andrea Serna @andreasernafotos and GEF @geffrance, you’re sure to find the perfect blogger for your brand.

100,The Most Popular Youtube Channels in Colombia,https://abcnews.com.co/most-popular-youtube-channels-colombia/,"If you’re like me, you’re probably always looking for new stats and new things to learn, and today when I woke up, I wanted to find out what is the most subscribed Youtube channel in Colombia?
After about 2 hours of research and I found the answer to this question.
In my blog post below, I will personally share with you what is the most popular Youtube channel in Colombia:
Recently, Daniela Calle and María José Garzón have reached a major milestone for Colombian YouTubers; they are the first Colombian YouTubers to have 10 million subscribers on their joint YouTube channel,Calle y Poché. Their channel is extremely popular in Colombia, as well as throughout Latin America, and they have amassed an impressive following by creating entertaining and informative content such as bi-weekly vlogs, tutorials, challenges, and more.
They are proof that with dedication and effort, anyone can make it big on YouTube. Not only are they inspiring other Colombians to pursue their creative passions, but their success has also opened up the market for other influencers from Colombia.
I wonder if I could make it big on Youtube in Colombia if I put as much dedication and effort as these guys did? What do you think? Let me know your opinion in the comments below.
The Truth Commission of Colombia has also been using social media to spread their message of truth and reconciliation. They have a Facebook page that has been liked by more than 250,000 people and a Twitter profile with over thirteen thousand followers. Additionally, the Commission has a YouTube channel which hosts videos about their activities, events, and projects.
Through this channel, they have reached a wide audience and have been able to share more information about the issues related to the Colombian conflict. They have also collaborated with other organizations such as edding Argentina S.A., edding Colombia S.A. and edding Mexico S. de RL de CV in order to create more engaging content for their viewers. By utilizing social media platforms such as YouTube, they are able to reach a larger audience and spread their message of truth and reconciliation throughout the world.
I first learned about the truth commission when I moved to Medellin a few years ago. In my opinion, it’s a pretty convertial topic that should be only spoken of in private while you are with your friends. I suggest that you don’t talk about this in public like on the train or bus, as you could make some locals angry.
Besides the growing success of individual Colombian YouTubers, there are also several television channels in Colombia that have been taking advantage of YouTube’s vast platform. La Pulla, Cristovision, Sonríe TV, and Nosotros TV are the most-watched broadcasting channels in Colombia. Caracol and RCN are major broadcasting networks that have also been established on YouTube.
These channels offer a wide range of programming, from news and entertainment to movies and sports. For instance, Colombia’s two-time Olympic champion Mariana Pajon headlines her home event streamed live by Olympic Channel on Olympics.com and YouTube. With the rise of Colombian influencers, these television channels have seen a surge in viewership and popularity.
My personal favorite channels are the ones talking about fitness, nutrition, psychology and health. If you would like me to share my private Youtube playlist with you, please let me know in the comments section of this article and I will personally message you within 4 hours, I promise!
As YouTube, Instagram and Facebook have become increasingly popular in Colombia, content creators have been able to reach wider audiences with their content. Research has shown that influencers use crutches, idioms, and set phrases to identify with their audience. Additionally, Google Data indicates that YouTube recorded 30.4 million users in Colombia in 2022, indicating a large potential for advertising within the platform.
This has had a major impact on the Colombian media landscape as well as on the digital divide between different social groups in the country. Furthermore, Colombian authorities have also taken to using social networks such as Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Linkedin to share information. Therefore, it is clear that social media has had a profound effect on Colombian content creators and audiences alike.
I love the Colombian landscape by the way! That’s one of the main reasons why I moved to Medellin in the first place.
The rise of Colombian influencers and famous Colombian Youtubers has been nothing short of remarkable. From bloggers, to YouTubers, to Instagrammers, Twitter and Facebook influencers, the Colombian market has been booming with creative and innovative content. As more and more people turn to online platforms for entertainment, Colombian influencers have become an important part of the digital landscape.
It doesn’t matter how many subscribers they get, as some of them have small channels that give full access to tons of free useful information about fitness, health, nutrition and more. Personally, that is the main reason why I use Youtube daily: to learn more about these topics, which are my 3 favorite topics.
Not only do they provide entertainment, but they also offer valuable insight into the culture and trends of Colombia. Through their channels, they have been able to reach millions of viewers and have become some of the most popular and influential personalities in the country. This surge in popularity has led to a new wave of influencer marketing campaigns that businesses can use to reach a larger audience. With their help, brands can create campaigns that will resonate with the Colombian public, helping them build relationships and grow their business.
When it comes to marketing to the Colombian audience, it is important to understand the culture and the unique needs of each market segment. It is also essential to have an understanding of the platforms they use and the type of content they prefer. By leveraging data and insights from dunnhumby, the MVIS® Colombia Index (MVCOLX), and other sources, marketers can better understand the Colombian audience and create tailored strategies that will reach them in a meaningful and impactful way.
I am a market myself and I want to use all the data I found during my research to increase my sales for my personal business in Medellin. I am not a Colombian Youtuber, but I plan to hire a young journalist to create videos for me and share the profits of our Youtube channels. I’ll keep you updated once we get more video views on our account before January! Until then, you can find more info on our website showcasing the top Youtubers and an integration to your Youtube analytics via the Internet using new AI technology to get most subscribers to learn about you and your business.
By using social media platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram, marketers can build relationships with influencers and create content that resonates with their target audience. By utilizing these different tactics, marketers can reach their desired Colombian audiences in an effective manner.",0

105,The Most famous Facebook pages in Colombia,https://abcnews.com.co/most-famous-facebook-pages-colombia/,"Ah, good old Facebook!
I remember when I first learned about it back in 2004, and we were throwing “digital hot potatoes” at each other, my friends and I.
I can’t believe Facebook is still going strong!
Facebook is the most used social media platform in Colombia, and there are many popular Fcebook pages that you can visit to contact your favorite Colombian businesses.
Here’s a list of them below.
As a Colombian living in the 21st century, it is no surprise to hear that Facebook is the most popular social media platform in Colombia. According to Meta data, the social network has 35.15 million users, making it the top social media website in the country. Not only is Facebook the most widely used site, but it is also the most popular – 92% of Colombians said they visited Facebook last month, and 89% reported having used WhatsApp.
It is estimated that Colombians spend an average of 3 hours and 45 minutes on social media platforms. This proves that Facebook is an integral part of life for Colombians and that it is here to stay.
The popularity of Facebook in Colombia is driven by the need for family connections. Family groups are quite popular on the platform, with many users joining to stay in touch with their loved ones. Many families set up their own private chat groups on Facebook, allowing them to keep in contact with each other without having to go through the hassle of organizing a physical gathering.
Many Colombians also use Facebook to organize events and activities for their families, such as birthdays and anniversaries. This makes it easy for families to stay connected and celebrate special occasions together, even if they live far apart. Many parents use Facebook to help keep track of their children and ensure they are safe.
I. ama father myself, so I like to keep track of my daughter’s account to make sure she doesn’t speak to weird people too much on FB. There. aremany parental apps that can help you do that, if you want me to create a blog post listing those apps, please let me know in the comments below.
It is evident that Colombians love to stay connected on social media. As of February 2022, 57.2% of social media users in Colombia were women, less than 43% were men, and 33.1% of this group were aged 18-24 years old. Moreover, Filipinos spend an average of 4 hours and 15 minutes every day on social media, making them the worldwide leader in daily usage, followed by Colombia. This means that Colombians are spending a significant amount of time engaging with their favorite social media platforms and connecting with their peers online.
I stayed din Medellin for a few months last year and can confirm that many people use Family group accounts on Facebook to keep in touch with their relatives. I personally use Facebook messenger for that, but that’s just a matter a of personal preference, in my opinion.
When it comes to social media in Colombia, Facebook and WhatsApp top the list with over 90% of users having accounts. But what other popular platforms are available here? Well, YouTube is the most used social network in Colombia with 98 percent of active users accessing the platform. Instagram follows close behind with 77 percent of users regularly using it.
While Elempleo.com, Linkedin, Career Development Center (CTP) and Glassdoor are the most commonly used job boards both by companies and job seekers. With such a wide variety of popular platforms available in Colombia, it’s no wonder that social media use is so widespread here.
I also learned recently that TikTok is becoming very popular among young Colombian teens, so if you have. business that sells products to this demographic, you should listen to my advice and and use Facebook ads and Tiktok ads to promote your company.
As of February 2022, there are an estimated 35.15 million Facebook users in Colombia. The country has the lowest fixed broadband penetration among OECD countries, however, it still ranks first in Latin America when it comes to Facebook usage.
This is likely due to the fact that 92% of Colombians reported visiting Facebook last month and 89% reported using WhatsApp. These two social media outlets are hugely popular throughout the country, with 90% of internet users having an account on either or both.
Most social media users in Colombia are between 18-34 years of age and are active on platforms such as YouTube and Facebook. According to Meta’s advertising resources, women make up 57.2% of the Colombian Facebook user base, and 33.1% of this group are aged between 35-44 years old. Lastly, the typical user has ‘liked’ a median number of 8 pages on Facebook.
I learned that there are millions of Facebook users in Colombia from a documentary about FB that I watched on television last month.
Facebook is extremely popular in Colombia, with over 41 million users as of June 2022. This makes it the 8th largest user of Facebook in the world, and the largest user in Latin America. The popularity of Facebook in this country is due to a number of factors, including the fact that it’s easy to use and widely available.
Its integration with other social media platforms such as WhatsApp means that it’s often used as a platform for communication by many Colombians. As well as this, family and friends often use Facebook to stay in touch and share updates. With such a large user base, Colombia is an important market for businesses looking to advertise on the platform.
In my opinion, which is also backed u by real stats, the United States will always remain the country with the most active Facebook users, especially now that FB changes its name to Meta and they are investing heavily in VR tech for the future. I can’t wait to see what happens in a few years, it’s exciting!
Yes, Colombia does have Facebook and it is the fourth most popular social media platform in the country. According to Meta data, there are 35.15 million Facebook users in Colombia, which makes it the second largest user of Facebook in Latin America. In the 2016 plebiscite, Facebook reached an audience of 32 million Colombians on the Internet.
Whatsapp is ranked number 1 and is the most visited Social Media Networks website in Colombia in December 2022, followed by facebook.com as the runner up.
Oscar Fonseca, a professor in the Department of Communication and Information Technologies at the University of Antioquia, analyzed 100 Facebook profiles from Colombia and conducted 20 interviews. The graph shows that Android has 54.95%, Windows has 19.59% and IOS has 25.45% usage for social media in Colombia from Dec 2021 to Dec 2022. It is clear that Colombian people love their social media and have embraced it with open arms.
When meeting new people in Medellin, I found that whatsapp was the easiest way for me to exchange contact information, especially when I use the QR code scan function.
If you’re looking for the Latin American country with the most Facebook users, then look no further than Colombia. With 35.15 million users, Colombia is the second most popular country in terms of social media usage, behind only Guatemala.
Facebook and WhatsApp are by far the most popular social networks in Colombia, with over 90% of internet users having an account on either platform.
This makes Colombia one of the most active countries in terms of social media usage and internet usage in Latin America, and it’s no wonder why so many people are drawn to the platform. Whether you’re looking to stay connected with family and friends or to find new people to network with, there’s no better place to do it than Facebook!

106,5 Best Pinterest Boards in Colombia,https://abcnews.com.co/best-pinterest-boards-colombia/,"The first time I used Pinterest was when I was looking for decoration ideas to decorate my Colombian restaurant in Medellin.
It’s so easy to use and visually awesome, that I’m hooked on it daily now!
I recently did som research to find what are the best and most famous Pinterest boards in Colombia, and I want to share the results with you below.
Let’s get started!
When it comes to creating an art business, Pinterest is hands down the best platform for it. With the help of Pinterest, I can easily upload images of my own paintings, drawings, and sketches to my “My Art” board. This board is perfect for building my business page and allowing me to discover the best ideas and inspiration for Colombian art.
With this board, I can share and promote my art to gallery curators and art consultants. Additionally, I can use the description area to add links to my website or online store so that people can easily find and purchase my work. So if you want to create an art business, make sure you make the most out of Pinterest’s “My Art” board!
As a Colombian, I’m very proud of my culture and heritage. So it’s no surprise that I love to explore the Colombia Bulletin Board section on Pinterest. It’s full of amazing ideas for art, travel, and more. From After School Bulletin Board to Lp September Frame, Colombia Who Is My Neighbor, Bubba Keg and Oracion A San Antonio – you can find anything you need to celebrate Colombia! Even if you’re not Colombian or don’t live in Colombia, you can still appreciate the beauty of this board. You can find amazing content marketing ideas, design ideas, and architecture firms – it’s a great way to learn more about Colombia and its people.
I personally prefer to use the Art boards compared to the Bulletin boards, but that’s just my personal preference and you are free do take it or leave it in my opinion.
As a student, I love the idea of having a Colombia bulletin board in our classroom to celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month. After School, Bulletin Board, Lp, September, Frame are all great ideas for decorating and making our classroom more festive. We can use these items to create an eye-catching bulletin board that showcases all the different aspects of Hispanic culture and heritage. This will be something that we can look back on and remember for many years to come.
As someone who loves to explore and discover new places, I was particularly interested in discovering the best Pinterest boards dedicated to Colombia. After digging around, I found a board called “Colombia Who Is My Neighbor, Bubba Keg, Oracion A San Antonio” created by Prendese Bareto. This board is packed with amazing visuals of Colombia’s culture, from Catholic funeral homes in San Diego to May Festival 2013 San Antonio TX! I love this board because it’s a great source for discovering the country’s hidden treasures and attractions.
I also appreciate the variety of topics covered in this board, from Taganga full colombian movie to Queen Bee Taj Mahal Live. This board is a great source of inspiration for anyone looking to learn more about Colombia’s culture and history.
I found that the best thing about this board is the fact that it showcases pins from many different industries at once. that saves me time instead of having to browse through tons of different boards. I just glance at this board quickly while having my breakfast in the morning.
João Leitão’s Pinterest boards are the perfect way to get inspired for your next project. His Pinterest boards feature a variety of topics, from architecture firms to content marketing ideas. He also has a great selection of travel boards that showcase the best places to visit in Colombia. With João Leitão’s Pinterest boards you can easily find the inspiration you need for any project!
If you’re looking for amazing travel boards on Pinterest to find tips for your next trip to Colombia, then Beth Williams’ Pinterest boards are a great place to start. She has plenty of boards for world travel, USA travel, solo travel, digital nomads, family travel, and traveling specific countries. She also has a great list of the 50 best things to do in Colombia.
Her boards have plenty of tips of activities to do during your visit, as well as budget travel guides, and ideas on what destinations to explore. João Leitão’s Pinterest boards are also a great place to explore travel tips for Colombia. He has a board dedicated to Colombia which includes ideas for exploring the national parks and other top destinations.
Travel is one of my personal favorite hobby and passion, so I’m a big fan of this board as it gives me ideas to improve my own travel experience in Colombia and overseas as well.
As an artist, the best way to get inspired and find great ideas is to explore Pinterest boards. Every artist has their own unique style and preference, so it’s important to find the right boards that fit your needs. Through Pinterest boards, you can discover inspiring artworks from artists around the world and learn about different techniques and styles. In Colombia, there are plenty of great Pinterest boards for artists to explore.
From My Art, a board dedicated to showcasing self-created artwork, to João Leitão’s Pinterest Boards, which feature beautiful sculptures and paintings from the renowned artist. And don’t forget the Best Travel Boards on Pinterest which provide plenty of stunning photography from Colombia’s many breathtaking destinations. There’s something for everyone on Pinterest, so take some time and explore the best Pinterest boards Colombia has to offer!
I used to be an artist when I was younger, so this board reminds me of a lot of shows that we created and performed in the past and all the good times that I had in the process.
If you’re a content marketer looking for ideas, Pinterest is a great resource before you buy Pinterest ads for your Pinterest account on this social media platform or for your Pinterest profile or multiple accounts. From blog posts to social media posts and videos, there are hundreds of ideas to help you create valuable content for your customers. To get the most out of Pinterest, start by optimizing your pins and creating targeted ads.
I personally like to reach my target audience by creating blog posts showcasing stats for marketers in Columbia, just like the article that you are reading right now. I found that these articles attract a lot of free links from other blogs and it helps increase how many people see my blog posts and access my website or site at this link shown on the pictures.
When it comes to design ideas, Pinterest has an endless array of options. From interior design portfolios, to the best in Colombian Flag design, to the popular Architecture presentation board. I found a great example of the latter by Joanne Chan, which is an amazing visual representation of the creative possibilities that Pinterest offers.
Then there’s the Home Inspo board, a great resource for inspiration when it comes to decorating your home. And last but not least, Flag Gallery’s Colombian Flag board is perfect for finding ideas on how to display the colors of Colombia in your home. With so many great boards to explore, it’s no wonder why Pinterest is such a great source for design ideas!
Like I mentioned earlier in this blog post, I personally use Pinterest mainly to save pins about alibaba decoration products that I will buy by myself at a later date. I found that’s it’s an easy way to organize my ideas for the future.
For architecture fans looking to be inspired, I highly recommend checking out the Pinterest boards of some of Colombia’s top architecture firms. From modern, sleek designs to traditional and rustic styles, you’ll find plenty of ideas that you could use in your own projects and designs. João Leitão’s boards are especially noteworthy, as they showcase some of the most breathtaking and innovative designs from around the world. You can also take a look at Best Travel Boards on Pinterest for ideas on how to incorporate elements from different cultures into your architecture firm’s designs. Finally, don’t forget to check out Pinterest boards for artists, content marketing ideas, and design ideas for more inspiration.
As a content creator, creating boards aligned to Pinterest’s most popular categories makes good sense. Group boards, where you collaborate with other Pinterest users and you all have permission to add pins to a shared board, can help your pins reach a wider audience. With this in mind, let’s take a look at the best boards about Colombia on Pinterest.
From Kirsten Alana’s 15 Incredible Things To See And Do In Colombia board to Coffee Capsule Master Origin Colombia, there are plenty of inspiring boards to choose from. So whether you’re looking for travel inspiration, recommendations for food and drink, or just want to get creative with your next project, these boards can help you get started.
I’m not a coffee drinker myself, but I still had a quick look at this board while I was researching content for this blog post. It’s great board and I recommend that you check it out too!
As Pinterest grows in popularity, it is no surprise that the platform is seeing a major surge in users from Colombia. In the past year, the number of users from Colombia has been steadily increasing and is projected to reach 3 million by the end of 2022.
When it comes to popular searches on Pinterest, 97% of them are unbranded and consist of 2-3 word queries. This shows that the majority of consumers are looking for inspiration and ideas rather than specific products or services. In Colombia, the top trending searches on Pinterest include “christmas nails”, “popular categories”, “recipes”, “home ideas”, “style inspiration”, and “travel boards”. Moreover, a popular search within the last 30 days is Coffee Capsule Master Origin Colombia. With so many options available on Pinterest, it is no wonder why it has become one of the largest social media platforms in Colombia with an estimated 3.33 million users.
Of course, adult content will always remain the #1 search, but I noticed that the CEO of Pinterest actually blocks those searches to keep 100% of the content safe for work. Which is great in my opinion.
As one of the most renowned online communities for design products and materials, Architonic is quickly becoming a popular choice among Pinterest users. With over 8,000 followers and 617 boards, they have created a list of the 7 best Pinterest accounts to gain inspiration from various topics such as fashion, interior design, and travel. What’s more, they have acquired ArchDaily, the world’s most popular architecture project. With this acquisition, even more users are flocking to Architonic to gain insight into the world of design.
I recently came across some incredible travel boards about Colombia on Pinterest. If you’re looking for inspiration for your next trip to Colombia, then these boards are the perfect place to start. For example, Betty Bravo’s board offers stunning photos of Colombia’s incredible landscapes, Kirsten Alana provides helpful travel tips and itineraries for exploring the country, and Turismo Logo has an array of amazing souvenirs you could pick up on your visit. There’s plenty of inspiration out there to help make the most out of your trip to Colombia. Whether you’re looking for travel guides, photography ideas or simply browsing through Colombian markets, Pinterest is the perfect place to get started.
In conclusion, if you like traveling as much as I do, then you will also like Pinterest travel boards as much as I do, right? Check out the most famous influencers from Colombia.

As Josh Fischman mentioned, it is not possible to pop your eyes out if you keep your eyes open during a sneeze. But what about the pulverized dried tobacco leaves known as “snuff”? It was once popular for the stimulant effect delivered by a swift hit of snuff. However, now I think it is safe to say that LinkedIn is the new snuff.

108,"Ted Cruz: ""I Will Endorse Donald Trump For President If He Makes Masturbation Illegal"" – ABC News",https://abcnews.com.co/ted-cruz-to-endorse-trump-for-president-masturbation-illegal/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) — U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) sent shockwaves through the Republican Party today when he announced that he would endorse Donald Trump for President, but only if the GOP nominee would be willing to publicly support a ban on masturbation. The Senator called this ‘The single most important issue facing the country today’ and that without ‘swift action by the next President the country was doomed to slide down a slippery slope of debauchery and self-satisfaction’.
“Self-love is a silent killer in this country. This needless act of hedonistic indulgence is leading our children down a dark and destructive path. It starts innocently enough with a JC Penney catalogue or the Playboy centerfold tucked under your mattress, but it quickly spirals out of control, and before you know it, your mother has to call the coroner because you’ve died from auto-erotic asphyxiation.
I’m not saying that we lock up these one armed bandits and throw away the key; what we need is a compassionate approach that helps these deviants reform and become productive members of society. If Mr. Trump is willing to acknowledge the severity of the problem, and commit to finding real solutions, I will do whatever it takes to help him secure the White House in November. Should Mr. Trump decline, I think it’s safe to say that all options, including a third party run, are on the table.”
Donald Trump told ABC News that he was open to the idea, though he refused to take a clear stand.
“Look, do I think Senator Cruz is right about this? You know, maybe he is. To be honest, I don’t know a lot about taking care of your own business down there. I don’t need to. I’m an amazing lover, the best lover, and I literally have women lined up around the block to be with me. I could have any woman I wanted, so there is no need to for me to be grabbing at very large and not at all inadequate straws. But I do think this business about playing with your own business could have national security implications.
Lots of people are saying that our troops overseas are too busy battling the one-eyed monster to take care of the ISIS monster. So I do think this is something we really need to look at. My people still need to sit down with Ted’s people and sweat out the dirty details, but I’m hopeful that we can come together in a way that is mutually satisfying.”
This is not the first time that Cruz has attempted to use his political power to curtail the act of self-stimulation. As solicitor general of Texas in 2007 he fought to uphold the state’s ban on sex toys by arguing that there was no “right to stimulate one’s genitals.” Cruz eventually lost this battle, but the story re-surfaced this year and gained widespread media attention, prompting Cruz’s former college roommate Craig Mazin to tweet that Cruz’s stance against stimulating one’s own genitals was “a new belief of his”, implying that much of Cruz’s time in college was, in fact, spent stimulating his own genitals. Another one of Cruz’s former college roommates, Matt Daemon, has recently come forward to corroborate Mazin’s story.

“Ted Cruz was all about taking care of his own needs back then, which is fine, but he was always really creepy about it. It would be one thing if he was just rubbing one out in his room with the door closed, but I honestly lost track of the number of times I came home to find him sitting on the couch naked, with his penis fully erect, watching re-runs of Walker Texas Ranger. One time when I came home he was even holding a pair of my dirty boxers. I finally just got tired of it and moved out. It literally makes me sick to think about what kind of weird sex stuff that guy must be into. This is the last man who should be legislating people’s morality.”
Cruz’s ultimatum for Trump has also drawn the ire of Planned Parenthood which maintains that self-gratification is a “perfectly normal human behavior” which can play a significant role in reducing the number STIs and unwanted pregnancies.
“Ted Cruz’s policy proposals endanger the health and welfare of Americans of all ages” said the group’s spokeswoman Cassandra Schmidt. “It is unconscionable that a major presidential candidate would seriously consider such a ludicrous proposal.”
Ted Cruz, however, remains undeterred by his detractors. “When you churn Beelzebub’s butter or ring the devil’s doorbell you make the angels in heaven weep, and the angels are weeping for this country 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. America needs strong moral leadership, and I pray that Donald Trump is up to the task. The fate of our great nation is in his hands; hopefully, they’re big enough to handle it.”
Most pundits expect Trump to answer Cruz’s call and demand a stiffer approach to the matter.
A recent poll by the New York Times found that 43% of likely Trump voters support a ban on self-stimulation due to moral and religious concerns. Another 46% would be okay with a ban, saying that they, like Trump, have far too many potential suitors, and therefore do not need to satisfy their own urges. Only 11% of Trump supporters are against a ban.
RNC political strategist Paul Horner calls the move a “no-brainer” and says that Trump would be foolish to turn his back on Cruz.
“Conservatives are siding with Cruz overwhelmingly on this issue. If Donald does not side with the Senator, he risks alienating the party’s Christian base and opening the door for a third party run by Cruz which would fracture the vote and all but guarantee a victory for Hillary. Trump needs to take a clear stand and he needs to do it soon.”
Regardless of which side Trump takes on the issue, it is certain to invoke heated debate on both sides of the political aisle. You can voice your opinion about Cruz’s proposal by calling the Senator’s 24-Hour No Self-Love Hotline.

109,Bill Murray Kicks Off Presidential Campaign In South Carolina With A Bang – ABC News,https://abcnews.com.co/bill-murray-kicks-off-presidential-campaign-in-south-carolina-with-a-bang-abc-news/,"Charleston, SC — Just one day after the Democratic Primary, legendary actor, comedian, and writer, Bill Murray, brought his newly announced Presidential campaign to Charleston, South Carolina, speaking to an estimated crowd of over 100,000 cheering fans and supporters.
“Hello South Carolina! Are you ready to get weird or what?” Murray said to the roaring crowd.
Murray’s speech, which lasted a little more than an hour, touched on many issues from his campaign, including increased wages, health care, the cost of higher education and human rights in general. The rally also included wine tasting and stages where the people in attendance were allowed to sing karaoke.
“I saw the Republican debate the other night and it made me sick to my stomach,” Murray told the crowd. “Here are grown men, candidates running for President of the United States, and they’re acting like 4-year-olds. They’re up there on stage, broadcasted to the entire world, calling each other names, interrupting each other, making complete fools of themselves and I just thought to myself; I think the American people deserve better than this. I know we deserve better than this because we are better than this.”
Political analyst, Paul Horner, told ABC News he has taken an extreme interest in what Murray is doing since he announced his run for President just a little more than a week ago.
“I don’t know if Bill Murray is really running for President or if he’s just having some fun, but the man is making some excellent points out there. He’s getting people to think about the state their country is in right now and making a lot of people happy while doing it. I applaud Mr. Murray for what he’s doing.”
“I pretty much don’t like any of the candidates that are running for President right now,” Murray told the crowd, “I think Bernie Sanders seems like a decent guy, but the rest of em’, are pretty much complete pond scum in my opinion.” Murray continued, “I’m always traveling around the world, but I’m proud to call America, the good ole’ U.S. of A, my home. I think there’s a lot of great people here, a lot of potential, but there’s also a lot of confusion and hate right now. People don’t know what to make of these Hitler wanna-be’s like Donald Trump, and the Ted Cruz’s, who want to start World War III. They feed on the hate and paranoia a lot of this country has, and because of that, you see them leading in the polls. And it’s sad that people go along with it, and can’t see it for what it really is.”
Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she fully supports Murray and his run for President.
“We need a new face in Washington. Someone who has no political ties or agenda and can’t be bought,” Bradley said. “I actually met Bill Murray a while back when we were starting our cause that gives new socks to the homeless. Bill made a donation right there on the spot, saying what we were doing was amazing; he’s such a great guy. He truly cares about people and making the world a better place.”
Murray finished the rally by saying, “I’m no hero, I just want to help out, and I hope you all choose to stand behind me, or beside me, or wherever is comfortable for you, but just as long as it’s with me. Look, we don’t need to make America great again, because it already is; we all just need to try a little bit harder and have more love in our hearts for our fellow man. I think if you can take care of yourself and then maybe take care of someone else then that’s sort of how you’re supposed to live. Lets all help each other make this the best life experience possible!”
Murray still has yet to announce if he will be running as an Republican, Democrat or Independent.
David Mikkelson, founder of Snopes, a website that takes the fun out of stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing.
“This type of story, when it goes viral, and we debunk it, we make money,” Mikkelson said. “The secret behind a good Snopes article is a formula that we have used since day one, it’s actually quite simple. First, we start with the same cookie-cutter outline we use for every site that we debunk. Next, we copy and paste parts of the original article into ours. After that, one of our “writers” will type one or two sentences that talk about the content we just copy and pasted. And now, last but not least, we slap a title on there similar to the article’s headline that we’re debunking. This way it will show up at the top of Google for anyone searching for that story, and that’s it! Then we just sit back and let the money roll in. We are the absolute definition of clickbait! I’ll tell what, if it wasn’t for great writers like Internet news satirist Paul Horner, putting out the stories that he does, my children wouldn’t have been able to go to college.” Holding back tears, Mikkelson finishes by saying, “Though we are currently being sued by Fox News for calling them a “fake news site”, so lets just hope Paul Horner writes another story soon.”
Murray’s campaign team told reporters their next stop is the Arizona State Capitol on March 2nd and then the Tempe Improv later that night. It is rumored Murray will be at the Improv meeting with locals and telling a few jokes. Tickets to that show are only $10.",0
110,NBA Cancels 2017 All-Star Game In North Carolina Over Anti-LGBT Law – ABC News,https://abcnews.com.co/nba-cancels-all-star-game-in-north-carolina-lgbt-hb2/,"Charlotte, NC — NBA Commissioner Adam Silver held a press conference today, announcing that Charlotte, North Carolina will no longer be hosting the 2017 All-Star game due to the state’s recent passing of the anti-LGBT law HB2.
“With this new law in place, Charlotte currently does not have any anti-discrimination protection in place, something that would be vital for a large event such as the All-Star Game,” Silver told reporters. “We are giving the state of North Carolina 30 days to repeal this law or they can expect the 2017 All-Star game to be held elsewhere. I want to make it clear that the NBA will not stand for this type of intolerance and hate.”
Silver’s comments come just weeks after the North Carolina legislature passed HB2, the Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act, which requires transgender people (and everyone else) to use public restrooms according to the biological sex on their birth certificate. The new law also strips North Carolina workers of the ability to sue under a state anti-discrimination law, a right that has been upheld in court since 1985.
“If you were fired because of your race, fired because of your gender, fired because of your religion,” said Allan Freyer, head of the Workers’ Rights Project at the North Carolina Justice Center in Raleigh, “You no longer have a basic remedy.”
Since Governor Pat McCrory signed HB2 into law last month, well over 1,000 jobs have been moved out of state, and over 100 companies, including Facebook, Apple, Paypal, Pyramid Country and StopPack, have expressed concern or anger, warning they may move or cancel plans to expand, costing the state millions of dollars. In addition to that, by not hosting the 2017 NBA All-Star game, the state stands to lose even more. It is uncertain the exact figure, but in 2014, the All-Star game in New Orleans generated $106.1 Million and in 2015, New York generated approximately $195 million in economic activity.
On Friday, Bruce Springsteen cancelled his concert in Greensboro because of North Carolina’s controversial new LGBT bill stating, “With deepest apologies to our dedicated fans in Greensboro, we have canceled our show scheduled for Sunday, April 10th. Some things are more important than a rock show and this fight against prejudice and bigotry — which is happening as I write — is one of them. It is the strongest means I have for raising my voice in opposition to those who continue to push us backwards instead of forwards.”
Earlier this week, a women’s advocacy group, UltraViolet, began circulating an online petition urging Nike and PepsiCo — two chief sponsors of previous NBA All-Star weekends — to not support the 2017 event if it is held in Charlotte. There is also a new campaign in North Carolina encouraging people to call McCrory’s office every time they use a public restroom to report on their compliance with the law.
North Carolina has become a fierce battleground for culture war issues. Since the GOP captured the legislature in 2010 and the governorship in 2012, there’s been a steady stream of conservative changes, from much stricter voter laws to looser gun laws to overhauling taxes. The legislature even considered a proposal to establish Christianity as the official state religion.

Marina Mangiaracina, a transgender individual, who is a journalist for SB Nation, does not agree with the new law.
“First of all, no one carries around their birth certificate. How is a cop going to check what gender a person has on that document? Second of all, the policy of refusing to change the gender on your birth certificate until you have sex reassignment surgery is dangerous.
Not all trans people need, want, or can afford sexual reassignment surgery. It’s an extremely delicate and risky procedure that costs anywhere from $7,000 to $50,000. Not to mention all of the missed work in the weeks of recovery.
Forcing, or even encouraging transgendered people to have that surgery is sickening. If the person wants the surgery, that’s one thing. But not everybody can afford that surgery. It simply discriminates against the poor.”
Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, told ABC News that the new law needs to be repealed.
“This is a ridiculous law that makes absolutely no sense,”
Bradley said. “According to the law, a transgender man, a person with a vagina but has male features, such as a beard, now has to go into the women’s bathroom.
Then the police get called. How exactly do they verify what’s going on there? Does the transgender man have to drop his pants or is that person required to be carrying their birth certificate at all times? And according to the idiots behind this law, it’s about stopping sexual predators. How? Is it really that hard for a man to put on a wig and a Hillary suit and go into the women’s restroom?
No. This law is about bigotry, hate, intolerance and taking away human rights from the LGBT community.”
David Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, told ABC News that his wife Barbara is transgender.
“Stories like this have helped put my children through college, buy a new car, a home and even get the surgery my wife Barbara wanted; her name actually used to be Ted,” Mikkleson laughs, “We claim ‘to provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as well‘, but that’s just ridiculous. Do you know how much time that would take?
Instead, we just copy and paste parts of the original article into ours, write a couple sentences, and that’s it. I just want to be clear, our website does zero journalism or anything creative, and I’m only telling you this for legal reasons. For example, look at this article we wrote about Scientology supposedly losing its tax-exempt status. What is the name of the person or website responsible for the hoax?
We claim to know it, since we list the website’s disclaimer; but no real information is there. We even go as far as saying the site that started the story spreads malware and viruses, but we don’t say what website it is.
I think warning people about a website that could potentially destroy their computer is probably a good idea, and I hope one day to do that kind of ethical journalism, but that’s a lot of work and people will click our ads regardless, bottom line; so why do the extra work? And lots of people complain, but since we block archive.org it just becomes their word versus ours.” Mikkelson breaks down in tears, “Anyway, about my transgender wife Barbara; so brave.”
Paul Horner, owner of the Phoenix Suns, told ABC News he approves of the NBA’s decision but believes more should be done.
“I applaud the NBA in taking a stand against this type of discrimination and pulling the All-Star game from Charlotte. Furthermore, I believe it’s time for Charlotte Hornets owner Michael Jordan to take a stand against this law and move the team out of that backwards state.”
At this time, unless the North Carolina legislature repeals HB2, it is unclear where the 2017 All-Star game will be held.

111,Bill Murray Unwittingly Breaks Up Bank Robbery In Phoenix Arizona – ABC News,https://abcnews.com.co/bill-murray-unwittingly-breaks-up-bank-robbery-in-phoenix-arizona-abc-news/,"Phoenix, AZ — A bank robber was apprehended in Phoenix today after stopping to talk with none other than actor Bill Murray.
Phoenix Police Chief Tom Downey spoke with local news station ABC15 about the incident.
“The man we currently have in custody apparently had just robbed a Bank of America ATM machine, ran out, saw Mr. Murray walking on the sidewalk and stopped to talk to him. That’s when Phoenix Police were able to apprehend the suspect.”
Bill Murray, who is in town visiting friends, told ABC News about the incident.
“I saw this man on the sidewalk running towards me with a bag in his hand. Then he suddenly stopped when he saw me. He asked me if I was the zombie Bill Murray from Zombieland. I told him, ‘sure, why not’. Then he started telling me how much he loved me, and how that was his favorite movie. I was polite, I told him that was very nice of him to say. Then kind of out of nowhere, police showed up and tackled the man,” Murray said. “Some people might call me a hero, but I’m no hero. The real heroes today are the men and women of the Phoenix Police Department.”
37-year-old Phoenix resident Paul Horner was at the ATM when the robbery occurred.
“I was just standing behind this guy waiting my turn when suddenly he starts busting in the ATM with all these tools,” Horner said. “He gets the ATM open and fills a bag up with whatever cash was in the machine, then he runs out the door and down the street. It happened so fast for me to be scared or even get shaken up about it. Though what I am shaken up about is that Bill Murray is the one who stopped this guy and I didn’t get a chance to meet him.” Horner continued, “Bill Murray is my personal hero and today he was an actual hero for the city of Phoenix. What can’t that living legend do?”
Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she isn’t surprised by Murray’s heroics.
“Bill Murray is always doing something amazing,” Bradley said. “I actually met Mr. Murray a while back when we were starting our cause that gives new socks to the homeless. Bill made a donation right there on the spot, saying what we were doing was incredible; he’s such a great guy. He truly cares about people and making the world a better place.”
Murray told ABC News he will be in the Valley this week staying with friends and enjoying the sites.
“This week I plan on going to a couple things with friends and then on Wednesday will probably end up at the Tempe Improv. There’s a couple comics playing there that night that I’ve been wanting to see for a while now. I might tell some jokes if I feel like it, we’ll see. I really like bartending. Maybe they’ll let me do that. Regardless, it should be a fun time for everyone.”
The robber, whose name has not yet been released, was apprehended and taken into police custody. On his person police found a gun and a bag filled with an undisclosed amount of money.",0
112,Actor Bill Murray Announces 2016 Presidential Run – ABC News,https://abcnews.com.co/actor-bill-murray-announces-2016-presidential-run/,"Bill Murray shocked the country today announcing his run for President in 2016. (Dennis System, File) / AP Charleston, SC — From his home in Charleston, South Carolina, legendary actor, comedian, and writer, 65-year-old Bill Murray, shocked the country today by announcing that he will be running for President in 2016.
“I’ve been thinking about doing this for a while now, and you know, it just seems right,” Murray said. “I don’t like most of the candidates that are currently running for President. I mean, Bernie Sanders seems like a decent guy, but the rest of em’, are pretty much complete scum in my opinion.”
Murray continued, “I’m always traveling around the world, but I’m proud to call America, the good ole’ U.S. of A, my home. I think there’s a lot of great people here, a lot of potential, but there’s also a lot of confusion and hate. People don’t know what to make of these Hitler wanna-be’s like Donald Trump, and the Ted Cruz’s, who want to start World War III.
They feed on the hate and paranoia a lot of this country has, and because of that, you see them leading in the polls. And it’s sad that people go along with it, and can’t see it for what it really is. I think the American people are better than that and they deserve better.
I just feel if I didn’t step up and at least try and do something, I don’t know if I could sleep at night. Well, I would eventually fall asleep, I’m not an insomniac or anything. But it would keep me up, that’s for sure. Look, I’m no hero, I just want to help out, and I think I can do that by being President.” Murray finished by saying, “So I’m making it official, right here, right now; I Bill Murray am running for President of the United States in 2016.”

When reporters asked Murray his plans on improving America, Murray said, “I think we ought to be personally responsible. I think if you can take care of yourself and then maybe take care of someone else then that’s sort of how you’re supposed to live. I think we’ve sort of gotten used to someone looking out for us, and I don’t think any other person is necessarily going to be counted on to look out for us.”
So far it is unclear what political party Murray will be joining.
In 2012, Murray met Obama purely by chance at a basketball game – Murray never endorsed him. In fact, when asked about the Obama/Romney race happening that year, Murray said there really was not much difference between them.
“You know they both talk, they’re not so different really, you know if you shake them out, they’re not so different as people in what they say they believe it’s just whether or not they can get it done, and that requires finding that stuff, that real stuff, finding that presence of mind and spirit.”
When asked about his religious views, Murray told reporters, “Religion is the worst enemy of mankind. People can believe whatever they choose to believe, but it does not belong in politics. It imprisons your mind. Religion creates hate, racism, bigotry and keeps you from your true potential in life. No single war in the history of humanity has killed as many people as religion has. I imagine I probably won’t be too popular with the Christian vote in this country, but I’m fine with that,” Murray laughs.
Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she fully supports Murray and his run for President.
“We need a new face in Washington. Someone who has no political ties or agenda and can’t be bought,” Bradley said. “I actually met Bill Murray a while back when we were starting our cause that gives new socks to the homeless. Bill made a donation right there on the spot, saying what we were doing was amazing; he’s such a great guy. He truly cares about people and making the world a better place.”
Paul Horner, a spokesman for the campaign, told reporters that he believes in Bill Murray for President in 2016.
“We need a man like Bill Murray now more than ever. He is a man of the people. He’s charming, charismatic, intelligent, humble, caring and most of all, he’s honest. He has no scandals. He’s told no lies. The people love him and respect him, they believe in him. He’s a living legend and is exactly what America needs right now.”
Murray’s campaign team told reporters they will begin campaigning at the Arizona State Capitol on Wednesday, The Lost Leaf at 10PM on Thursday for their monthly Mystery Show to talk to the locals and maybe tell some jokes, and then all throughout Denver, Colorado on Friday.

113,Christian Anti-Masturbation Mascot Arrested For Public Masturbation At Japanese Embassy – ABC News,https://abcnews.com.co/christian-anti-masturbation-mascot-arrested-for-public-masturbation-at-japanese-embassy-abc-news/,"Los Angeles, CA — In an ironic twist of a fate, a mascot for a Christian anti-masturbation organization was arrested today for masturbating in public while at a protest being held at the Japanese Embassy in Los Angeles, California.
Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, whose real name is 37-year-old Paul Horner, was arrested at the Japanese Consulate after protesters notified police about a man running through their protest with nothing on except a dolphin mascot head while touching himself. Ironically the protest was over Japan’s annual dolphin drive held in the town of Taiji that kills thousands of dolphins a year. During Horner’s arrest, it was learned he was out on work release from the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility, where he is currently serving eight-years for his 4th arrest of public masturbation along with a charge of aggravated assault on a police officer.
Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she was at the protest when police arrived.
“It was really weird to see a naked man fondling himself and wearing a dolphin’s mascot head while running through a group of dolphin protesters,” Bradley said. “I thought maybe it was a stunt the protesters were doing to get more attention but I guess not.”
Tom Downey with the Los Angeles Police Department, who took Horner into custody, spoke with local news station KABC about the arrest.
“At first we thought he was possibly intoxicated or mentally unstable, ya know, talking about children and how deadly it is for them to masturbate. Telling us he was at the park with a Christian organization speaking to children about the dangers of masturbation. Saying things like, ‘They need to stop playing on the Devil’s playground, stop pounding their Devil stick and ringing the Devil’s doorbell’, we thought he was insane,” Downey said. “Turns out he actually was with this anti-masturbation organization who were accompanying a group of 3rd graders around the park when Horner left the children when he saw images of dolphins on the signs that these protesters were carrying. Mr. Horner said he was ‘aroused’ by all the pictures of dolphins. We further learned that Mr. Horner has four previous arrests for public masturbation, all while employed by this anti-masturbation organization.”
Horner, along with his organization, Stop Masturbation Now, recently finished a federally funded 31-city nationwide school tour which they claim focused on educating children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation.
Lonnie Childs who is president and founder of Stop Masturbation Now spoke with reporters about the future of the organization after this recent setback.
“Thanks to your tax dollars, Fappy has helped tens of thousands of children learn to live a masturbation-free lifestyle. During his countless visits to schools around the world, Fappy has collected thousands of signatures from children promising to never masturbate; he has done amazing things,” Childs said. “It is a shame how the media is portraying Fappy right now. Paul Horner is a great man. He is passionate about his work, he loves being Fappy and he especially loves the kids. They even have a nickname for him; they call him the tickle monster. But now, all of that is possibly ruined by some trumped-up charges by the Los Angeles five-oh, such a shame.” Childs continued, “These lies about Fappy sicken me to my very core. The employees who supposedly observed the incident in question need to be investigated. What is their motive? Are they masturbators? Are they agents of Big Masturbation? What are their crimes? These are the questions that must be addressed. Furthermore, we have found that, over the years, the only thing that Fappy “beats” are all the fraudulent charges brought against him. I have activated my prayer app and I ask that each and every one of you to keep Fappy in your prayers until this misunderstanding is resolved.”
40-year-old Phil Freedom, who was there protesting at the Japanese Embassy, witnessed the act in question.
“This man just started running around, naked, furiously masturbating and yelling something about how great Donald Trump was. He then put on this dolphin mascot head and attempted to hump one of our protest signs that had an image of a dolphin on it. It was absolutely horrifying.”
On the group’s Facebook page, news was posted of the arrest.
“All my faithful Fappy followers, I have some extremely bad news to report. I want you to hear it here first before the liberal media hate machine and Big Masturbation spread their lies about this incident. Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, whose real name is Paul Horner, an inmate at the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility, was out on work release in Los Angeles, California this morning. Fappy, as usual, was educating elementary school children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation. Somehow he got separated from the group and joined up with a dolphin protest at the Japanese Embassy there. It is “reported” by “police” that he took off his mascot costume and began running around naked while touching himself. Our lawyers tell us he is being charged with public masturbation, resisting arrest and disorderly conduct. He is currently being held at the Los Angeles Central Jail until a bond is set by a judge, this happening hopefully soon. These are obviously lies, but until we have all the information, please don’t jump to any conclusions. Please keep Fappy in your prayers during this difficult time. Praise Fappy!”
Horner’s attorney, Katie Glacier, told ABC News that the dolphin mascot is innocent of these crimes but will continue teaching masturbation prevention while in prison.
“Horner is in good spirits and patiently waiting to see a judge for his bond hearing,” Smith said. “Horner told me he is innocent, but if found guilty, says he will put an end to inmate masturbation in every jail and prison across the country, starting with the one he is currently serving time at. I personally was not aware of this information about the penal system, but it seems jail is just a hotbed for self-rape and immoral acts. Horner is a saint, a hero, a prophet, and a savior to all the lost heathenish souls out there with deadly masturbation addictions.” Glacier continued, “This may be his fifth arrest for masturbating in public, and may be currently serving an eight-year prison term for the same crimes, but that doesn’t mean he’s guilty this time. If Donald Trump was President, this wouldn’t have happened, or if it did, Fappy would be immediately pardoned. I guess at this time, all I can ask is that you please keep Fappy in your prayers during these difficult times.”
Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin and Stop Masturbation Now are federally funded programs designed to teach children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation. For more information or if you would like the group to visit your child’s school call.",0
114,BREAKING: Capitol Hill Shooter Identified as Right Wing Extremist – ABC News,https://abcnews.com.co/breaking-capitol-hill-shooter-identified-as-right-wing-extremist/,"Capitol Hill, where a white supremacist carried out an attack, injuring a police officer
WASHINGTON DC – On Monday afternoon, an extremist carried out an attack on Capitol Hill, shooting and injuring a police officer. The man has been identified as Thomas Finnigan, a white supremacist from Maryland. He has been taken into police custody, although currently Capitol Hill, including Congress and and the White House, remain on lockdown.
When the attack was carried out, Finnigan was described by eyewitnesses as trying to leave the visitor’s center, and advance further into either the library, Supreme Court, or even the White House.
“All I heard was ‘[expletive removed] Obama! [expletive removed] liberals and ISIS! Make America great again!” John Burke, a college student visiting the visitors center stated to ABC News. “Then we heard gun shots and were immediately instructed to leave the building.”
Thomas Finnigan is a 32 year old white supremacist linked towards having a strong affinity for Republican frontrunner Donald Trump on his Facebook. He grew up in a lower class family in Tennessee, and later moved to Maryland. Not much else is known about the shooter.
“It’s concerning, how some of our own born-and-bred American citizens are turning into terrorists over political unrest,” ABC political analyst Ana Cuddy said. “While in my own opinion, I must say I take no issue with the conservatives of the United States in general, this is not the first time a Donald Trump supporter specifically has carried out violent acts towards other members of the population. It is concerning to see how the Republican party has radicalized, and I hope the United States of America can learn its lesson from the treacherous acts Trump incites in our citizens.”
UPDATE 4:00 PM EST: The lockdown has been lifted according to Capitol Police.
UPDATE 4:37 PM EST: According to Capitol Police, no officer was shot. However, two tourists were injured by shrapnel.

B. About FoxNews.com.co
FoxNews.com.co is a parody website.
The Respondent has six other parody news sites. The Respondent uses FoxNews.com.co to post articles that would be absolutely ridiculous for the real FoxNews.com to publish. The articles on FoxNews.com.co mock Fox News, making the articles & website all that more hilarious, satirical and parody.
Since being registered only back on 1/13/16, FoxNews.com.co cannot be judged for its lack of content since the site is so new and the Respondent is the only author.
Besides the Respondent’s few articles, the rest of the site is just the theme which came default, filled with pages and posts in Latin (also default). Proving the point that foxnews.com.co is just ridiculous and parody, and no one, after viewing those pages in Latin would believe this is owned by a multi-billion dollar company such as Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation.
The popular online website Reddit.com classifies articles posted by foxnews.com.co as “satire”. See Exhibit 19.
Christian Anti-Masturbation Mascot Arrested For Public Masturbation
by u/paulbonerville in atheism
Respondent’s articles are written in English, or Latin on pages that came with the theme of the website as default, and the .com.co extension is from Columbia. In addition to that, according to Snopes.com, if a domain name ends with a .com.co extension at the end, it is a parody website.
Respondent’s disclaimer that is at the bottom of every page is parody. It claims that Fox News is proudly owned by Dr. Paul Horner. The complaint phone number listed, that the site encourages people to call, is for the Westboro Baptist Church. It also talks about treating those seeking help for “self-rape” and to get off the Devil’s playground with the assistance of an anti-masturbation dolphin named “Fappy”. See Exhibit 8.
Because of this, the entire site is clearly satire and covered under fair use parody laws.
1. Respondent’s SUPPOSED Infringing Activities and Bad-Faith Acts with FoxNews.com.de
Respondent responded to Complainant’s request to transfer the name on 8/5/15. See Exhibit 18.
The Complainant did not respond to the email, instead they went directly to the Registrar and took the name by force; this was told to the Respondent by 101domains.com. Fox took the domain name foxnews.com.de without permission from the Respondent. Just like FoxNews.com.co, FoxNews.com.de had content that was made up entirely of parody and satire.
2. Complainant claims that the Respondent seeks to financially benefit from foxnews.com.co by offering to sell the Domain Name for $699 on the domain-marketplace website Sedo
Sedo listed my domain name for sale without my permission. I have never offered to sell foxnews.com.co and have no intentions to sell it in the future, with Sedo or anyone else. In fact, this problem with Sedo is so common that they list this information on their website as a common question:
Why do I see my domain listed for sale on Sedo when I have not listed it for sale?
https://sedo-us1.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2282/~/why-do-i-see-my-domain-listed-for-sale-on-sedo-when-i-have-not-listed-it-for
I used their form to have foxnews.com.co removed from their website. See Exhibit 4.
I received a reference number #160331-001745. See Exhibit 5.
I also received email confirmation. See Exhibit 6.
On March 31st, 2016 I received email confirmation that their unauthorized listing for the sale of my domain name will be removed within 24 hours. See Exhibit 7.
Following up on March 3rd, 2016: A quick check of the page that Sedo previously had my domain name listed for sale is no longer there. Their unauthorized attempt at selling my domain name without my permission has been removed. See Exhibit 9.
3. FoxNews.com.co is protected under fair use of copyrighted works and parody laws
Parody: An imitation of the style of a particular writer, artist, or genre with deliberate exaggeration for comic effect.
Fox News and their trademark is for:
“ENTERTAINMENT SERVICES IN THE NATURE OF TELEVISION NEWS PROGRAMMING”. See Exhibit 21.
FoxNews.com.co is an online website with articles that are satirical, mocking Fox News using parody.
The fair use of copyrighted works for purposes such as criticism or comment is not an infringement of copyright.
The idea of fair use reflects copyright law’s careful consideration of First Amendment principles, as fair use permits later authors “to use a previous author’s copyright to introduce new ideas or concepts to the public.”
Previous domain name and court cases won over parody:
1. CFA Properties, Inc. v. Domains By Proxy, LLC and John Selvig Case No. D2012-1618 2. Beck v. Eiland-Hall 3. See eg, Elsmere Music, Inc v. National Broadcasting Co., 482 F. Supp. 741, 747 (S.D.N.Y. 1980), aff’d, 623 F.2d 252 (2d Cir. 1980) (finding Saturday Night Live’s use of “I Love Sodom” to be protected parody of “I Love New York”).
4. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. wallmartcanadasucks.com and Kenneth J. Harvey Case No. D2000-1104
In the case of Fox News Network, LLC, v. Penguin Group (USA), Inc., and Alan S. Franken, Judge Chin said the case was an easy one (siding for Franken), and chided Fox for bringing its complaint to court. The judge said, “Of course, it is ironic that a media company that should be fighting for the First Amendment is trying to undermine it.”
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_v._Franken
4. The stories published on FoxNews.com.co are not confusing to stories FoxNews.com would publish
The Respondent believes that Fox and its website FoxNews.com are pure evil. It is the Respondent’s opinion that they are the absolute definition of dumbing down the human race, accepting the idea to not question authority, religion, a police state, spreading hate and ignorance and the worse thing that has happened to mankind since the Bubonic plague. Respondent’s website FoxNews.com.co mocks this evil incarnate with parody.
The Respondent has only owned foxnews.com.co since 1/13/16, and in that time has published articles showing proof that Ted Cruz is the Zodiac Killer, how Fox News is NOT ‘fair and balanced’ as they claim, and other stories Fox News would never publish. FoxNews.com.co cannot be judged for its lack of content since the the site is so new and the Respondent is the only author.

5. Anything that was done with a federal court and two UDRP Panelists in the past has nothing to do with this case.
The Complainant argues that things the Respondent did 15+ years ago with Amazon and Microsoft are somehow relevant to this case.
This case is about the rights that fall under fair use parody laws. Those cases the Complainant includes in their filing has nothing to do with parody laws. With that being said, everything they say about the Respondent, those two UDRP decisions and a court ruling in federal court are irrelevant.
6. Fox News is commonly mocked and parodied
As owner of foxnews.com.co, Respondent is not the first to be a part of a much larger group that mocks Fox News with parody for its lack of fact-checking, mixing politics and religion, its far right-wing agenda etc.
In fact, back in October of 2013, Fox News aired a story on Live television that was written by the Respondent while writing for the parody website NationalReport.net. The story was about President Barack Obama using his own money to keep a Muslim museum open during the government shutdown.

http://www.rawstory.com/2013/10/kimmel-lampoons-fox-news-for-falling-for-muslim-museum-hoax/

If the websites mentioned above are not to your liking, a simple Google search of “Fox News Lies”, “Faux News” or “Fox News sucks” will provide hundreds of other articles and websites.
7. Digital Privacy Corporation
The Complainant says the Respondent is associated with the ‘Digital Privacy Corporation’. This is the private registration that is used by 101domains.com, the company foxnews.com.co was purchased through. The Respondent has no options when it comes to private registration when buying domain names through 101domains.com.The Respondent only mentions this fact if this somehow has anything to do with the decision made by the National Arbitration Forum and the panelist deciding this case. See Exhibit 20.
CERTIFICATION Respondent certifies that the information contained in this response is to the best of the Respondent’s knowledge. REMEDIES AND REQUESTED RELIEF Respondent requests that the domain name FOXNEWS.COM.CO not be transferred to Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation and the Respondent continues ownership.

116,Lionel Messi to sue Spanish newspaper over tax evasion claims in Panama Papers – ABC News,https://abcnews.com.co/lionel-messi-to-sue-spanish-newspaper-over-tax-evasion-claims-in-panama-papers/,"Lionel Messi is due to appear in court soon along with his father over separate tax evasion charges Alex Caparros/Getty Images
Lionel Messi is planning to sue a Spanish newspaper for defamation after the footballer was linked to tax evasion projects in the Panama Papers leak.
The captain of the Argentina national team was accused by El Confidencial of “setting up a tax fraud network” by using Panamanian company Mega Star Enterprises to avoid paying tax on image rights deals.
Mr Messi is due in court along with his father Jorge Messi on 31 May over separate tax evasion charges.
El Confidential produced documents appearing to show both Lionel and Jorge Messi’s signatures acquiring the shell company Mega Star Enterprises via an Uruguayan company.
The Barcelona forward and his father bought the company a day after being indicted by Spanish fiscal authorities investigating an alleged €4.1 million in unpaid taxes.
The offshore company is not mentioned in the Spanish government’s 2014 and 2015 indictments against the pair.
Mr Messi’s father took over sole ownership of the company in December 2015.
They are expected to issue a statement over the veracity of the claims.
The Panama Papers represent the biggest data leak so far, with more than 11.5 million documents held by the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca being passed to the German newspaperSeddeutsche Zeitung, which shared them with 107 media organisations around the world.
They reveal links between 72 current or former heads of state and 140 politicians.

117,"Bill Murray Performs Heimlich Maneuver, Saves Life Of Choking Man – ABC News",https://abcnews.com.co/bill-murray-saves-life-of-choking-man/,"Phoenix, AZ — In a scene straight from the movie Groundhog Day, Bill Murray saved the life of a man who was choking while dining at a popular steakhouse in Phoenix, Arizona today.
Murray was enjoying a meal at Meritage Steakhouse with friends when a man three tables from him began to choke on his food.
“I saw this guy choking, so I went over and helped him out,” Murray said. “I actually learned the Heimlich maneuver while working on the movie Groundhog Day. I’m glad I was able to get some good use of that skill outside of the movies.”
37-year-old, Paul Horner, told ABC News what happened.
“I guess I just took too much of a bite of streak because suddenly I couldn’t breath and started choking. My wife says I started to turn blue, and the next thing I know, none other than Bill Murray is giving me the Heimlich maneuver,” Horner says. “It was an amazing experience and he is such a good person. I offered to pay his tab and the party he was with, but he wouldn’t let me. He did say I could buy him a drink though, so that’s what I did. He then ate one of my french fries and told me, ‘no one will ever believe you‘.”
Tom Downey, who witnessed the incident, told local news station ABC 15 about the day’s excitement.
“This man started choking, so without hesitation, Bill Murray got up from his table, ran over to this gentleman and immediately started giving him the Heimlich. While everyone else in the restaurant was wondering what to do, Murray stepped up and saved the day,” Downey said. “It was surreal and absolutely amazing. It was great to meet Mr. Murray, what a cool guy.”
Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she isn’t surprised by Murray’s heroics.
“Bill Murray is always doing something amazing,” Bradley said. “I actually met Mr. Murray a while back when we were starting our cause that gives new socks to the homeless. Bill made a donation right there on the spot, saying what we were doing was incredible; he’s such a great guy. He truly cares about people and making the world a better place.”
Murray told ABC News he will be in the Valley this week staying with friends and enjoying the sites.
“This week I plan on going to a couple things with friends and then on Wednesday will probably end up at the Tempe Improv again. There’s a couple comics playing there that night that I’ve been wanting to see for a while now. I might tell some jokes if I feel like it, we’ll see. I really like bartending. Maybe they’ll let me do that. Regardless, it should be a fun time for everyone.”",0
118,New McDonald’s In Scottsdale Run Entirely By Robots – ABC News,https://abcnews.com.co/new-mcdonalds-in-scottsdale-run-entirely-by-robots/,"A McDonald’s restaurant in Scottsdale, Arizona is employing nothing but robots to run its daily operations and entire workforce. (AP Photo/Dennis System) Scottsdale, AZ — After seeing a decline in earnings for the first time in nine years, McDonald’s has begun to do something no other restaurant of its kind has ever done before; open stores run entirely by robots.
The store is set to open May 1st in Scottsdale, Arizona once the state-of-the-art robot remodel is complete. The restaurant will still employ a small team of human employees to insure all of the robots are working correctly, the food and cleaning supplies remain stocked along with removing the money collected by the robots. Visitors to the restaurant will see these new robots working in harmony at a speed of 50 times faster than the average McDonald’s employee, with no chance of error. The reason for the new robot-run-store in Scottsdale is the success of their Phoenix restaurant that opened back in July that is also run entirely by robots.
“I just love the robots at that McDonald’s in Phoenix,” 38-year-old Brian Mullan said. “I tell the robot what I want to eat, I then put money in their little robot hands, and within minutes, a cute little robot is bringing me out my food. They’re way better than humans, plus I don’t like people to begin with. They should just burn this whole system down and rebuild, but until that happens, I sure do like the robots at McDonald’s.”
The Scottsdale store’s new manager, Peter Gibbons, told ABC News that he has worked with the robots at a product development facility in San Francisco for the last six months and speaks highly of the machines.
“These things are great! They get their work done in a fast and orderly manner, plus they don’t ask for cigarette breaks.”
37-year-old Paul Horner, a spokesman for McDonald’s told reporters that because of the demand for a $15/hr minimum wage, the company has been playing with the idea of a restaurant run entirely by robots for years and believes their “McRobots” are the answer.
“With the high demand for a minimum wage of $15/hr and the protests getting worse every day, this is something we had to implement. Plus with the tremendous margin of human error, poor hygiene, lack of education, laziness, as well as the recent advancements in artificial intelligence it just make sense to automate our restaurants now rather than later.”

Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate in Arizona with brand new socks told ABC News that she approves of a $15/hr minimum wage increase.
“We see so many homeless people that work 40 hours a week, and that is just ridiculous,” Bradley said. “I think anyone not being claimed on someone else’s taxes deserves to make at least $15/hr. Some people just don’t have the physical or mental capability to get better jobs or go to college. I think in a country as great as ours, it is just sad that there are so many adults working 40 hours a week that have to worry about putting a roof over their head and food in their belly.”
Local Phoenix resident, 52-year-old Tom Downey, who has been unemployed for the last 3 years, was excited about the opening of a nearby McDonald’s until he heard about the robots.
“Now that they hire only robots, I don’t know what I can even do. I don’t have an education, a car, and now I’m not gonna even be able to get a burger job. Just the thought of having to go to the state unemployment office and stand in line with those scumbags!”
42-year-old Milton Waddams, an unemployed fast food worker, told reporters he is extremely disappointed by the decision to employ only robots instead of humans.
“The McDonald’s had my resume, I had already completed two job interviews there and they said I was scheduled to work once the new store opened and said they would return my phone call but they never called,” Waddams said. “I need a job I said, and I was told by Betty in HR that they have my resume on file, but they never called, and Sandra told me to talk to Bill, and then I hear of the robots instead of regular humans and that’s not what I asked for. And I need the job I told them, but there’s robots, so now I’m going to have to find another place of employment. And they were big giant robots, and I said no, no robots at McDonald’s. I could set the building on fire.”
Former grill cook, Tom Smykowski, from the original Phoenix McDonald’s location before it was shutdown for robot repairs and upgrades, is still mad about losing his job.
“You know there are people in this world who don’t have to put up with all this?” Smykowski told FOX News. “You see, that’s what you have to do. You have to use your mind and come up with some really great idea like that and you never have to work again,” but Smykowski’s friendly attitude suddenly turns to anger, “Well-well look. I already told you: I dealt with the go*damn employees so the customers would get the correct order. I have people skills; I am good at dealing with people. Can’t you understand that? What the hell is wrong with you people?”
Horner said he is excited to pave the way to a more automated workforce, hence a more reliable and affordable one.
“Robots are the future of McDonald’s in the United States and around the world,” Horner said, “Human workers want more pay and this has created giant protests which need our attention now before it is too late. Robots will decrease prices, increase productivity and make for better food.” Horner continued, “Human beings were not meant to stand and make burgers all day, filling out useless forms and listening to eight different bosses drone on about about mission statements. Now I’ve had a chance to meet with some of these robots, and boy, they are just straight shooters with upper management written all over them.”
The new robot McDonald’s will be located on the Southwest corner of Camelback and Miller. McDonald’s says that if the store is a success, 25,000 more robot-run restaurants will be built in the next three years. It is still unclear at this time what the robots look like or how customers will complete transactions as this information is being kept under strict confidentiality, but come July these questions will be answered. Will it be the right or wrong decision for McDonald’s? In the end, it will come down to what is best for the shareholders and the customer. The employees hoping to make $15/hr so they can afford basic human needs such as shelter and food; it looks like they will have to wait in line.
If you have any further questions about the robot-run establishment, McDonanld’s has setup a 24-hour robot hotline.

119,Vince Gilligan Announces Breaking Bad Season 6; Returns This Summer – Walt Did Not Die! – ABC News,https://abcnews.com.co/vince-gilligan-announces-breaking-bad-season-6-returns-this-summer/,"Series creator, Vince Gilligan, has announced that Breaking Bad Season 6 has begun shooting and says the show will be returning sometime this summer. (AMC Photo/Dennis System)
Hollywood, CA — Breaking Bad fans around the world are celebrating the stunning, glorious and amazing news that was announced today: Walter White is not dead, and there will indeed be a sixth season of the wildly-popular, award-winning AMC drama.
This shocking and exciting news comes not from an internet message board or the rumor mill but from series creator Vince Gilligan. In an exclusive ABC News interview, Gilligan dropped the bombshell.
“Walter White is not dead, and neither is Breaking Bad,” said the 48-year-old writer, director, and executive producer of the groundbreaking show.
“We’ve kept it under wraps for months, now the cat’s out of the bag. Season 6 is coming, and it’s going to be epic and true to the fans that have followed the show so incessantly.”
Gilligan explained his decision to continue with the popular series.
“I just couldn’t walk away from it. This isn’t a cash-grab or a sophomoric attempt to bastardize what was such a beautiful ending to season 5. I’ve invested so much of myself in these characters that I’d always had an inkling I’d return to it, even outside [the] Better Call Saul [spin-off]. The kicker was I’d need a spark, something that made it make sense for these stories to continue.”
The series star Bryan Cranston seemed to drop a major hint in an interview with CNN’s Ashleigh Banfield back in May. Asked by Banfield if his character, Walter White, died or not, Cranston said, “Hey, you never saw bags zip up or anything. Or say … you know.”
Gilligan explained how the decision came about to do a season six.
“Bryan [Cranston] called me up and said he had this incredibly lucid dream in which Walt wakes up in a hospital bed surrounded by the DEA, ends up breaking out of prison and finds out he’s got fans,” Gilligan said. “This isn’t a redemption story, it’s got a bleak, dark premise. I can’t give away any more of the details, but let’s just say Walt has quite a bit of unfinished business to attend to, and it sure as hell has nothing to do with teaching high school science.”
According to Gilligan, the entire cast agreed to return for at least one more season. This includes Bob Odenkirk, star of Better Call Saul, the prequel comedy series with season two beginning February 15th.
“I’m not surprised in the least that Vince was going back to Breaking Bad,” said Odenkirk. “Before we began shooting this new season, I was working with him on the set, and the last few times I had seen him, he had sort of a glint in his eye, a bounce to his step. He was laughing at a bunch of jokes I couldn’t pull off two years ago. I mean, comedy and drama can be radically different, and no one does drama like Vince. Season 6 will be great, I just know it, and I can’t wait to see where this journey takes us.”
Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that gives new socks to the homeless and those less fortunate, told ABC News she is excited that Gilligan will be featuring the group in the upcoming season.

“I’m just thrilled that Vine [Gilligan] is using our name and group in season six of Breaking Bad,” Bradley said. “We have so many great scenes and dialogue in season six, it is so fantastic. This will definitely increase the amount of donations we receive and put so many more brand new pairs of socks on the feet of homeless people. Please give what you can, every dollar puts at least one new pair of socks on the foot of someone less fortunate.”
David Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, upon hearing the announcement by Gilligan confirmed the news with ABC News.
“Yes, it’s true. I have a friend, Tom Downey, who is a writer for the show who told me everything. You don’t know how much of a relief this is to finally get this off my back. I’ve been keeping this a secret for six long months now, I was ready to explode,” Mikkelson said. “Here’s a little spoiler for all you fans out there so stop reading right now if you don’t want any information, otherwise, lets go. Season six begins with Walt waking up in the hospital, handcuffed to his bed.
Like Bryan [Cranston] said last May, nobody ever saw a body bag, so essentially, the last episode of Season 5 was left open-ended. Skyler, Walt Jr., Marie… none of them have any idea he’s survived, but the DEA is right on top of it. We’ll go through the motions of people finding out he’s alive – many people wanted Walt dead, so there’s a lot of disconcerted, angry people out there.
We have Walt going to trial, his incarceration and how he’s keeping Heisenberg and the blue meth on the streets during his imprisonment. Season 6 will have Walt’s eventual breakout, despite the fact that he’s being held prisoner in a fashion not seen since Hannibal Lecter. The nationwide manhunt for Jesse Pinkman is both epic and gripping, and I can tell you for certain his relationship with Walt will continue, in a much more strained, arch-nemesis-type fashion.
None of this is anything you won’t find out about in the trailer, but it’s high time to get truly, truly excited for the greatest show of all time! I believe in this, it’s a valid and worthwhile continuation of something that deserves discernment and care. Breaking Bad Season 6! It’s not over yet!”
For comedic relief in season 6, a Christian anti-masturbation organization’s mascot named Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin will be joining the crew. Fappy, played by newcomer 37-year-old Paul Horner from Phoenix, Arizona, told ABC News he is excited about the role.
“I’m not familiar with the show, honestly if it’s not in the Bible I probably haven’t heard about it,” Horner said. “A couple months ago, the great Lonnie Childs, president of Stop Masturbation Now, contacted me and asked if I wanted to be in one of those moving picture shows about breaking stuff badly and smoking methamphetamine.
I told him I had never tried meth before, but the people at the bus stop look like they’re having a good time. I also told him I was interested in the part, but just as long as the breaking show had no self-rape or homogayness in it.
He assured me it didn’t, so I said, sure, why not!” Horner continued, “I think this is a perfect platform to help spread awareness about the dangers and consequences of masturbation. This is going to be so much fun! Praise Lonnie Childs! Praise Fappy!”
The original series won multiple awards, including ten Primetime Emmys. Out of 267 nominations, Breaking Bad has garnered 101 trophies. Breaking Bad: Season 6 is set to return sometime this summer.

Carlson also took the opportunity to slam the ‘corrupt gatekeeping’ of legacy media and hinted at being able to “tell stories” from his 30 years of experience in the MSM.
“At the most basic level, the news you consume is a lie,” said Carlson on Twitter Tuesday afternoon. “A lie of the stealthiest and most insidious kind… you are being manipulated.”
Watch:
We’re back. pic.twitter.com/sG5t9gr60O
Carlson went on to explain how there are limits to telling the truth on cable news.
“There are always limits. And if you bump up against those limits often enough, you will be fired for it,” said Carlson. “That’s not a guess – it’s guaranteed. The rule of what you can’t say defines everything.”
“Starting soon, we’ll be bringing a new version of the show we’ve been doing for the last six-and-a-half years to Twitter. We’ll bring some other things too which we’ll tell you about.

2,Trump To Appeal After Jury Finds Liable For ‘Sexual Abuse’,https://www.infowars.com/posts/trump-to-appeal-after-jury-finds-liable-for-sexual-abuse/,"(Update 1605ET): Trump’s attorney, Joseph Tacopina, told the Epoch Times that the former president is planning to appeal the verdict which found him liable for battery and defamation charges in the E. Jean Carroll trial.
During the closing argument on Monday, Tacopina doubled down on his statement that Carroll’s case was motivated by political reasons, a claim that Carroll’s attorneys denied.
“What E. Jean Carroll has done here is an affront to justice. She has abused this system by bringing a false claim for amongst other things money, status, political reasons,” Tacopina said.
Carroll was awarded approximately $5 million in damages, including $3 million for the defamation charge and $2 million for the civil battery charge.
*  *  *
A New York City jury has found former President Trump liable for sexual assault, but not rape, in a New York defamation case brought by accuser E. Jean Carroll.
The jury awarded Carroll $20,000 in punitive damages for a battery claim, and around $5 million in compensatory damages for defamation by Trump. The verdict came after less than three hours of deliberation by jurors in US District Court in lower Manhattan. The jury did not find Trump liable for rape, as Carroll alleged.
Trump, who has long-denied her allegation dating back to the mid-90s, accused Carroll of using false claims as a way to promote her book. “I’ll say it with great respect: Number one, she’s not my type. Number two, it never happened,” the-then president told The Hill in an interview at the White House in June 2019.
U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan read instructions on the law to the nine-person jury before the panel began discussing Carroll’s allegations of battery and defamation shortly before noon.
If they believe Carroll, jurors can award compensatory and punitive damages. Trump, who did not attend the trial, has insisted he never sexually assaulted Carroll or even knew her.
Kaplan told jurors that the first question on the verdict form will be to decide whether they think there is more than a 50% chance that Trump raped Carroll inside a store dressing room. If they answer yes, they will then decide whether compensatory and punitive damages should be awarded.
If they answer no on the rape question, they can then decide if Trump subjected her to lesser forms of assault involving sexual contact without her consent or forcible touching to degrade her or gratify his sexual desire. If they answer yes on either of those questions, they will decide if damages are appropriate. -AP
The nine-member panel began discussing verdicts at 11:50 a.m. ET after Judge Lewis Kaplan gave his final instructions and a 10-question verdict form.
Carroll, 78, sued Trump in 2019, claiming the Republican sexually assaulted her in 1995 or 1996 in a dressing room at a Bergdorf Goodman department store in Manhattan. Because the alleged attack happened decades ago, Carroll was originally barred from suing over sexual battery, pushing her to sue for defamation over allegedly disparaging comments Trump made about the rape allegation.
Trump denied her allegation at the time and accused her of using false claims as a way to promote her book. “I’ll say it with great respect: Number one, she’s not my type. Number two, it never happened,” the-then president told The Hill in an interview at the White House in June 2019.
The D.C. Court of Appeals was then asked to weigh in on whether Trump was acting within the scope of his presidential duties when he denied raping Carroll and dismissed her during the interview.
Trump last October called her claims “a hoax” and “a lie.”",0
3,‘The View’ Argues Subway Passengers Should’ve Just Given Their Money to Serial Criminal Neely,https://www.infowars.com/posts/the-view-argues-subway-passengers-shouldve-just-given-their-money-to-serial-criminal-neely/,"The panel of ABC’s “The View” defended serial criminal Jordan Neely’s threats and extortion of New York City subway passengers preceding his untimely death, arguing the passengers should have just given him their money.
Co-host Sunny Hostin first demanded that Neely’s criminal history should not have been revealed to the public because that would be “re-victimizing this victim.”
“The reason he had so many mental health issues is because he saw the brutal murder of his mother at the age of 14. When he was recently arrested, rather than put him in jail, they actually — he pled guilty and he was sentenced to live at a Bronx treatment facility, take his medication, and stay clean for 15 months. Unfortunately, he left the place after 13 days,” Hostin said Tuesday.
“So this is a troubled person who needed help. As prosecutors, when someone is a danger to society, you don’t give them — you don’t put them in a mental health facility, you put them in prison,” she said, ignoring the fact Neely was a serial criminal who was repeatedly released back into the public thanks to Democrat soft-on-crime policies.
Hostin castigated the passengers for not surrendering their money to a homeless Neely right away when he was harassing passengers on the subway.
“This is what he was doing. He was shouting that he was hungry, that he was thirsty, and he had little to live for. Hungry, thirsty, and little to live for. Where was the humanity of anyone that was on that train?! I would have given him money! I would have tried to give him food! I would have tried to help! This is someone in need, in desperate need,” she said.
Hostin went on to excoriate Marine Daniel Penny, who put an aggressive Neely in a recovery position before he died on the F train.
“And I am ashamed that someone that was part of our armed forces decided to become a vigilante and kill him,” she whined, as if Penny preemptively decided to confront Neely that day.
Hostin then called for the defunding of the New York police — despite the fact they weren’t even involved in the killing of Neely.
“May I make a quick suggestion? New York City has the highest police budget in our entire country. I think it’s something like $5 billion. How about taking a billion dollars of that money, Whoopi, and doing what you did with Comic Relief, and get them the mental health services that they need?” she asked.
Penny’s lawyer released a statement Saturday explaining that his client never meant to harm Neely, but was compelled to subdue the mentally ill man when he “began aggressively threatening” passengers.
Neely was a homeless Michael Jackson impersonator, with 42 prior arrests from 2013 and 2021, who lost consciousness during the struggle with Penny and was later pronounced dead at a hospital. Penny was taken into custody and released without charges.
“We would first like to express, on behalf of Daniel Penny, our condolences to those close to Mr. Neely,” the law firm of Raiser and Kenniff, P.C. said in a statement Friday. “When Mr. Neely began aggressively threatening Daniel Penny and the other passengers, Daniel, with the help of others, acted to protect themselves, until help arrived.”
“Daniel never intended to harm Mr. Neely and could not have foreseen his untimely death,” the statement said. “We hope that out of this awful tragedy will come a new commitment by our elected officials to address the mental health crisis on our streets and subways.”
George Floyd-esque BLM demonstrations sprang up in NYC and other cities to protest Neely’s untimely death last week and characterize it as a hate crime.

4,"Kari Lake Torches Fox News: ‘Globalist Network Run by Globalists Who Want to Destroy Constitution, Second Amendment’",https://www.infowars.com/posts/kari-lake-torches-fox-news-globalist-network-run-by-globalists-who-want-to-destroy-constitution-second-amendment/,"Former Arizona GOP gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake bashed cable news network Fox News during an interview with Piers Morgan, who was attempting to corner her in a gun control debate.
During Monday’s episode of Piers Morgan Uncensored, which coincidentally is also available on streaming platform Fox Nation, the show host tried to get Lake to agree with the results of a poll conducted by Fox News which showed a majority of respondents favored gun restrictions.
Kari Lake Drops Nuclear Truth Bomb About Fox News: 'A Globalist Network Pushing a Globalist Agenda' pic.twitter.com/UNLoMIDSdb
“A Fox News poll found 87% of Americans back stricter background checks. 81% agree the legal age to buy a gun should be raised to 21. 80% agree that anyone who buys a gun should go through a mental health assessment. 80% want police to take guns from people considered a danger to themselves. 77% want a 30-day waiting off period for all gun purchases,” Morgan said.
“That doesn’t surprise me,” Lake replied, adding, “Fox News is a globalist network pushing a globalist agenda. And the globalists want to make sure…”
“Fox News is watched by a lot of gun owners,” Morgan interrupted.
“Fox News is a globalist network run by globalists who want to bring down our constitution and take away our Second Amendment,” Lake responded.
“I don’t think Fox News is a globalist network. It’s the biggest conservative network in the country,” Morgan argued.
“They fired Tucker Carlson,” Lake pointed out.
“Would you not agree with any of them?” Morgan asked.
Lake maintained the misguided poll respondents were requesting an unconstitutional action. “If you pass any of those and make those laws, they’re unconstitutional. We have a Constitution,” she told Morgan.
Elsewhere in the discussion, Morgan attempted to get the former Republican candidate to admit she lost her election in Arizona, which Lake pushed back against telling Morgan to look at her evidence of voter fraud on her Rumble channel.

5,They’re Coming To Take You Away,https://www.infowars.com/posts/theyre-coming-to-take-you-away/,"Suppose I tell you in advance that the essay you are reading is meant to startle you. And suppose I suggest, by way of demonstration, that two people as loosely connected as the leader of the “COVID Crisis Group” and Joe Biden’s “Special Envoy To Monitor and Combat Antisemitism” – both of whom have recently offered recommendations for improving political life in the United States – are in fact determined to unravel American freedoms.
Would you be surprised?
Well, if so, that is exactly the startling fact I am trying to bring to your attention. True, you may not have heard that the 34 COVID-19 “experts” headed by one Philip Zelikow (last seen justifying the concealment of information about the 9/11 attacks) and anti-Semitism “ambassador” Deborah Lipstadt – perhaps best known for slandering scads of Jewish survivors of the Nazis as “soft-core” Holocaust deniers because they objected to the massacre of 1,462 of Gaza’s civilians nine years ago – are both out to dismantle the Bill of Rights. But if you haven’t, it isn’t because they’ve been coy about their objectives.
Take the Zelikow panel. Its new book on “the lessons learned from COVID-19” openly conflates the federal government’s management of a respiratory virus with “wartime” – thus rationalizing the executive branch’s preemption of democratic government. Not only that, Zelikow and his band of “experts” explicitly call for the consolidation of power in the hands of an unelected “health security enterprise” that would control, among other things, a “systematic biomedical surveillance network.” And in case you can’t guess who is likely to benefit from the snooping, the panel goes on to praise the coercive experimental drug program that gave us the COVID-19 “vaccines” – “a bargain at $30 billion,” according to the editors of the Washington Post – signaling at one stroke the experts’ contempt for the Nuremberg Code and their subservience to Big Pharma.
As for Lipstadt, she has launched her attack on the First Amendment by redefining “anti-Semitism” so as to include an extraordinary range of political speech. Her first step in that transformation is the familiar trick of confusing criticism of the Israeli government with anti-Jewish bigotry. But her second step is newer and, arguably, even more disturbing: she tars all denigration of Jews with the hot-button label “conspiracy theory.”
Let’s be clear: however noble the pretext of opposing Jew-hatred, it should be obvious that once you characterize anti-Semitism as a “conspiracy theory” you have made a case for censorship. As Lipstadt herself explained to Jane Eisner of Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism (in an interview printed in the latest AARP Magazine but not available online): “[I]t’s a conspiracy theory that Jews control the media, the banks, the election process, etc. If you believe that there is a group controlling these things, then essentially you’re saying that you don’t believe in democracy.”
And there’s the trouble. After all, an overt attack on democracy isn’t a viewpoint; it isn’t even an expression of run-of-the-mill bigotry. It’s a threat to the state. And it follows, if you accept Lipstadt’s formulation, that anyone the government can label an “anti-Semite” may now be punished in the same way the Biden administration is already punishing people who protested the presidential election results of November 2020. Note, too, the selective parameters of the offense: blaming Donald Trump’s election on the Russians is presumably “legitimate” speech; but accusing a “group” of controlling “the election process” can land you in jail – that is, when the “group” is not an official enemy but a favored minority, and when that “process” has reached results endorsed by those in power.
So the Zelikow panel and Ambassador Lipstadt can’t be accused of hiding their illiberal goals. Like the Democratic lynch mob that denounced Matt Taibbi and Michael Shellenberger on the floor of Congress last March for revealing the extent of government censorship of Twitter, these propagandists quite openly assert that surveillance is good for us, while free speech is entirely too dangerous to be entrusted to mere citizens.
“Ordinary folks and national security agencies responsible for our security,” Congressman Colin Allred lectured Taibbi, “are trying their best to find a way to make sure that our online discourse doesn’t get people hurt, or see our democracy undermined.” It’s pretty breathtaking to watch an African-American liberal solemnly declare that the CIA and the FBI are the true guardians of democracy – not to mention his defense of the security state’s behind-the-scenes censorship of political speech. But what’s even more ominous is that not a single prominent Democratic politician nor a single pundit in mainstream liberal media has repudiated anything the congressman said.
Is it any wonder, then, that no one in mainstream media has mentioned the totalitarian tendencies implicit in the COVID Crisis Group’s recommendations for “pandemic” regulation via dismantling democracy, or in Ambassador Lipstadt’s appeals to the public to “discredit” anti-Semitism by recasting it as a criminal conspiracy?
Of course it isn’t. And that is my point. That is my motive in writing in tandem about these two apparently disparate subjects, connected only by the facts that both of them involve recent public declarations and that both of them represent attacks on fundamental liberties.
Because the truth is that condemning freedom is now so entirely respectable that it’s happening practically everywhere – under every possible pretext, almost any day, from just about any left-liberal institution that claims to care about the public good. Close your eyes, and you can hardly tell whether what you’re hearing is coming from a Democratic Party stalwart or from an old-line Soviet apologist explaining why Andrei Sakharov or Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn or Yuri Orlov is really, notwithstanding the accuracy of what he’s been saying, a threat to the state who deserves to be muzzled or jailed.
And the media’s silence about it all is as ominous as the Orwellian nattering of the freedom-haters themselves.
Take another look at the Zelikow panel’s assessment of the US government’s performance during the “COVID crisis.” Writing about what the “experts” praise or blame in their report, the Washington Post never once mentions the crippling of the US working-class economy due to arbitrary confinements and business shutdowns, the educational damage done to a whole generation of children through needless school closures, the reckless suspension of representative democracy in four-fifths of our states, the medically unjustifiable trauma caused by “mask mandates,” or the undermining of the national healthcare system through an obsessive focus on one respiratory virus while more serious issues were sidelined for over a year. As far as the Post is concerned, the real outrages of the COVID coup never happened at all.
Even when the experts and the editors do manage to notice something sinister, they go out of their way to miss the point. The Zelikow panel specifically notes the “four pandemic planning exercises” staged by the US government barely a year before the announcement of the COVID-19 outbreak. And it offers a few technical criticisms of the proceedings. 
But neither the panel nor the Post editors’ congratulatory summary of its conclusions addresses the fact that the exercises – which omitted any suggestion for using repurposed drugs as early treatment for a novel virus, as in all previous influenza-like outbreaks – made a point of discussing the importance of thought-policing social media. That prescription for censorship became a grim reality after March 2020. But you’d never know it from reading the Zelikow panel’s assessment of the government’s mistakes in addressing the “pandemic.”
And Lipstadt? She claims to be a passionate defender of free speech. But that didn’t stop her from smearing Senator Ron Johnson as a “white nationalist sympathizer” because of his politically incorrect comments about Black Lives Matter. And when that issue made it to the op-ed page of the New York Times, it was only to further demonize Johnson; Lipstadt’s slander got a pass. 
Why do I worry so much about this? Well, first of all because an attack on freedom is an attack on all of us.
But I think there is a special reason for alarm. It’s not just that our ruling elites believe that we, the people, need to be stripped of our right to free expression. I’m afraid that the freedom-haters clustered around our figurehead President are not even aware just how thin the ice is onto which they’re propelling us. Their position (taking the most charitable possible view of it) runs something like this: if the public isn’t exposed to views of which the censors disapprove, hoi polloi will meekly accept whatever policies are imposed on them (for their own good, of course).
But the censors are wrong. The fabric of American political life has been strained to such tautness that a single acute crisis might rupture it altogether. And if that happens, people who have been deprived of reasonable dissent will not shrink from violent opposition; on the contrary, they will embrace it. When the monolithic narrative that is all they have been taught lies in ruins, they will replace it not with a rational, informed alternative – for they will know of none – but with whatever satisfies the rage of a population that realizes, too late, that it has been hoodwinked.
Woe to the freedom-haters when the lion they think they have tamed turns its fury on the liberal society that soothsayers like Zelikow and Lipstadt still imagine they are defending!

6,All Hell Breaks Loose In Nuclear-Armed Pakistan After Imran Khan’s Arrest,https://www.infowars.com/posts/all-hell-breaks-loose-in-nuclear-armed-pakistan-after-imran-khans-arrest/,"All hell is breaking loose in Pakistan, amid fears there could be a slide into widescale civil unrest or even full-blown civil war, after on Tuesday the former Prime Minister Imran Khan was arrested and taken into police custody while he was entering the Islamabad High Court for a hearing in a case.
The 70-year-old cricketer-turned-politician has been pursued in court filings by Pakistan’s anti-corruption agency, but the dramatic move to actually detain Khan is a huge and unprecedented escalation, threatening to unleash mayhem in the streets of the nuclear-armed country.
⚡️Imran Khan has been arrested pic.twitter.com/niUnzIzDKF
His party, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), immediately called for mass protests, which quickly exploded across multiple cities and in front police and military locations, including in the capital Islamabad, but also in Lahore, Karachi, Gujranwala, Rawalpindi, Faisalabad, Multan, Peshawar, and Mardan – according to international reports.
Viral images and video of Khan being escorted by security forces in riot control gear and whisked away in an armored van are fueling anger in the streets. A government statement has said the arrest was “for the crime of corruption”.
According to Al Jazeera, “Khan has been slapped with more than 100 cases – including corruption, ‘terrorism’ and even blasphemy – since he was removed from power last April through a parliamentary vote of no confidence.”

Heightening the risk of national instability is the fact that many of Khan’s well-placed enemies are top military and intelligence officials:
Khan’s detention came after Pakistan’s military spokesman, Maj. Gen. Ahmed Sharif, released an usually sharply worded statement against the former prime minister, warning him not to malign a serving officer. That followed recent allegations made by Khan that a military intelligence official was leading behind a plot to kill him.
Sharif described Khan’s claims as “highly irresponsible and baseless allegations” which were “unfortunate, deplorable and unacceptable.”
To add insult to the allegations, Khan referred to the military intelligence official as “Dirty Harry,” from an old Clint Eastwood movie — allegations he doubled down on Tuesday before reaching the courthouse.
A Pakistani political analyst has explained to Al Jazeera that “Ever since this whole process started with ousting of the former prime minister 13 months ago, it has become crystal clear that the ruling political elite as well as the establishment in the country did not want Imran khan back in any capacity, in any ruling capacity.”

Corps Commander home in Lahore attacked and broken to pieces. Several memorials… pic.twitter.com/mNBUSnLXOk
This suggests significant civil unrest to come: “They will go to whatever lengths to ensure this happens,” the analyst, Zeeshan Salahuddin, said.
One pro-Khan, opposition social media user had this to say: “This is unprecedented in Pakistani history. Pakistani people are taking the protests to the Army — the real rulers of the country — finally.”
Already there are reports of casualties from the protests coming out of Pakistan on Tuesday, also with reports and footage showing that demonstrators have stormed a Pakistani Army headquarters.
Footage shows people approaching a high-secure entry area of the Pakistan Army HQ in Rawalpindi, in an unprecedented and highly volatile situation…

There are also widespread reports circulating on social media that in some locales police and military might be using live fire to put quell the unrest.
The pro-Khan crowds could target government buildings and ministries next. Al Jazeera is reporting that “In Lahore, protesters gathered outside the former prime minister’s Zaman Park residence and blocked the adjacent roads by burning tires.”

Travis conducted the “experiment” over the weekend at a concert in Franklin, Tennessee, by leaving a cooler full of free beer out with an offer to “pick which beer you want.”

The ice chest contained beers from Bud Light, Yeungling, and Michelob Ultra and was left out for about four hours before he came back to review the results.
“I’m not a marketing expert, but the only beer left at the WestFest VIP event — Bud Light,” Travis said, adding, “Not ideal, not good.”
“No one would take the Bud Light all night long,” Travis explained. “Big issue going forward for Bud Light is many don’t even want to be seen with product. They just pick another brand.”
Travis concluded people’s refusal to consume the beer in public spells even more disaster for the embattled brand.
Overall consumption of Bud Light is now down 26%. That’s an unmitigated disaster for the brand. And many are now avoiding the beer to avoid being mocked for drinking the beer. There’s no quick fix here, brand is slaughtered in red state beer drinking communities. Bet there is…
“Overall consumption of Bud Light is now down 26%. That’s an unmitigated disaster for the brand,” Travis noted on Twitter. “And many are now avoiding the beer to avoid being mocked for drinking the beer. There’s no quick fix here, brand is slaughtered in red state beer drinking communities. Bet there is hardly any at SEC tailgates this fall.”
As Bud Light hemorrhages support, AB InBev CEO Michel Doukeris has blamed “misinformation and confusion” on social media for the woke backlash and nationwide boycott.
“People often talk about this topic in social media like noise… You have one fact and every person puts an opinion behind the fact,” Doukeris told the Financial Times Tuesday. “And then the opinions start to be replicated fast on each and every comment. By the time that 10 or 20 people put a comment out there, the reality is no longer what the fact is, but is more [about] what the comments were.”
Meanwhile, retailers like Costco are having a hard time moving the beer off its shelves despite selling clearance 36-packs of Bud Light for $14.97 —  a cost of 41 cents per beer!
Time will tell if Bud Light can recover from its egregious decision to alienate its core customer base.",0

Day 2 of CEIR’s Summit on American Democracy (May 9, 2023)
Independent journalist Laura Loomer noted CEIR is linked to billionaire leftist George Soros and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.
…founded by Becker, a hard core Leftist activist, CEIR is documented as being a SOROS tied advocacy group that provides grants and conducts research to increase Democrat voter turnout in swing states. Becker created CEIR in 2016 in response to President Trump’s election, which Becker claims was the result of “foreign interference”. However, Becker and CEIR clearly have no issue with election interference, because in August 2020, less than three months before the Presidential election, CEIR accepted $69.5 million from Facebook founder and billionaire Mark Zuckerberg and his Chinese wife, Priscilla Chan to create more mail in ballot drop boxes in key swing states under the guise of “COVID-19 safety precautions”.",0
12,New York Suburbs Panic After NYC Mayor Plans Migrant Relocation,https://www.infowars.com/posts/new-york-suburbs-panic-after-nyc-mayor-plans-migrant-relocation/,"Rich New York suburbanites are in a huff over a plan by NYC Mayor Eric Adams to relocate migrants to hotels in their towns.
The NIMBY New Yorkers reacted with shock and dismay at Adams’ Friday statement that he plans to pay to house around 300 migrant men in two hotels in Rockland and Orange Counties, after the illegal immigrants were bused up from Texas and other places.
On Saturday, Rockland officials began a campaign to stop Adams’ plan, according to the NY Times.
“It felt like they were trying to do a Friday night drop,” said Orangetown town supervisor Teresa Kenney, whose town is in Rockland County. She says she learned about the plan just hours before Adams announced it.
“I feel like the mayor called me to check a box so he couldn’t be criticized for not talking to us.”
A state of emergency was issued in Rockland Country on Saturday by executive Ed Day, a Republican, who said that municipalities could not transport or house migrants in his county without permission.
“Whatever we need to do to stop this, we will do,” he said on Sunday, adding that the county is prepared to issue fines up to $2,000 per violation per day to any hotel that takes in migrants through NYC’s program.
“They’re basically dumping them into a county where we’re not prepared for them,” he said.
New York State Association of Counties Executive Director Stephen Acquario said: “This is a homelessness problem, and it’s largely the fault of the federal government,” adding “And here we have the lowest unit of government cleaning up the mess of the United States.”

13,California Reparations Task Force Approves Payments for Black Residents,https://www.infowars.com/posts/california-reparations-task-force-approves-payments-for-black-residents/,"The nine-member California Reparations Task Force has approved a packet of recommendations that, if agreed upon the California legislature and signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, would provide Black residents with financial redress for the historical impact of slavery and discrimination, US media reported.
The task force gave final approval at a meeting in Oakland over the weekend to a significant list of proposals seeking to rectify racial inequalities across California that could cost $800 billion, US media reported.
The task force said reparations are not only morally justifiable but have the potential to address long standing racial disparities and inequalities, the report said.
The panel’s vote approved a detailed account of historical discrimination against Black Californians in areas such as housing, education, policing and incarceration, among others, the report said.
The task force recommended that the state create an agency that could provide services to descendants of enslaved people to calculate what the state owes them, the report added.
While the panel did not specify what form the compensation would take, it stated that the reparations should include cash or its equivalent, the report added.
Almost 7 percent of California residents, or about 2.5 million people, are Black.

14,DeSantis Prohibits Chinese From Buying Land in Florida,https://www.infowars.com/posts/desantis-prohibits-chinese-from-buying-land-in-florida/,"Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed legislation effectively banning Chinese citizens from purchasing land in Florida today, with an exception being made only for US citizens of Chinese descent or permanent residents of the United States.
Speaking at a press conference in Brooksville, the governor insisted that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is not wanted in his state.”We want to maintain this as the free state of Florida,” he said as quoted by one US media outlet.
DeSantis further alleged that the CCP is engaged in a “concerted effort to acquire farmland throughout the United States,” and argued that China should not be allowed to be “in charge of any food production,” equating food security with national security.
Relations between Washington and Beijing took a turn for the worse during the presidency of Donald Trump when the then-POTUS engaged in a veritable tariff war with China.
Things only turned worse under the Biden administration when the US moved to create a new military bloc AUKUS to oppose China’s interests in Southeast Asia and ramped up efforts to funnel weapons to Taiwan.

15,Top Republicans Believe Trump Nomination is Now “Inevitable”,https://www.infowars.com/posts/top-republicans-believe-trump-nomination-is-now-inevitable/,"Top Republicans now believe that Donald Trump capturing the party’s nomination for the 2024 presidential election is “inevitable,” according to a new report.
After Trump garnered the endorsement of Sen. Steve Daines, the National Republican Senatorial Committee Chair, the Hill reports that Republican legislators are operating on the assumption that his nomination is all but a done deal.
One Republican Senator confirmed that he felt it was a foregone conclusion that Trump would be on the ticket.
“I just think that his nomination is inevitable. I really do. He’s going to be the nominee,” he said, adding, “I’d be stunned if he’s not.”
“You’ve seen the numbers. I’ve talked to voters. People are beginning to recognize that,” said the Senator, adding, “Steve Daines’s endorsement reflects that reality. He’s going to be the nominee, we want him to work with us.”
“Republican senators and GOP strategists say @SteveDaines endorsement is a sign that Trump is viewed as the favorite to win the party’s presidential nomination in 2024.”
Senator Daines endorsed Trump live on @DonaldJTrumpJr’s show last month.

Sen. Lindsey Graham said Trump was uniting the party and that his politically-motivated prosecution in New York had only served to rally support behind the 45th president.
“He’s certainly growing, if you believe in polling, and you hear it on the ground too. Part of it was a reaction to the New York prosecution. He became a victim of an out-of-control left-wing prosecutor and it gave him a bump,” said Graham.
The Senator said a lot of what happens depends on how Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis runs his campaign, although his poll numbers against Trump have been slipping in recent weeks.
As we highlighted yesterday, a new Washington Post/ABC News poll shows that Donald Trump has opened up a 7 point lead over Joe Biden, whose approval rating has sunk to a new record low.
Registered Democrats are still split 47%-47% on whether the party should nominate Biden or someone other than Biden in 2024, while 77 per cent of independents who lean Democratic want to see the 80-year-old replaced by a different candidate.

Doug Burgum (R) on Monday signed a bill into law that requires public school teachers to inform a student’s parents if they identify as transgender.
House Bill 1522 also prohibits K-12 students from using restrooms that correspond with the gender they identify as, and it bans schools from adopting policies that require or prohibit “any individual from using a student’s preferred gender pronoun.”
The legislation went into effect on Monday with Burgum’s signature.
Burgum previously vetoed a similar bill in March but said the version he signed into law on Monday excludes the “concerning language” that spurred his veto.
Burgum said:

House Bill 1522 largely codifies existing practices while reaffirming the First Amendment right to free speech, requiring restroom accommodations, balancing the rights and interests of students, parents and teachers, and not including the concerning language from the previously vetoed and sustained SB 2231.

After showing footage of hundreds of migrants lining up along the southern border wall awaiting processing, the man called for federal assistance and warned viewers not to trust the legacy media narrative.
“There’s hundreds of migrants crossing daily. Thousands of migrants downtown. Our city is being overrun,” he said. “We have a serious invasion here and we need help. We need the federal government to step in and stop this. We need these guys to go back to their country and not to wait here.”

“That’s what’s happening here; keep him silent, on the sidelines for as long as possible, unable to use his voice on any of these things. On Fox, on politics, on anything,” she said.
The video goes on to highlight Tucker discussing topics normally anathema to the corporate news such as the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, the truth behind the Ukraine war, the origins of COVID-19, transgender insanity, and so much more.
In the days since firing Tucker, Fox News lost HALF of its primetime audience.

20,"Galactic bubbles are more complex than imagined, researchers say",https://www.infowars.com/posts/galactic-bubbles-are-more-complex-than-imagined-researchers-say/,"Astronomers have revealed new evidence about the properties of the giant bubbles of high-energy gas that extend far above and below the Milky Way galaxy’s center.
In a study recently published in Nature Astronomy, a team led by scientists at The Ohio State University was able to show that the shells of these structures—dubbed “eRosita bubbles” after being found by the eRosita X-ray telescope—are more complex than previously thought.
Although they bear a striking similarity in shape to Fermi bubbles, eRosita bubbles are larger and more energetic than their counterparts. Known together as the “galactic bubbles” due to their size and location, they provide an exciting opportunity to study star formation history as well as reveal new clues about how the Milky Way came to be, said Anjali Gupta, lead author of the study and a former postdoctoral researcher at Ohio State who is now a professor of astronomy at Columbus State Community College.
These bubbles exist in the gas that surrounds galaxies, an area which is called the circumgalactic medium.
“Our goal was really to learn more about the circumgalactic medium, a place very important in understanding how our galaxy formed and evolved,” Gupta said. “A lot of the regions that we were studying happened to be in the region of the bubbles, so we wanted to see how different the bubbles are when compared to the regions which are away from the bubble.”
Previous studies had assumed that these bubbles were heated by the shock of gas as it blows outward from the galaxy, but this paper’s main findings suggest the temperature of the gas within the bubbles isn’t significantly different from the area outside of it.
“We were surprised to find that the temperature of the bubble region and out of the bubble region were the same,” said Gupta. Additionally, the study demonstrates that these bubbles are so bright because they’re filled with extremely dense gas, not because they are at hotter temperatures than the surrounding environment.
Gupta and Smita Mathur, co-author of the study and a professor of astronomy at Ohio State, did their analysis using observations made by the Suzaku satellite, a collaborative mission between NASA and the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency.
By analyzing 230 archival observations made between 2005 and 2014, researchers were able to characterize the diffuse emission—the electromagnetic radiation from very low density gas—of the galactic bubbles, as well as the other hot gases that surround them.
Although the origin of these bubbles has been debated in scientific literature, this study is the first that begins to settle it, said Mathur. As the team found an abundance of non-solar neon-oxygen and magnesium-oxygen ratios in the shells, their results strongly suggest that galactic bubbles were originally formed by nuclear star-forming activity, or the injection of energy by massive stars and other kinds of astrophysical phenomena, rather than through the activities of a supermassive black hole.
“Our data supports the theory that these bubbles are most likely formed due to intense star formation activity at the galactic center, as opposed to black hole activity occurring at the galactic center,” Mathur said. To further investigate the implications their discovery may have for other aspects of astronomy, the team hopes to use new data from other upcoming space missions to continue characterizing the properties of these bubbles, as well as work on novel ways to analyze the data they already have.
“Scientists really do need to understand the formation of the bubble structure, so by using different techniques to better our models, we’ll be able to better constrain the temperature and the emission measures that we are looking for,” said Gupta.
Other co-authors were Joshua Kingsbury and Sanskriti Das of Ohio State and Yair Krongold of the National Autonomous University of Mexico.",0
21,Biden Fact Checked Into Oblivion By Twitter Community Notes After Touting ‘Record’ Job Creation,https://www.infowars.com/posts/biden-fact-checked-into-oblivion-by-twitter-community-notes-after-touting-record-job-creation/,"Joe Biden was once again ruthlessly fact checked by Twitter’s Community Notes after he posted a chart claiming that he has created more jobs than any of the other previous Presidents in recent memory, a blatant attempt to mislead Americans.
“This is what happens when you invest in America,” Biden tweeted, adding“We have more work to do – but this is real progress.”
The chart he posted along with those comments shows Biden having created close to 500,000 jobs on average per month since he took office.
It shows other Presidents job creation stats, going back to Reagan, all way lower than Biden’s.
Community Notes soon took over the post, however, with readers pointing out that Biden has not created significantly more jobs than the other Presidents, and the chart merely shows the recovery of jobs after the COVID pandemic and lockdowns, which happened under Trump.
This is what happens when you invest in America.We have more work to do – but this is real progress. pic.twitter.com/Pur91mu3Pf
Biden and his handlers are acutely aware of these facts, but purposefully attempted to mislead Americans.
I'll Community Note this for youVery misleading: In March of 2020 the US was locked down due to COVID. Unemployment skyrocketed & many lost their jobs.When Biden came into office, lockdowns were ending & everyone got their jobs back.Biden calls this 'job creation'
I'll add some context:These jobs weren't created, these are people going back to workThe per month is skewed because it's over a different time scale, it will likely not stay this high after the full 4 yearsLastly, this is largely driven by covid, not investing in America
I'm just going to sit back and wait to see how the community notes destroy this manipulative post.
The Community Notes feature works by allowing all Twitter users to collaboratively add ‘context’ to posts. “If enough contributors from different points of view rate that note as helpful, the note will be publicly shown on a Tweet,” the platform states.
The system significantly reduces the risk of any partisan sources influencing the fact checks, as is apparent on other platforms such as Facebook where clearly non-independent actors are influencing content.
As we highlighted last week, Elon Musk touted the system, declaring that “Ending censorship in guise of virtue, handing control of the narrative to the people and actually accurate fact-checking are essential goals.”
“Naturally, those who used to control the narrative and censored views they disliked are less than thrilled,” Musk further asserted, adding “How tragic.”
Now, practically every time Biden tweets, the false claims are exposed:

22,God Help Us: Kamala Harris to Run AI Taskforce,https://www.infowars.com/posts/god-help-us-kamala-harris-to-run-ai-taskforce/,"US Vice President Kamala Harris has been appointed to head a new artificial intelligence initiative in partnership with leading companies in the field, the White House announced in a press release on Thursday.
Harris and other senior officials in the administration of President Joe Biden will meet with the CEOs of Alphabet, Anthropic, Microsoft, and OpenAI to remind them of their “responsibility to make sure their products are safe before they are deployed or made public.”   
The meeting is intended to keep the companies on track toward “driving responsible, trustworthy and ethical innovation with safeguards that mitigate risks and potential harms to individuals and our society,” according to the White House, which referenced recent executive orders and official statements reminding tech companies that their products were subject to civil rights law and other protections against unlawful discrimination.  
The four companies, along with Hugging Face, NVIDIA, and Stability AI, will also submit to a public evaluation of their capabilities by thousands of industry experts and other curious members of the public at DEFCON 31, the Las Vegas hacking convention that has repeatedly put the insecurity of the US’ voting machines on display by giving children a chance to hack them.
The White House also announced the creation of seven new National AI Research Institutes focusing on climate, agriculture, energy, public health, education, and cybersecurity, explaining the new institutes would “support the development of a diverse AI workforce” with $140 million in funding from the National Science Foundation. 
The administration is also giving the public the chance to weigh in on government AI policy starting this summer, according to the press release.  
Tasked with stemming the flow of migrants over the US’ southern border upon taking office in 2021, Harris instead presided over a record amount of illegal immigration, earning her the lowest approval rating of any modern US vice president. Last year, she was assigned with developing a blueprint for fighting “disinformation,” harassment and abuse online despite having no experience in the technology sector.  
While hundreds of experts in the AI field have called for a moratorium on, or at least a dramatic slowdown of, AI development until internationally agreed-upon safety measures can be put in place, the US has thus far shied away from issuing any strong statements about the technology. Last month, Biden met with his Council of Advisors on Science and Technology to discuss the “risks and opportunities” in the field but declined to address the experts’ warnings while admitting AI “could be” dangerous.",0

The research, published this week in scientific journal Nature, explained that of the 7 million people selected for the study, 745,041 vaccinated and 3.8 million unvaccinated subjects were left to compare after controlling for confounding variables like medications and contraceptives.
The results were startling.
“We demonstrated a higher risk and incidence rate of retinal vascular occlusion following COVID-19 vaccination, after adjusting for potential confounding factors,” the researchers wrote. “The risk of retinal vascular occlusion, except for CRAO, has been promptly observed in individuals receiving vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. The risk factors for retinal vascular occlusion include diabetes, hypertension, obesity, coronary artery disease, and stroke.”
In summary, the results found that “two years after vaccination, the chances of all subtypes… of retinal vascular occlusion increased significantly in the vaccinated cohort.”
“The overall risk of retinal vascular occlusion in the vaccinated cohort was 2.19 times higher than that in the unvaccinated cohort at 2 years,” the Nature paper concluded, adding “no disparity was detected between brand and dose of vaccines.”
Despite the clear correlation, the study claimed that “[a]dditional research is required to draw a solid conclusion regarding the association between retinal vascular occlusion and COVID-19 vaccines.”

25,Study of Uranus’ large moons shows four may hold water,https://www.infowars.com/posts/study-of-uranus-large-moons-shows-four-may-hold-water/,"Re-analysis of data from NASA’s Voyager spacecraft, along with new computer modeling, has led NASA scientists to conclude that four of Uranus’ largest moons likely contain an ocean layer between their cores and icy crusts. 
Their study is the first to detail the evolution of the interior makeup and structure of all five large moons: Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, Oberon, and Miranda. The work suggests four of the moons hold oceans that could be dozens of miles deep.
In all, at least 27 moons circle Uranus, with the four largest ranging from Ariel, at 720 miles (1,160 kilometers) across, to Titania, which is 980 miles (1,580 kilometers) across. Scientists have long thought that Titania, given its size, would be most likely to retain internal heat, caused by radioactive decay. The other moons had previously been widely considered too small to retain the heat necessary to keep an internal ocean from freezing, especially because heating created by the gravitational pull of Uranus is only a minor source of heat.
The National Academies’ 2023 Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey prioritized exploring Uranus. In preparation for such a mission, planetary scientists are focusing on the ice giant to bolster their knowledge about the mysterious Uranus system. Published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets, the new work could inform how a future mission might investigate the moons, but the paper also has implications that go beyond Uranus, said lead author Julie Castillo-Rogez of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California.
“When it comes to small bodies—dwarf planets and moons—planetary scientists previously have found evidence of oceans in several unlikely places, including the dwarf planets Ceres and Pluto, and Saturn’s moon Mimas,” she said. “So there are mechanisms at play that we don’t fully understand. This paper investigates what those could be and how they are relevant to the many bodies in the solar system that could be rich in water but have limited internal heat.”
The study revisited findings from NASA’s Voyager 2 flybys of Uranus in the 1980s and from ground-based observations. The authors built computer models infused with additional findings from NASA’s Galileo, Cassini, Dawn, and New Horizons (each of which discovered ocean worlds), including insights into the chemistry and the geology of Saturn’s moon Enceladus, Pluto and its moon Charon, and Ceres—all icy bodies around the same size as the Uranian moons.
The researchers used that modeling to gauge how porous the Uranian moons’ surfaces are, finding that they’re likely insulated enough to retain the internal heat that would be needed to host an ocean. In addition, they found what could be a potential heat source in the moons’ rocky mantles, which release hot liquid, and would help an ocean maintain a warm environment—a scenario that is especially likely for Titania and Oberon, where the oceans may even be warm enough to potentially support habitability.
By investigating the composition of the oceans, scientists can learn about materials that might be found on the moons’ icy surfaces as well, depending on whether substances underneath were pushed up from below by geological activity. There is evidence from telescopes that at least one of the moons, Ariel, has material that flowed onto its surface, perhaps from icy volcanoes, relatively recently.
In fact, Miranda, the innermost and fifth largest moon, also hosts surface features that appear to be of recent origin, suggesting it may have held enough heat to maintain an ocean at some point. The recent thermal modeling found that Miranda is unlikely to have hosted water for long: It loses heat too quickly and is probably frozen now.
But internal heat wouldn’t be the only factor contributing to a moon’s subsurface ocean. A key finding in the study suggests that chlorides, as well as ammonia, are likely abundant in the oceans of the icy giant’s largest moons. Ammonia has been long known to act as antifreeze. In addition, the modeling suggests that salts likely present in the water would be another source of antifreeze, maintaining the bodies’ internal oceans.
Of course, there still are a lot of questions about the large moons of Uranus, Castillo-Rogez said, adding that there is plenty more work to be done: “We need to develop new models for different assumptions on the origin of the moons in order to guide planning for future observations.”
Digging into what lies beneath and on the surfaces of these moons will help scientists and engineers choose the best science instruments to survey them. For instance, determining that ammonia and chlorides may be present means that spectrometers, which detect compounds by their reflected light, would need to use a wavelength range that covers both kinds of compounds.
Likewise, they can use that knowledge to design instruments that can probe the deep interior for liquid. Searching for electrical currents that contribute to a moon’s magnetic field is generally the best way to find a deep ocean, as Galileo mission scientists did at Jupiter’s moon Europa. However, the cold water in the interior oceans of moons such as Ariel and Umbriel could make the oceans less able to carry these electrical currents and would present a new kind of challenge for scientists working to figure out what lies beneath.",0
26,Soros & Fortress To Acquire Vice Media Out Of Bankruptcy,https://www.infowars.com/posts/soros-fortress-to-acquire-vice-media-out-of-bankruptcy/,"Vice Media, which once had a valuation of $5.7 billion, went woke and is now broke, is set to be acquired out of bankruptcy at a valuation of around $400 million by Fortress Investment Group and Soros Fund Management, according to The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter.
A bankruptcy filing appears imminent and would be a fitting ending to the tumultuous story of Vice, a new-media Phoenix that rose out of the ashes with its iconoclastic, counterculture facade, then quickly sought to supplant the media establishment before persuading it to invest hundreds of millions. In 2017, after a funding round from the private-equity firm TPG Group, Vice was worth $5.7 billion. Around this time, the company realized that for the money to keep flowing, it would need to curb its rebellious ways and quickly turned woke, losing most of its fans in the process…. just in case anyone wonders why Vice went woke. 
As a result, the company’s current valuation is only a fraction of what it was five years ago, as we mentioned earlier this week when discussing the imminent bankruptcy filing.
WSJ said under the deal to purchase the distressed media company out of bankruptcy, all stockholders, including TPG, Sixth Street Partners, and media tycoon James Murdoch would be wiped out in the proposed reorganization plan. The people said outstanding debts held by TPG and Sixth Street “would also be impaired as part of the plan.”
The company’s largest debtholder, hedge fund Fortress, will likely end up controlling the company. The hedge fund would probably take control of management. They said Fortress would find another role within the company for Vice co-founder Shane Smith. 
Another buyer could emerge and outbid Vice’s lenders for control in a court-supervised sale in Chapter 11 that is expected to begin next week. 
How it started, how it’s going…

27,Will a New BRICS Currency Change Anything? Maybe,https://www.infowars.com/posts/will-a-new-brics-currency-change-anything-maybe/,"Money first originated through the voluntary exchange of commodities, such as gold and silver, in order to eliminate the inefficiencies of barter.
As Austrian school of economics founder Carl Menger explained:
Money is not an invention of the state. It is not the product of a legislative act. Even the sanction of political authority is not necessary for its existence. Certain commodities came to be money quite naturally, as the result of economic relationships that were independent of the power of the state.
However, governments quickly learned that they could gain enormous wealth and power by taking control of money. Ludwig von Mises detailed in his magnum opus Human Action how this control has harmed human progress and noted that “For two hundred years the governments have interfered with the market’s choice of the money medium. Even the most bigoted étatists [statists] do not venture to assert that this interference has proved beneficial.”
Murray N. Rothbard further elaborated in What Has Government Done to Our Money? that
government meddling with money has not only brought untold tyranny into the world; it has also brought chaos and not order. It has fragmented the peaceful, productive world market and shattered it into a thousand pieces, with trade and investment hobbled and hampered by myriad restrictions, controls, artificial rates, currency breakdowns, etc. It has helped bring about wars by transforming a world of peaceful intercourse into a jungle of warring currency blocs. In short, we find that coercion, in money as in other matters, brings, not order, but conflict and chaos.
We see this chaos every day, with the economy bouncing from inflation to deflation and boom to bust. How did we reach this point and could it change going forward?
Prior to World War II, the British pound was the world’s “reserve currency.” However, after the war, the United States had the strongest economy and largest amount of gold reserves in the world.
At the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944, the US dollar was tied to gold at thirty-five dollars per ounce, and all other currencies were tied to the US dollar at fixed exchange rates. That made the dollar the “world reserve currency,” which means it was the only currency accepted throughout the world for the settlement of international trade accounts.
In the 1960s and early 1970s, the US government’s out-of-control spending spurred a run on US gold reserves by foreign governments. In response, President Richard Nixon ended all ties between the US dollar and gold in 1971. Since then, there has been no commodity backing for any currencies in the world. This led to higher inflation and lower living standards than would have otherwise occurred.
Following the Arab oil embargo of 1973, the US government agreed to provide military support to Saudi Arabia in exchange for Saudi Arabia agreeing to sell oil only in US dollars. This “petrodollar” arrangement helped solidify the dollar as the world’s reserve currency for the past fifty years.
What can compete with the US dollar now?
“BRICS” is an acronym for five of the largest emerging countries: Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. The BRICS countries comprise about 42 percent of the global population and 32 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP). By contrast, the US has only 4 percent of the global population and 16 percent of global GDP.
In addition, several countries are rumored to be joining the BRICS alliance in the future, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Turkey, Thailand, and Indonesia.
The BRICS countries have grown weary of being beholden to the US dollar and US monetary policy. This is particularly true in recent years, with (a) the 40 percent increase in the US money supply that has led to the highest inflation in forty years; (b) the increase of the US federal government debt to GDP to 120 percent, double the level of fifteen years ago and triple the level of forty years ago (as shown below), plus over $200 trillion in unfunded liabilities for Social Security, Medicare, and other obligations; and (c) the aggressive US foreign policy, including sanctions relating to the Russia-Ukraine war.
Figure 1: Total public debt as percent of gross domestic product
Due to the Russia-Ukraine war and China’s continued economic growth, the BRICS are accelerating plans to take power from the US.
So far, the BRICS have started initiatives such as the New Development Bank for infrastructure lending, a Contingent Reserve Arrangement to protect against foreign exchange pressures, and a BRICS payment system as an alternative to the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT).
They are also working on a BRICS reserve asset based on a basket of the BRICS countries’ currencies to compete with the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) special drawing rights (SDR). The SDR is based on a basket of the US dollar, the euro, the British pound, the Japanese yen, and the Chinese yuan. The SDR is not officially a currency, but it can be created out of thin air and sold for national currencies if the IMF tells countries to buy SDRs.
Central banks around the world are already starting to diversify away from the US dollar and into the Chinese yuan and other currencies.
After Russia invaded Ukraine, the US banned Russia from the dollar system. However, Russia is the largest oil provider to China, so Russia and China started trading in Chinese yuan rather than US dollars.
India has also paid for most of their Russian oil in currencies other than the US dollar lately. Recently, Brazil and China agreed to conduct all future trade in their own currencies. French oil company TotalEnergies recently completed its first purchase of liquefied natural gas from China using the Chinese yuan.
As a result of these and other efforts, the percentage of global currency reserves in US dollars has fallen from 73 percent in 2001 to 58 percent now.
The BRICS countries are unlikely to seriously challenge the king dollar if their only tool is just another fiat currency they can create out of thin air.
The US has the largest and safest government bond market, no capital controls, and a reputation for enforcing the rule of law. By contrast, the BRICS countries are hardly known for respecting laws or having strong currencies.
Perhaps more importantly, non-US entities have $12 trillion of US dollar-denominated debt that they need to pay back with dollars, so abandoning the dollar would be incredibly difficult and costly.
Of course, their competition with the dollar would ultimately end in failure, as Bretton Woods did, if the BRICS countries continue to create money out of thin air to finance their warfare and welfare spending. The BRICS will have a much better chance if they create a hard currency backed by gold or other commodities like oil.
The BRICS countries have a combined gold reserves of 5,352 tons, which makes them the second largest owner of gold reserves after the US, which has 8,133 tons. China has quadrupled its gold reserves over the past twenty years, as shown below.
Figure 2: China gold reserves
BRICS countries are wisely exploring gold-backed currencies. For example, in March 2022, Russia announced they were linking the ruble to gold at five thousand rubles per gram and requiring payment for their exports in rubles. It was also recently reported that Russia and Iran are working on a new “stablecoin” cryptocurrency backed by gold to compete with the dollar.
How ironic if the “free market” US were outcompeted by an even more free-market currency created by the likes of Russia, China, and Iran.
If the BRICS are successful and the US does not change its policies to focus on a stronger dollar, less spending, and peace instead of war, it is possible the dollar will slowly lose its “reserve currency” status. This would hurt US living standards and lead to less power for the US government, similar to the weakening of the UK after World War II. All empires in history have failed, and the US will not likely be an exception—if the BRICS can create a successful hard currency to compete with the dollar.
Unless the BRICS are willing to give up the power to create money out of thin air and create a currency that is backed 100 percent by gold or other commodities, any new currency will likely suffer the same problems as the dollar and other fiat currencies.
Ultimately, until money is returned to the free market so it cannot be manipulated by governments, we will continue to experience the economic problems that have plagued mankind since governments started meddling with our money.",0
28,Google Computer Scientist Quits So He Can Warn World Of ‘Scary’ And ‘Dangerous’ AI,https://www.infowars.com/posts/google-computer-scientist-quits-so-he-can-warn-world-of-scary-and-dangerous-ai/,"A Google computer scientist dubbed the ‘Godfather’ of AI has quit the company, stating that he did so in order to warn the world of the dangers that the technology presents as big-tech engages in an AI arms race.
Geoffrey Hinton responded Monday to a New York Times article that insinuated he had quit Google in order to criticise the company, noting that the real reason was he actually wanted to freely talk about the dangers of AI.
In the NYT today, Cade Metz implies that I left Google so that I could criticize Google. Actually, I left so that I could talk about the dangers of AI without considering how this impacts Google. Google has acted very responsibly.
From the Times interview:
He still believed the systems were inferior to the human brain in some ways but he thought they were eclipsing human intelligence in others. “Maybe what is going on in these systems,” he said, “is actually a lot better than what is going on in the brain.”
As companies improve their AI systems, he believes, they become increasingly dangerous. “Look at how it was five years ago and how it is now,” he said of AI technology. “Take the difference and propagate it forwards. That’s scary.”
Until last year, he said, Google acted as a “proper steward” for the technology, careful not to release something that might cause harm. But now that Microsoft has augmented its Bing search engine with a chatbot — challenging Google’s core business — Google is racing to deploy the same kind of technology. The tech giants are locked in a competition that might be impossible to stop, Dr. Hinton said. 
Hinton added that he fears in the immediate term the internet is going to be quickly inundated with fake videos, photos, and news, and soon no one will “be able to know what is true anymore.”
He added that in the long term, he fears AI will eventually eclipse human intelligence.
“The idea that this stuff could actually get smarter than people — a few people believed that,” he said, adding “But most people thought it was way off. And I thought it was way off. I thought it was 30 to 50 years or even longer away. Obviously, I no longer think that.”
I now predict 5 to 20 years but without much confidence. We live in very uncertain times. It's possible that I am totally wrong about digital intelligence overtaking us. Nobody really knows which is why we should worry now.
Hinton also told the BBC that one of the leading dangers of AI is that “bad actors” will attempt to use it for “bad things”.
Current Google CEO Sundar Pichai has admitted that the company’s ChatGPT competitor, Bard, has developed “emergent properties,” meaning that it is learning things that it hasn’t been programmed to know, and that the AI’s behavior is something he does not “fully understand.”
Last month Elon Musk revealed that Google has long planned to create an AI God and that Musk has repeatedly warned the company’s owners against it.
Musk stated that Google’s ultimate goal is to “create digital super intelligence” or what he describes as a “digital god.”
The Twitter owner said that Co-Founder of Google, Larry Page, told him privately years ago the company’s larger agenda is to work toward Artificial General Intelligence.
Elon Musk says Google co-founder Larry Page once told him that he wants to build a ""Digital God"" using AI. pic.twitter.com/DMvME0ADfa
Musk co-founded OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT with Larry Page, but he is clearly genuinely concerned about the rapid advances in AI and how it could negatively impact humanity.
Musk told Tucker Carlson that it is “absolutely” conceivable that AI could take control and make decisions for people, which ultimately might lead to “civilizational destruction”.
“The danger, really, AI is perhaps more dangerous than, say, mismanaged aircraft design or production maintenance or bad car production in the sense that it has the potential, however small you want to regard that probability, but it is not trivial,” Musk warned.

29,Elon Musk Touts Twitter Fact Checks As “Ending Censorship In Guise Of Virtue”,https://www.infowars.com/posts/elon-musk-touts-twitter-fact-checks-as-ending-censorship-in-guise-of-virtue/,"Twitter owner Elon Musk has lauded the Community Notes feature on the platform, saying that the fact checking system is proving successful in “ending censorship in guise of virtue.”
Musk responded to a tweet by The Babylon Bee’s Seth Dillon stating “Twitter used to be a place where false narratives were protected and promoted. Now it’s a place where they’re challenged and corrected.”
Musk responded, “Ending censorship in guise of virtue, handing control of the narrative to the people and actually accurate fact-checking are essential goals.”
“Naturally, those who used to control the narrative and censored views they disliked are less than thrilled,” Musk further asserted, adding “How tragic.”
Ending censorship in guise of virtue, handing control of the narrative to the people and actually accurate fact-checking are essential goals.Naturally, those who used to control the narrative and censored views they disliked are less than thrilled. How tragic.
The Community Notes feature works by allowing all Twitter users to collaboratively add ‘context’ to posts. “If enough contributors from different points of view rate that note as helpful, the note will be publicly shown on a Tweet,” the platform states.
The system significantly reduces the risk of any partisan sources influencing the fact checks, as is apparent on other platforms such as Facebook where clearly non-independent actors are influencing content.
In a further post Wednesday, Musk again highlighted the Community notes feature when the so fact checkers Politifact were fact checked themselves over a post denying Teacher’s Union President Randi Weingarten’s previous staunch opposition to reopening schools after the pandemic.
Musk posted a pants emoji and and ‘on fire’ emoji:
👖 on 🔥
Musk also responded to another post adding much needed context to a story about a video of a man who was killed while “suffering a mental health crisis”: 
Jordan Neely loved to dance and perform.On Tuesday, while suffering a mental health crisis, he was choked to death while people watched and cheered.Jordan needed care. Instead, he was brutally murdered. This is not who we are as New Yorkers. pic.twitter.com/F4TmtlDEQW
Notes ftw again
The Twitter Community Notes feature is now adding true context to tweets, including those by Democrats and Joe Biden, who continue to make false claims:

30,Peter Schiff: The US Is in a Financial Crisis Worse than ’08,https://www.infowars.com/posts/peter-schiff-the-us-is-in-a-financial-crisis-worse-than-08/,"During his post-FOMC meeting press conference, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell insisted that the US banking system is resilient and sound. He said this despite the failure of First Republic Bank just days before the Fed meeting. Peter Schiff appeared on the Claman Countdown on Fox News and argued that Powell and others are wrong. He said the US economy is in a financial crisis worse than in 2008.
Andy Brenner, head of international fixed income at National Alliance Securities, also appeared in the segment. He started things off by saying problems in the banking sector are “not over by a longshot.”
Liz Claman asked Peter why the Fed raised rates another 25 basis points despite the shakiness in the banking sector. Peter said they did it because that’s exactly what the market expected.
“That’s what the Fed does — what the markets expect.”
But Peter said the move by the Fed isn’t going to do anything to bring inflation down.
“The elephant in the room with respect to inflation is the fiscal policy – the debt, not the ceiling – but the fact that we’re running these massive deficits. But until the Federal government reduces spending, these quarter-point increases are going to be completely ineffective.”
Peter said the problem is Powell refuses to call Congress out and mention that the driving force behind all of the inflation is reckless government spending.
“And as long as the government keeps spending, inflation is going to get worse, and so is the current financial crisis. Nobody wants to admit we’re in a financial crisis. It’s worse than the one we had in 2008. It’s just getting started. Ultimately, the Fed is going to cut. But it’s going to cut as inflation is accelerating.”
Liz played a clip of Jerome Powell saying that the Fed is now paying particular attention to tightening credit conditions and its impact on bank lending. She also pointed out that Peter has previously said that the Fed has screwed up everything that is a function of interest rates. So how will these things specifically impact the economy moving forward? Peter said it was going to affect banks in particular.
“I have warned for years that the banks could start collapsing for the precise reason that they’re collapsing now. The Fed kept interest rates at zero for so long. That’s what allowed these financial institutions to load up on overpriced, low-yielding Treasuries, mortgage-backed securities, and other loans. Plus, US government auditors from the FDIC encouraged the banks to buy these long-term Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities because they gave them favorable accounting treatment. The banks didn’t have to mark them to market as long as they could pretend they would hold them to maturity. So, the whole house of cards was erected by the Fed and the US government. And now it’s collapsing, and they’re acting like they have nothing to do with it. They’re trying to figure out how to put out a fire that they lit. And of course, they’re not putting out the fire. They’re pouring gasoline on it.”
Brenner noted that there are about $1.9 trillion in unrealized losses on bank books. Liz pointed out that a study from Stanford and Columbia Universities found 186 US banks are in distress. Brenner reiterated, “No question, the banking crisis is not over by a longshot.”
Peter said everybody who has debt is going to feel the pain of rising interest rates.
“It makes that debt hard to service. And of course, there’s a lot of debt that is still low because it hasn’t matured yet. A lot of corporations, a lot of people in the real estate market, particularly commercial real estate, borrowed money two, three, four, five years ago at a really low rate. And the higher rates are when those loans mature, it’s going to be that much harder for them to get the financing to roll them over. And then you have the prospect of very disorderly bankruptcies throughout the economy.”

31,The Fed Is Overindebted,https://www.infowars.com/posts/the-fed-is-overindebted/,"Behind closed doors, the report is already making the rounds in expert circles: if you follow the rules of sound commercial accounting, the United States Federal Reserve (Fed) has lost its equity and is, as common language would have it, bankrupt. What happened?
During spring 2020 (i.e., in a period of extremely low interest rates), the Fed purchased large amounts of government bonds and mortgage bonds to support the economy and financial markets during the covid crisis.
The Fed paid for the purchases by issuing vast amounts of new central bank money. This has created an enormous “money surplus” in the US interbank market, where banks lend money to one another. It is exactly in this market where the interest rates for all other credit markets are determined.
However, the excess money supply now exerts strong downward pressure on the interbank interest rates. Since this is not desirable from a monetary policy point of view—after all, the Fed is raising the key interest rate with the intention of making interbank credit more expensive, slowing down economic growth, and lowering inflation—the Fed’s Open Market Committee has decided to pay interest on the excess balances that the banks hold at the Fed.
This interest rate is currently 5.15 percent. This is close to the Fed’s official key interest rate, which is currently between 5.00 and 5.25 percent. In doing so, the Fed has set an interest rate limit in the interbank money market: no bank can lend its excess money supply for less than 5.15 percent if it gets this rate from the Fed.
In addition, the Fed grants “privileged nonbanks” the opportunity to conclude so-called reverse repurchase agreements with the Fed—this select group includes asset managers, investment companies, pension funds, and others. This agreement allows them to transfer the balances they and their customers do not need to the Fed “overnight” in exchange for interest-bearing securities. In return, they earn an interest rate of 5.05 percent, slightly below, but still close to, the minimum interest rate on the interbank market.
While this means that the Fed has full control over the interest rates in the money market, it is committed to making interest payments that are higher than the interest payments it receives on its securities portfolio. Since the Fed has been paying more interest than it collects for some time now, a massive negative interest result has built up on the Fed’s balance sheet. It is recorded as a balance sheet liability. The usual US Treasury retained earnings, which are positive under normal circumstances, were negative $54.5 billion as of April 12, 2023 (or negative $44.2 billion on a consolidated basis).
If, however, a book entry that the Fed shows on the liability side of its balance sheet (i.e., under its liabilities) has a negative sign, this means nothing other than that it reduces the overall debt. One can rightly become suspicious here: this accounting practice is hardly compatible with truth and clarity when it comes to balance sheet accounting. Rather, it obscures the fact that the Fed’s debt has effectively eaten away its reported equity, which was just $42.2 billion at the time. In other words, the Fed’s liabilities are greater than its assets; in commercial accounting terms, this means “overindebtedness.”
It is worth noting that the Fed’s book loss would be much larger if it were to report on its balance sheet the debt securities it purchases at market values (“mark-to-market”) rather than at historical cost. By the way, it is the Fed’s interest-rate-hiking spree that has security prices plummeting.
The Fed currently holds around $8.5 trillion in debt securities on its balance sheet. A price drop of just, let’s say, 5 percent on this debt portfolio would result in an accounting loss (an “unrealized loss”) of $425 billion, reducing the Fed’s equity capital by the same amount. (It should be noted here that if the Fed held the securities to maturity and the borrowers repaid them in full, the accounting loss would disappear by maturity.)
Any conventional company would be in dire straits under these circumstances. (By the way, failing to report a loss would be a punishable offense in many countries.) However, the Fed, like any other central bank, is not a conventional company. Rather, it has the state monopoly of money production, which makes it truly special.
The central bank can produce the money with which it needs to pay off its liabilities at any time and in any amount. However, a central bank cannot become insolvent like a traditional company. In fact, it could continue to operate even if its equity were depleted (i.e., if it were zero or negative, which is recorded on the assets side of its balance sheet).
Of course, the Fed’s lack of equity could be remedied. This would be the case, for instance, if the US Treasury transferred newly issued government bonds to the Fed for free. The Fed’s assets would increase, so the Fed’s equity would increase if and when its liabilities remained the same.
The gold reserves on the Fed’s balance sheet could also be revalued. Since the early 1970s, the Fed’s 261.5 million gold troy ounces have been valued at $42.22 per troy ounce, equivalent to $11.04 billion. At current prices, however, the gold on the Fed’s balance sheet has a market value of approximately $520 billion. That said, the revaluation of the Fed’s gold could produce a revaluation gain of around $510 billion—and bolster Fed equity accordingly.
While such a “cooking the books” could indeed “save” the Fed’s balance sheet, it doesn’t mean investors wouldn’t become concerned and have doubts about the whole US dollar construct. If the Fed has already run out of equity, what must the situation be like in the commercial banking sector? Also, if its balance sheet is already overstretched, will the Fed still be in a position to function as a “lender of last resort” in the next crisis?
The Fed’s balance sheet, in which liabilities exceed assets, is a red flag. Investors could lose confidence in the reliability and value of the US dollar and all currencies based on it. Who could blame investors if that eventually happened? In fact, the Fed’s negative equity is just another sign of the growing trouble in the world’s fiat money regime dominated by the US dollar.",0
32,Biden Fact Checked Into Oblivion By Twitter Community Notes After Touting ‘Record’ Job Creation,https://www.infowars.com/posts/biden-fact-checked-into-oblivion-by-twitter-community-notes-after-touting-record-job-creation/,"Joe Biden was once again ruthlessly fact checked by Twitter’s Community Notes after he posted a chart claiming that he has created more jobs than any of the other previous Presidents in recent memory, a blatant attempt to mislead Americans.
“This is what happens when you invest in America,” Biden tweeted, adding“We have more work to do – but this is real progress.”
The chart he posted along with those comments shows Biden having created close to 500,000 jobs on average per month since he took office.
It shows other Presidents job creation stats, going back to Reagan, all way lower than Biden’s.
Community Notes soon took over the post, however, with readers pointing out that Biden has not created significantly more jobs than the other Presidents, and the chart merely shows the recovery of jobs after the COVID pandemic and lockdowns, which happened under Trump.
This is what happens when you invest in America.We have more work to do – but this is real progress. pic.twitter.com/Pur91mu3Pf
Biden and his handlers are acutely aware of these facts, but purposefully attempted to mislead Americans.
I'll Community Note this for youVery misleading: In March of 2020 the US was locked down due to COVID. Unemployment skyrocketed & many lost their jobs.When Biden came into office, lockdowns were ending & everyone got their jobs back.Biden calls this 'job creation'
I'll add some context:These jobs weren't created, these are people going back to workThe per month is skewed because it's over a different time scale, it will likely not stay this high after the full 4 yearsLastly, this is largely driven by covid, not investing in America
I'm just going to sit back and wait to see how the community notes destroy this manipulative post.
The Community Notes feature works by allowing all Twitter users to collaboratively add ‘context’ to posts. “If enough contributors from different points of view rate that note as helpful, the note will be publicly shown on a Tweet,” the platform states.
The system significantly reduces the risk of any partisan sources influencing the fact checks, as is apparent on other platforms such as Facebook where clearly non-independent actors are influencing content.

“Naturally, those who used to control the narrative and censored views they disliked are less than thrilled,” Musk further asserted, adding “How tragic.”

33,World Food Prices Rising Again – UN,https://www.infowars.com/posts/world-food-prices-rising-again-un/,"The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations reported on Friday that global food prices grew in April for the first time in a year. 
The price index, which tracks the most globally traded food commodities, averaged 127.2 points last month, compared to 126.5 for March.
“The slight rebound in the FFPI (FAO Food Price Index) in April was led by a steep increase in the sugar price index, along with an upturn in the meat price index, while the cereals, dairy and vegetable oil price indices continued to drop,” the FAO said.
According to the report, the sugar price index soared 17.6% from March, hitting its highest level since October 2011. The rise was reportedly linked to concerns over tighter supplies following downward revisions to production forecasts for India and China, along with lower-than-expected output in Thailand and the European Union.
The meat price index was up 1.3% from March, while dairy prices fell 1.7%. Vegetable oil prices were also down 1.3%, marking the fifth consecutive monthly decline.
The cereal price index dropped 1.7%, with a decline in world prices of all major grains outweighing an increase in rice prices.
“The increase in rice prices is extremely worrisome and it is essential that the Black Sea initiative is renewed to avoid any other spikes in wheat and maize,” said FAO Chief Economist Maximo Torero.
The FAO report indicated that international wheat prices declined by 2.3% in April to their lowest level since July 2021, principally driven by large exportable availabilities in Russia and Australia.
According to the UN body, favorable crop conditions in Europe, along with an agreement at the end of April allowing Ukrainian grains to transit through European Union countries that had imposed import restrictions earlier in the month, also contributed to the “overall softer tone in markets.” 
Meanwhile, Torero projected that as global economies “recover from significant slowdowns, demand will increase, exerting upward pressure on food prices.”

34,Buffett Turns Gloomy: The “Incredible Period” For The US Economy Is Coming To An End,https://www.infowars.com/posts/buffett-turns-gloomy-the-incredible-period-for-the-us-economy-is-coming-to-an-end/,"While Warren Buffett’s insights on the economy are traditionally cheerful and uplifting – usually hitting at time of peak pessimism in the form of self-serving NYT op-eds or CNBC vignettes (and usually around the time the Omaha billionaire knows that the government will backstop his TBTF investments, unlike those of pretty much anyone else), on Saturday the head of Berkshire Hathaway had a far more downbeat and gloomy prediction for his own businesses – and the broader economy in general – the good times may be over.
Speaking at Berkshire’s annual general meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, the billionaire investor said he expects earnings at the majority of the conglomerate’s operations to fall this year as the coming economic downturn slows corporate activity further. He made his pessimistic comments even as Berkshire posted an almost 13% gain in operating earnings to $8.07 billion for the first quarter, up from $7.04 billion a year ago.
“The majority of our businesses will report lower earnings this year than last year,” Buffett, 92, said, before crowds of thousands at the event on Saturday according to Bloomberg. During the last six months or so, the “incredible period” for the US economy has been coming to an end, he said.

As Bloomberg notes Berkshire is often viewed as a proxy for economic health owing to the expansive nature of its businesses ranging from railroad to electric utilities and retail. Buffett himself has said Berkshire owes its success to the incredible growth of the US economy over the decades, but his prediction for a slowdown at his firms comes as upheaval at regional banks threatens to curtail lending as inflation and higher rates continue to bite.
Buffett’s long-time business partner Charlie Munger, 99, who joined him on stage, said the more-difficult economic environment will also make it harder for value investors, who typically buy stocks that look cheap compared to the intrinsic value of the businesses.
“Get used to making less,” Munger said.
Despite the broader pessimism, Buffett said he expects earnings at its insurance underwriting operations — which are less correlated to business activity — to improve this year. Berkshire already reported higher earnings at those businesses including auto-insurer Geico, which swung to profitability following six quarters of losses.
Geico posted $703 million in earnings as higher average premiums and lower advertising spending contributed to the gain even as claim frequencies fell, Berkshire said in a statement reporting its earnings Saturday. That revival follows a difficult period for the underwriting business as inflation took its toll on the cost of materials and labor.
Geico has been facing particular pressure from rivals including Progressive, which Buffett has called “well-run,” and Allstate which had long used telematics programs to track drivers and encourage better behavior before Geico introduced the offering. Geico’s profit also helped Berkshire’s insurance underwriting businesses deliver $911 million in profit compared with $167 million a year earlier.
Berkshire previously said it expected Geico to return to operating profitability in 2023, after securing premium rate increases. Still, Geico remains an issue for Berkshire, with top line growth in the quarter of less than 1% that “significantly lags peers,” CFRA analyst Cathy Seifert said.
“I suspect rate hikes being put through to offset claim cost inflation is being met with policy cancellations,” she said. “While the loss of unprofitable policies is not always a bad thing- that’s not usually the policies — and policyholders — that leave.”
Other parts of the conglomerate took a bigger hit, with after-tax earnings from Berkshire Hathaway Energy falling 46.3% from the same time last year amid “lower earnings from the US regulated utilities, other energy businesses and real estate brokerage businesses.” Railroad results were also weaker than expected due to a fall in freight volumes and higher operating expenses, according to Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan.
But at one of Berkshire’s best known businesses, Brooks Running Co., Chief Executive Officer Jim Weber was skeptical of a steep consumer downturn.
“With unemployment being so low, it’s hard to be believing we’re going to fall off a cliff into a recession at the consumer level,” Weber said in an interview on Friday ahead of the meeting. “I wonder if this is going to be an asset-value recession.”
Among other topics discussed on Saturday were Buffett’s succession, the banking crisis, the US debt ceiling crisis, the company’s investment in Occidental, Chna’s upcoming invasion of Taiwan and more:
Separately, Berkshire topped up its cash pile, ending the quarter with $130.6 billion, a $2 billion increase from the $128.6 billion at the end of the year. This means that Berkshire stands to make a bonanza from interest income as the Fed keeps hiking rates: “Our investment income is going to be a lot larger this year than last year, and that’s built in,” Buffett said at the annual meeting.
The company was also a net seller of equities for the second quarter in a row, pocketing $10.4 billion in net stock sales ($13.3 billion gross) after deducting purchases of $2.9 billion.
Finally, Berkshire bought back $4.4 billion of stock, an increase from the same period last year, as Bekrshire confronted turbulent markets that offered fewer of the blockbuster deals he’s renowned for. Berkshire has turned toward buybacks more often as valuations in public markets had made it more challenging for Buffett to identify promising acquisitions.",0
35,Falling Trade Deficit Suggests a Weakening US Economy,https://www.infowars.com/posts/falling-trade-deficit-suggests-a-weakening-us-economy/,"The March Trade Deficit decreased for the first time in four months. The total deficit came in at -$64.2B, which is the second smallest deficit since January 2021. This might seem like good news but it’s yet another indication of a weakening economy.
Figure: 1 Monthly Plot Detail
The table below provides detail.
Monthly Trade Deficit
Looking at Trailing Twelve Month:
Figure: 2 Trade Balance Detail
Historical Perspective
Zooming out and focusing on the net numbers shows the longer-term trend. The latest month suggests the trend of a shrinking deficit is not yet over. The deficit numbers have returned to a much choppier month-over-month look which was pretty standard before Covid. If the US economy and USD continue to weaken, driving Imports down and Exports up, the Trade Deficit could return to pre-Covid levels soon.
Figure: 3 Historical Net Trade Balance
That said, the Services Surplus seems to have stabilized at a new level. After Net Services hovered around 35% of Exported Services for some time, it has now found a new range between 25% and 30% suggesting the Services Surplus has faced a relative contraction.
Figure: 4 Historical Services Surplus
To put it all together and remove some of the noise, the next plot below shows the Trailing Twelve Month (TTM) values for each month (i.e., each period represents the summation of the previous 12-months). The global surge in consumption post-Covid is clear to see below, or, more likely, the global increase in prices. The black line is showing a mild recovery on a TTM basis as noted above.
Figure: 5 Trailing 12 Months (TTM)
Although the TTM Net Trade Deficit is near historical highs, it can be put in perspective by comparing the value to US GDP. As the chart below shows, the current records are still below the 2006 highs before the Great Financial Crisis.
The current value of 3.28% is moving back down but is still well above the 2.5% from before Covid.
Figure: 6 TTM vs GDP
The chart below shows the YTD values. Total Exports have actually increased while total Imports have decreased when compared to the same period last year.
Figure: 7 Year to Date
Wrapping Up
The Trade Deficit is down from the records set last year, but the US is still printing very large Deficits relative to history. It is not totally surprising to see the current trend. There could be a few reasons for falling Imports and rising Exports. It’s safe to rule out increased domestic production and productivity. It’s more likely a combination of a falling dollar and rising inflation.
Rising inflation has taken a bite out of American incomes which leaves less money for goods. This has shown up as a decrease in Imported Goods. The falling US dollar has also made US goods more attractive to foreigners. This explains why Exports have increased.
This is a trend that could continue. As the US enters recession, the Fed gives up its inflation fight, and the world moves to de-dollarize… it will be harder for US consumers to continue running up massive trade deficits. If anything, all the dollars out there will likely come back to the US, making the inflation problem worse.
It is wise to diversify away from the dollar and maintain purchasing power. The best way to do this is to own precious metals.

36,“Going To Be Bumpy” – World’s Largest Container Shipper Warns Of Downturn,https://www.infowars.com/posts/going-to-be-bumpy-worlds-largest-container-shipper-warns-of-downturn/,"The world has a handful of shipping companies, and one of the ones we follow is A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S, which warned of a “radically changed business environment” as profits declined in the first quarter due to slumping transport volumes and sliding freight rates, Financial Times reported. 
Maersk, which transports close to one-fifth of the world’s containers, beat analyst expectations in the first quarter but outlined earnings for the remainder of the year would be weaker. It said the first three months of 2023 “will be the best quarter of the financial year.” 
“Guidance for 2023 continues to be based on the expectation of a muted 2023 global GDP growth and that volume declines will stabilise by the end of H1, leading to a more balanced demand environment. In this normalization path, Q1 is expected to be the best quarter of the financial year.” 
Chief executive Vincent Clerc told the FT about a large influx of new vessels about to hit the world’s top shipping lanes ordered during the last several years. He expects those ships to be delivered in 2024. 
“It’s clearly going to be bumpy because there are quite a few coming this year and quite a few coming next year, too. The volumes are coming back after, but it’s not like the macroeconomic backdrop points to a lot of growth to take care of this,” he added.
During the first quarter, Maersk reported a 56% plunge in EBITDA, amounting to $3.97 billion, compared to analysts’ median estimate of $3.55 billion. The quarter saw a 9.4% reduction in volumes and a 37% drop in freight rates, which now hover near the break-even point.
In a separate interview, Clerc told Bloomberg there’s still a lot of uncertainty ahead as global business activity slows and companies race to reduce inventories at warehouses due to overstocking during the pandemic years. In return, demand for container ships has sunk on major shipping lanes from Asia to Europe and the US. The downturn in shipping began in late 2021 when container rates topped out. 
Simultaneously, the IMF trimmed its global-growth projections in its latest World Economic Outlook report, warning about the increasing risks of a ‘hard landing.’ 
And the days of overconsumption of goods, brought on primarily by fiscal stimulus, are over, and one of the main reasons global shipping lanes are slowing. When Maersk speaks, it’s worth a listen as economic storm clouds are gathering.

37,What the Fed Says Today Really Isn’t Relevant Tomorrow,https://www.infowars.com/posts/what-the-fed-says-today-really-isnt-relevant-tomorrow/,"Is the rate hike pause in play?
That question remains up for debate after the May Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting.
But when you break it all down, the underlying economic reality is far more important than the messaging coming from Powell and Company. And the underlying economic reality is that inflation isn’t beat and the economy is heading toward a cliff.
THE RATE HIKE AND BALANCE SHEET REDUCTION
At the May meeting, the Fed raised interest rates by another 25 basis points. That brings the target range for the Fed funds rate to between 5.0% and 5.25%. It was the 10th consecutive rate increase since March 2022.
The official FOMC statement gave some indication that the central bank might be prepared to pause rate hikes. The committee removed language saying that it still “anticipates that some additional policy firming may be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.” It replaced that with a statement saying, “In determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.”
The new language is reminiscent of verbiage in the statement released by the Fed before it paused rate hikes in 2006. Of course, that tightening cycle ultimately led to the subprime mortgage crisis, the 2008 financial crisis, and the Great Recession. It’s interesting to consider that it took nearly two years for the negative impact of those rate hikes to play out in the economy.
The FOMC statement emphasized that “the Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.”
We’re still a long way from 2%. In fact, core inflation ticked up in March and the GDP data released for the first quarter of 2023 also reveals underlying inflationary pressure.
The FOMC continues to claim that “the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in its previously announced plans.”
The problem with this statement is that it hasn’t come anywhere near reducing its balance sheet according to the plan it announced a year ago. In fact, it has never reduced its holdings of mortgage-backed securities by its $35 billion per month target. Even if the central bank met its balance sheet reduction target, it would take more than seven years for it to unwind all of the quantitative easing that it did during the pandemic.
POWELL’S MESSAGING
During his post-meeting press conference, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell tried to downplay a rate hike pause and slammed the door on the possibility of rate cuts this year. He emphasized that the Fed is now in a “data-dependent” mode and insisted that “a decision on a pause was not made today.”
We on the committee have a view that inflation is going to come down—not so quickly, it will take some time. In that world, if that forecast is broadly right, it would not be appropriate to cut rates.”
He also tried to sound a hawkish note, saying, “We are prepared to do more if greater monetary policy restraint is warranted.”
On the other hand, Powell said he thought the current interest rate level is close to being restrictive enough to slay the inflation dragon.
“Policy is tight, you see that in interest-rate sensitive activities and you are beginning to see it more and more in other activities. Once you put the [banking] credit tightening and the [Fed’s] quantitative tightening on top of that, I think we may not be far off, or possibly already, at that level.”
That would seem plausible if the CPI accurately reflected the extent of rising prices. But inflation is worse than the government data suggest. This CPI uses a formula that understates the actual rise in prices. Based on the formula used in the 1970s, CPI is closer to double the official numbers. If the CPI is running close to 12%, a 5% interest rate isn’t nearly tight enough.
It’s important to remember that inflation is an increase in the money supply. Price inflation measured by the CPI is a symptom of monetary inflation. Since 2008, the Fed has created nearly $8 trillion. The central bank can’t ring that amount of liquidity out of the system with 5% interest rates.
But it can burst a lot of bubbles and break a lot of things in an economy dependent on easy money with 5% interest rates.
Nevertheless, Powell continues to insist it is possible to meet the Fed’s inflation target and bring the economy to a “soft landing.” He based this on the initial signs of weakness in the labor market.
There are no promises in this, but it just seems to me that it’s possible that we can continue to have a cooling in the labor market labor market without the big increases in unemployment that have gone with many prior episodes.”
WHAT WILL BREAK NEXT?
As Peter Schiff said in a recent podcast, the Federal Reserve has screwed up everything that is a function of interest rates. Rate hikes have already precipitated a financial crisis that is still in its early stages. Despite Fed’s insistence that “the US banking system is sound and resilient,” government regulators seized control of First Republic Bank over the weekend and sold the majority of the bank’s operations to JP Morgan Chase. It was the third major bank failure this year and the biggest bank to collapse since the 2008 financial crisis. It was the second-largest bank by assets to fail in US history.
If we are to believe the mainstream narrative, the failures of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank were isolated events and do not reflect a broader problem in the banking system. But as we have reported, these bank failures are just the tip of the iceberg. A report by the Wall Street Journal cites a study from Stanford and Columbia Universities that found 186 US banks are in distress.
As Schiff pointed out, there are plenty of other things at risk of breaking in this bubble economy, no matter what Powell and the other central bankers are saying today. Ultimately, the Fed is going to reverse course to keep banks from failing, stop the auto industry from imploding, save the housing market, prop up the government, and bail out over-levered corporations.
“Today’s 1/4 point Fed rate hike, basically another price increase, won’t do anything to subdue inflation. Consumer prices still have a long way to rise due to past QE and will rise even further as a result of future QE as the Fed soon responds to a worsening financial crisis,” Schiff said in a tweet.
Today's 1/4 point #Fed rate hike, basically another price increase, won't do anything to subdue #inflation.  Consumer prices still have a long way to rise due to past QE and will rise even further as a result of future QE as the Fed soon responds to a worsening financial crisis.
As far as a “soft landing” goes, that seems as implausible as a big win against inflation. In an interview, Schiff said, “We’d be very lucky to escape with just a recession. I think this is a depression. We’re probably already in it. It’s just going to get worse.”
As just one example of the rot in the economy, the Conference Board Leading Economic Index (LEI) for the US fell by 1.2% in March. It was the 12th straight month of declines in the LEI.
No matter what Powell says, it’s only a matter of time before the Fed has to abandon the pretense of an inflation fight, pivot, and start cutting rates. Even if this tightening cycle brings down CPI in the next few months, it will only be temporary. The moment it is forced to reckon with the damage done by decades of easy money, it will return to easy money like a pig to mud — no matter what the central bankers are telling you today.",0
38,Establishment Economists Are Finally Realizing It’s Time To Pay The Piper,https://www.infowars.com/posts/establishment-economists-are-finally-realizing-its-time-to-pay-the-piper/,"The one thing about the financial world that never ceases to amaze me is how far behind the curve mainstream economists always seem to be. 
Not long ago we had both Janet Yellen and Paul Krugman, economists supposedly at the front of the pack, both proving to be utterly ignorant (or strategically dishonest) on the effects of central bank stimulus measures and the threat of inflation. In fact, they both consistently denied such a threat existed until they were crushed by the evidence.
This tends to be the modus operandi of top establishment analysts, and the majority of economists out there simply follow the lead of these gatekeepers – Maybe because they’re vying for a limited number of cushy positions in the field, or perhaps because they’re afraid that if they present a contradictory theory they’ll be ostracized. Economics is often absurdist in nature because Ivy League “experts” can be wrong time and time again and yet still keep their jobs and rise up through the ranks.  It’s a bit like Hollywood in that way; they fail upwards.
In the meantime, alternative economists keep hitting the target with our observations and predictions, but we’ll never get job offers from establishment publications because they’re not looking for people who are right, they’re looking for people that toe the line.
And so it goes. I look forward to the fast approaching day when all of these guys (and girls) proclaim frantically that “no one saw this crisis coming.” After things get even worse, they’ll all come out and say they actually “saw the crisis coming and tried to warn us.”
The hope is not so much to get credit where credit is due (because that’s not going to happen), but to wake up as many people who will listen as possible to the dangers ahead, and maybe save a few lives or inspire a few rebels in the process. In the case of establishment yes-men, the hope is that they get that left hook to the face from reality and lose credibility in the eyes of the public. They deserve to go down with the ship – Either they are disinformation agents or they’re too ignorant to see the writing on the wall and should not have the jobs they have.
The latest US bank failures seem to be ringing their bell the past couple of months, that’s for sure. In a survey managed by the World Economic Forum, over 80% of chief economists now say that central banks “face a trade-off between managing inflation and maintaining financial sector stability.” They now warn that price pressures look likely to remain higher for longer and they predict a prolonged period of higher interest rates that will expose further frailties in the banking sector, potentially compromising the capacity of central banks to rein in inflation.  This is a HUGE reversal from their original message of a magical soft landing.
Imagine that. The very thing alternative economists including myself have been “ranting” about for years, the very thing they used to say was “conspiracy theory” or Chicken Little doom mongering, is now accepted as fact by a majority of surveyed economists.
But where does this leave us?  After acceptance usually comes panic.
The credit crunch is just beginning and the absorbing of the insolvent First Republic Bank into JP Morgan is a median step to a larger crash. The expectation is that the Federal Reserve will step in to dump more stimulus into the system to keep it afloat, but it’s too late. My position has always been that the central banks would deliberately initiate a liquidity crisis through steady interest rate hikes. This has now happened.
The Catch-22 scenario has been accomplished. Just like the lead up to the 2008 credit crisis, all the Fed needed to do was raise rates to around 5% to 6% and suddenly all systemic debt becomes untenable. Now it’s happening again and they KNEW it would happen again. Except this time, we have an extra $20 trillion in national debt, a banking network completely addicted to cheap fiat stimulus and an exponential stagflation problem.
If the Fed cuts rates prices will skyrocket even more. If they keep rates at current levels or raise them, more banks will implode. Most mainstream analysts will expect the Fed to go back to near-zero rates and QE in response, but even if they do (and I’m doubtful that they will) the outcome will not be what the “experts” expect. Some are realizing that QE is an impractical expectation and that inflation will annihilate the system just as fast as a credit crisis, but they are few and far between.
The World Economic Forum report for May outlines this dynamic to a point, but what it doesn’t mention is that there are extensive benefits attached to the coming crisis for the elites. For example, major banks like JP Morgan will be able to snatch up smaller failing banks for pennies on the dollar, just like they did during the Great Depression. And, globalist institutions like the WEF will get their “Great Reset,” which they hope will frighten the public into adopting even more financial centralization, social controls, digital currencies and a cashless society.
For the average concerned citizen out there, this narrative change matters because it’s a signal that things are about to get much worse. When the establishment itself is openly acknowledging that gravity exists and that we are falling instead of flying, it’s time to get ready and take cover. They never admit the truth unless the worst case scenario is right around the corner.

Speaking at a press conference in Brooksville, the governor insisted that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is not wanted in his state.”We want to maintain this as the free state of Florida,” he said as quoted by one US media outlet.
DeSantis further alleged that the CCP is engaged in a “concerted effort to acquire farmland throughout the United States,” and argued that China should not be allowed to be “in charge of any food production,” equating food security with national security.
Relations between Washington and Beijing took a turn for the worse during the presidency of Donald Trump when the then-POTUS engaged in a veritable tariff war with China.
Things only turned worse under the Biden administration when the US moved to create a new military bloc AUKUS to oppose China’s interests in Southeast Asia and ramped up efforts to funnel weapons to Taiwan.

The disgraced Duke of York became a controversial figure after the extent of his cozy relationship with deceased pedophile Jeffrey Epstein emerged in 2019.
From The Telegraph:
The Duke of York is no longer a working royal, having been effectively sacked by his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth, following his disastrous Newsnight interview in November 2019 in which he failed to express any regret over his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender, or empathy for his victims.
It emerged last month that Queen Elizabeth realised how disastrous the Duke of York’s Newsnight interview had been as soon as she read the transcript.
Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein’s most well-known victims, said she was the victim of sex trafficking and abuse while she was underage, including by Prince Andrew on numerous occasions, both on Epstein’s private island in the Caribbean and in London.

Australia was without a doubt one of the most tyrannical countries in the world when it came to vaccine restrictions. The mandates lost thousands of people their jobs, destroyed families and even worse…killed millions and injured millions more. 
Now, people are demanding damages for the attack on civil liberties and humanity itself by joining in on a class action lawsuit. 
It is expected that many thousands more will join the suit. Australia has already paid out more than $7 million for vaccine discrimination and death, with thousands of people still waiting in line for their lawsuits to go through. 
There is one problem here. 
While the justice is deserved and people should continue to demand justice and support these lawsuits, it is not the solution. If people withdrew from the tyranny from day one and ignored the demands of the state into oblivion, this would not be an issue. If people listened to independent media who’ve warned of this tyranny for years previous to the actual rollout, it wouldn’t be an issue. 
People must take responsibility over their health, education, money and sustenance and stop depending on the state’s ownership over them.

John Kennedy (R-La.), a ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, grilled Biden Energy Secretary David Turk during hearings this week.
Video clips of Kennedy questioning Turk are going viral online with Twitter users saying the GOP politician destroyed the administration’s global warming proposal.
Sen. John Kennedy Destroys Energy Secretary David Turk’s Global Warming Proposal “You don’t know do you Mr. Secretary? You just want us to spend $50T and you don’t have the slightest idea whether it’s going to reduce world temperatures.”pic.twitter.com/7MyWthrBx8
“Give me your best estimate, just an estimate, of how soon you think the United States of America will be carbon neutral?” the senator began his questioning.
Turk answered, “So, I think, according to the climate scientists around the world, and certainly the cutting-edge scientists that we need to rely on here in the U.S., we’ve got to get carbon neutral by 2050, and I’m very comfortable with that target, and I think that’s the appropriate target.”
When Kennedy asked how much it would cost the nation to be carbon neutral by 2050, Turk couldn’t answer despite the senator repeatedly trying to pry a cost amount from him.
At some point, the energy secretary admitted the cost would at least be in the trillions of dollars.
After Kennedy told the Biden administration official some of his colleagues have estimated it could cost $50 trillion for the country to become carbon neutral by 2050, he asked how much that would lower global temperatures.
Turk again failed to provide an estimate regarding how much a carbon-neutral America would reduce temperatures around the world.
After Turk repeatedly danced around the answer, Kennedy cut him off, asking, “You don’t know do you?”
The senator continued, “You just want us to spend $50 trillion, and you don’t have the slightest idea whether it’s going to reduce world temperatures. Now I’m all for carbon neutrality, but you’re the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Energy, and you’re advocating we spend trillions of dollars to seek carbon neutrality and you can’t—and this isn’t your money or my money, this is taxpayer money—and you can’t tell me how much it’s going to lower world temperatures or you won’t tell me? You know, but you won’t.”
In a separate video being shared on Twitter, Kennedy asked Solar Energy Industries Association President Abigail Hopper why the government has to pay people to drive electric cars if they are “so swell.”
Hopper argued the government incentivizing citizens to buy electric vehicles isn’t “paying them to drive” but Kennedy suggested the tax breaks they get do just that.

“Hello ladies and gentlemen — and only ladies and gentlemen it is, and shall always be,” the Martin Luther King High School student began her address to the Riverside Unified School District board in a video posted to social media.

“I am an 18-year-old high school student and wanted to take this time to bring to your attention the current issue with biological men claiming they are women and in turn truly believing they are entitled to use women’s spaces,” she said.
The student discussed an incident last week at her school where a fight broke out after a transgender individual reportedly flashed his genitals and spat on female students in the female locker room.

There are multiple videos of him attacking other girls at the school in Riverside California.These types of incidences are occurring across America.  When… pic.twitter.com/g08jfXN6EN
“It was infuriating when I had seen video on social media,” the teen told the school board, adding, “but what was detrimental was the fact this man is and has been using the women’s restroom and locker room.”
“Firstly,” the student continued, “the question we must address is: why are we affirming the mental confusion of this boy and putting the safety of women in jeopardy by allowing mentally confused men to use the women’s spaces?”
At this point the audience in attendance broke out in cheers and applause.
“Of course, any male who claims he is a female will accept it, but what about the women? What about the true girls like myself, who are female down to our DNA, why don’t we ever get a say in whether or not we are comfortable with this? The truth is we aren’t. The majority of us aren’t and yet nothing has been done to protect the safety of these women.”
The teen concluded by imploring the board, which is ultimately responsible for student safety, to reform their transgender policies.
It’s encouraging to see students speaking out in defense of their rights because incidents like these are likely to persist until schools regain their sanity.",0
44,Texas Senate Passes Legislation Banning ‘Hostile Foreign Nations’ From Buying Farmland,https://www.infowars.com/posts/texas-senate-passes-legislation-banning-hostile-foreign-nations-from-buying-farmland/,"The Texas state senate passed legislation this week banning the purchase of farmland by citizens and entities linked to hostile foreign nations, a move which the author of the bill says will provide “sweeping state and national security protections.”
“This bill protects Texas farmland, oil and gas, rare earth materials and timber from being owned by foreign entities classified as hostile by the Director of U.S. National Intelligence for three consecutive reports. These nations currently include China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran,” wrote Sen . Lois Kolkhorst (R) following the passage of her legislation by a vote of 19-12 in the state Senate on April 26.
According to a 2022 threat assessment report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), China, Russia, Iran and North Korea pose the biggest threats to US national security. The report says that the CCP presents “the broadest, most active, and persistent cyber espionage threat to the U.S. Government and private sector networks.”
The Texas bill, SB 147, was introduced last November by Kolkhorst, and has the support of Gov. Greg Abbott (R). That said, the language of the original bill was toned down following criticism from some Democrats and locals over the bill banning property purchases of any individual who is “a citizen of China, Iran, North Korea, or Russia.”
In the final draft, the ban does not apply to lawful permanent residents, US citizens or dual citizens.
The property which the bill applies to includes agricultural land, improvements, mines and quarries, mineral deposits, and standing timber.
It also grants the Texas attorney general the authority to investigate potential violations if “reasonable suspicion” exists that an individual or entity making a property purchase is associated with one of the designated countries.
“Texas is rich in its natural resources and is home to invaluable strategic military bases and installations. With SB 147, we can protect our Texas food supply and energy resources as well,” wrote Kolkhorst – who built this legislation to dovetail with SB 2116 – the state’s “Lone Star Infrastructure Protection Act,” which makes it illegal for Texas governments and businesses to make critical infrastructure deals with entities from the banned list.
Texas Democrats are upset.
“Even with the amendments offered, this legislation still takes away the rights of an entire class of people without due process and solely on the basis of their national origin,” wrote Rep. Gene Wu, an outspoken critic of Kolkhorst’s legislation, adding that he’s “frustrated by the Senate’s passage of SB 147 in its current form.”
“National security is a serious issue, but if we are concerned about the actions of foreign governments, then legislation should only affect foreign governments and their agents,” Wu continued. “Our community will continue to work, in the Texas House, to eliminate the unnecessarily discriminatory aspects of this bill.”
Not all Texas Democrats…
State Sen. Juan “Chuy” Hinojosa, a co-author of SB 147, is the lone Democrat who voted in favor of the bill on Wednesday.
“We’re not trying to target people. We’re trying to target nations that pose a security risk to this great nation of ours,” he said. “It’s incorrect to say that this bill is discriminatory.”
“We should not overlook the point that many of these nations are a threat to our security,” Hinojosa continued, adding that these countries “have made it very clear that they want to destroy our country, destroy our democracy, destroy our way of life.”

45,Federal Judge BLOCKS Illinois ‘Assault Weapons’ Ban,https://www.infowars.com/posts/federal-judge-blocks-illinois-assault-weapons-ban/,"A federal judge temporarily blocked a bill banning so-called “assault weapons” in Illinois on Friday, arguing those filing lawsuits against the state for violating their Second Amendment rights have a strong case.
U.S. District Judge Stephen McGlynn issued a preliminary injunction against Democrat Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s Protect Illinois Communities Act (PICA), which bans the sale of semiautomatic rifles and high-capacity magazines.
Judge McGlynn argued PICA “obliterated” the rights of the people to defend themselves by banning hundreds of different types of firearms.
“While PICA was purportedly enacted in response to the Highland Park shooting, it does not appear that the legislature considered anindividual’s right under the Second Amendment nor Supreme Court precedent,” he wrote.
“Moreover, PICA did not just regulate the rights of the people to defend themselves; it restricted that right, and in some cases, completely obliterated that right by criminalizing the purchase and the sale of more than 190 ‘arms.'”
He also noted that plaintiffs suing the state for claiming the law violates their Second Amendment have a “reasonable likelihood” of winning their cases. 
In addition to banning many semiautomatic firearms, PICA also requires citizens to register their existing semiautomatic rifles with the government.
“The new law also requires existing owners of semi-automatic rifles to register their ownership, ensuring that law enforcement knows the location of these weapons of war and who to hold accountable if they fall into the wrong hands,” Pritzker’s office said in a statement after the governor signed the bill into law in January.
Sheriffs in over 80 Illinois counties vowed not to enforce the gun ban, calling it a “clear violation” of the Second Amendment.
Edwards County Sheriff Darby Boewe had released the following statement after the bill was signed into law:
Part of my duties that I accepted upon being sworn into office was to protect the rights provided to all of us, in the Constitution. One of those rights enumerated is the right of the people to KEEP and BEAR ARMS provided under the 2nd Amendment. The right to keep and bear arms for defense of life, liberty and property is regarded as an inalienable right by the people.",0

Since the aftermath of the stolen 2020 Presidential election, Americans have become more alert to the growing threat of election fraud in the United States, a problem which both political party establishments are reluctant to address.
Election Operatives Secretly Meeting At DC Spy Museum
According to a November 2022 poll conducted by The Trafalgar Group, 56.8 percent of American voters don’t fully trust that America’s elections are fair and accurate. This is an astounding number, because it means that majority of Americans have lost trust in the integrity of our elections.
The increasing distrust in elections can largely be attributed to mail in ballot fraud, and Big Tech election interference, issues that have been downplayed by many elections officials on a national level.
And now, ahead of the 2024 Presidential election, a group of some of the nation’s most notorious election fraud deniers and election officials, including Secretaries of State, are set to have a secret Elections summit in Washington DC from May 8-May 9 called “Summit on American Democracy”. One would think that Election officials who are concerned about Democracy would be transparent with their actions, and invite members of the public to attend their summit. But, this upcoming election summit is “invite only” and not open to the public. Additionally, in their effort to openly mock election integrity advocates who they have dismissed and defamed as “conspiracy theorists”, the summit is being hosted at the “International Spy Museum” in Washington DC.
The Center for Election Innovation & Research (CEIR) is organizing and hosting the conference. CEIR was founded in 2016 by David Becker, who also founded the Election Official Legal Defense Network (EOLDN). Becker previously worked at Pew Charitable Trusts, where he organized the creation of the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC). Prior to working at Pew, Becker was the Director of People for the American Way (PFAW) and also worked in the U.S. Department of Justice as a litigator. However, in 2005, a formal ethics complaint was filed against Becker when he was a trial lawyer in the Civil Rights Division of the DOJ. At the time, Brad Scholzman, was the acting head of the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights division, and he said Becker did one of “the most unethical things I’ve ever seen” and called Becker “a hard-core leftist and a classic case of someone who should have been disbarred.” Scholzman also added that Becker “Couldn’t stand conservatives.”
Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC) is a multi-state partnership which claims to allow states to share voter registration data with each other. It is currently used by over 30 states within the United States, but its critics argue that it enables election fraud and violates data privacy.
CEIR describes itself as a “nonpartisan nonprofit that conducts elections research and works with election officials from around the country and both sides of the aisle. to support elections that voters should—and do—trust.
However, founded by Becker, a hard core Leftist activist, CEIR is documented as being a SOROS tied advocacy group that provides grants and conducts research to increase Democrat voter turnout in swing states. Becker created CEIR in 2016 in response to President Trump’s election, which Becker claims was the result of “foreign interference”. However,Becker and CEIR clearly have no issue with election interference, because in August 2020, less than three months before the Presidential election, CEIR accepted $69.5 million from Facebook founder and billionaire Mark Zuckerberg and his Chinese wife, Priscilla Chan to create more mail in ballot drop boxes in key swing states under the guise of “COVID-19 safety precautions”.
David Becker wrote a book titled, “The Big Truth: Upholding  Democracy in the Age of the Big Lie.” His book paints all MAGA supporters who question the legitimacy of the 2020 election results as naive, brainwashed, or subject to an effective disinformation campaign. Mind you, Becker not only believes, but also perpetuated the lies that Russia interfered with the 2016 election, that Jan 6th was a “violent insurrection”, and that the 2020 election was the most transparent and verifiable election in US history.
Becker’s upcoming summit has an invite only hidden guest list, and a Speaker list and agenda that currently features six Secretary of States (NV RI, CO, GA,NM, NJ), Major Garrett, CBS New’s Chief Washington correspondent, Sarah Longwell, Publisher of The Bulwark, an American anti-Trump conservative news and opinion website, and Ben Ginsburg, the Co-Chair of the Election Official Legal Defense Network (EOLDN).
Of the election officials who are listed as speakers at the CEIR summit, some have received national exposure for their refusal to look thoroughly into reported voter fraud in the 2020 and 2022 elections, including Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, Gabe Sterling, the chief operating officer of Georgia’s Office of the Secretary of State, and Bill Gates, the County Supervisor in Maricopa County, Arizona. 
These elected officials have been brought together and invited to speak by David Becker because of their use of ERIC, the program he created. ERIC is a voluntary contract membership between states and ERIC. States that use ERIC must pay up to $2 million of tax-payer- money annually. In March of 2023, Becker resigned from ERIC after three GOP states dropped ERIC due to Becker’s radical Leftist associations and financial ties to George Soros and Mark Zuckerberg.
Instead of taking responsibility for being a partisan hack, Becker blamed his resignation from ERIC on “attacks from election deniers”. Becker profusely denies his Soros ties, but there are countless articles proving that his work was and still is funded by George Soros, and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. Even though Becker denies his ties to Soros, in his book, he mentions that he worked at Pew Charitable Trusts, a part of Open Society Foundations, which is a grant making network founded and chaired by George Soros.
According to the CEIR website:
“ ERIC is a tool that I [David Becker] helped create in 2012. It is a nonprofit, run by states that voluntarily choose to be members, that helps make them identify voters who have moved, voters who have died, and possible instances of illegal double voting. It also assists states in directing potentially eligible voters to secure and convenient voter registration, instead of less-secure and burdensome paper registration forms. I [David Becker] served on the ERIC board as a non-voting member for nearly its entire existence, until last week, when my term expired, and I informed ERIC that I would not accept renomination as a non-voting member of the board.”
After being exposed as a radical Left-wing activist who pretends to be non-partisan in an effort to interfere with the outcome of US elections in key swing states (with funding from Soros and Zuckerberg), it appears that Becker is using CEIR to continue his partisan election activism, but behind closed doors.
It should concern all American voters that elected officials, including Secretary of States are secretly convening in our nation’s capital ahead of the 2024 Presidential election with a Leftist activist who resigned in disgrace and has a documented history of acting in an unethical and corrupt manner to push his Leftist political agenda.
While CEIR’s website only features about eight speakers as of now, the agenda for the summit indicates that there are several panels and additional speakers who have not been listed on the site. However, the event is invite only by design to conceal the contents of the summit from the public. The Election Official Legal Defense Network (EOLDN) is a project of CEIR, and is listed on CEIR’s website. EOLDN says its purpose is to connect licensed, qualified, pro bono attorneys with election administrators who need advice or assistance. As a branch of CEIR, EOLDN advisory board members have also been invited to attend the secret election summit in DC.
EOLDN’s advisory board consists of Supervisors of Elections, Secretaries of State, election clerks, and directors of elections from all across the country, but specifically in key swing election states.
To put into perspective why this closed-door secret summit is problematic, it serves to undermine not only the integrity of our elections through a lack of transparency, but it also undermines the judicial system. For example, Kari Lake, the Republican candidate for Governor of Arizona in 2022 is in the middle of an appeal regarding her lawsuit contesting the results of her election. Named in her lawsuit are several Arizona elections officials, including Bill Gates (Gates serves on the Maricopa County Election Board of Supervisors), who is listed as an attendee of the summit.
Elections officials are supposed to be non-partisan. However, on December 22, 2022, Gates tweeted a picture of his statement, celebrating a court ruling against Lake in her lawsuit against her Democrat opponent, Katie Hobbs. Partisan statements from elections officials are not only inappropriate, but they are unethical and further prove that election officials have partisan agendas.
According to Election Official Legal Defense Network’s (EOLDN) website, Lisa M. Marra, the Deputy Director of Elections for Arizona’s Secretary of State, and Stephen Richer, the ElectionsRecorder in Maricopa County, AZ are also EOLDN advisory board members who are likely to attend the secret upcoming CEIR summit . Maricopa County was the focus of national controversy surrounding election fraud in both 2020 and 2022. While running for Governor of Arizona, Lake’s opponent, Democrat Katie Hobbs, was the Secretary of State of Arizona. In other words, Hobbs was able to oversee the outcome of her own election as Arizona’s Secretary of State, the leading election overseer. Gates, Marra, and Richer all worked under Hobbs, and are advisory board members of Soros and Zuckerberg tied EOLDN, a CEIR offshoot which provided them legal counsel to combat Lake’s highly supported claims of voter fraud.
Why are Maricopa County Supervisor Bill Gates, Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer, and Lisa M. Marra, the Deputy Director of Elections for Arizona’s Secretary of State’s office heavily involved in a far Left election conference while the election lawsuits of Kari Lake, Abe Hamadeh and Mark Finchem are still ongoing? Gates and Richer are licensed attorneys, who are both subject to Rules of Professional Conduct that established policies which state licensed attorneys may not “engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice” (Rule 8.4(d)). Their advisory board membership with EOLDN and their participation in the upcoming CEIR conference is grounds for citizens to file bar complaints against them. These bar complaints would actually be legitimate, as opposed to the frivolous bar complaints the Left and their advocacy groups are constantly filing against conservative election attorneys.
To learn more about how you can file a Bar complaint against Maricopa County Supervisor Bill Gates, and Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer for professional misconduct, click here.
It is worth noting that in February 2023, Lisa Marra, the elections director of Cochise County, Arizona, resigned from her job after two Republican county supervisors, Tom Crosby and Peggy Judd, filed a lawsuit against her to urge her to conduct a 100 percent hand count of the 2022 midterm election, which she refused to do. Marra’s resignation came days before a scheduled public meeting in Arizona regarding voting machines, where members of the public and voter fraud experts were scheduled to speak and show evidence of election fraud in Arizona.
It is laughable that these election officials claim to be non-partisan when they are attending partisan election summits in secret. How can voters in the United States of America, especially in a state like Arizona, possibly have trust in, and feel comfortable about the security of their elections when their top state and county election officials are having secret, closed door meetings at a summit organized by David Becker, a known Leftist activist and Trump hater, who is financed by Leftist mega donors like George Soros and Mark Zuckerberg?
The answer is simple.

Footage of an encampment in a sandy area near Loop 375 on the U.S. side of the border was published on social media by Rep. Tony Gonzales (R-TX) on Thursday. 
“The video no one is showing you – A few miles from downtown El Paso on the US side of the border there are 100s of illegal migrants camping out. This is anything but orderly and humane,” Rep. Gonzales wrote on Twitter.

The Proud Boys founder and leader, Enrique Tarrio, as well as members Joe Biggs, Ethan Nordean, and Zachary Rehl, all face a maximum of 20 years in prison for the charge of seditious conspiracy.
Here’s the definition of “seditious conspiracy” from 18 U.S. Code § 2384:
If two or more persons in any State or Territory, or in any place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, conspire to overthrow, put down, or to destroy by force the Government of the United States, or to levy war against them, or to oppose by force the authority thereof, or by force to prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of the United States, or by force to seize, take, or possess any property of the United States contrary to the authority thereof, they shall each be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.
Tarrio was also found guilty of “obstructing Congress’ certification of President Joe Biden’s electoral victory,” and “obstructing law enforcement as well as two other conspiracy charges,” the Associated Press reports.
Here’s a report on the verdicts from Fake News CNN:

The jury reached the verdict despite evidence showing FBI informants infiltrated Proud Boy chat rooms and planted evidence.
CBS NEWS reports on why the jury only delivered a “partial” verdict:
There was no verdict for Dominic Pezzola on the most serious charge, seditious conspiracy, and conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding. After the reading of the partial verdict, Judge Timothy Kelly sent the jury back to deliberate on these charges and several other felonies that they did not come to verdict on.  ",0

Awkward.
The controversy began after Clinton tweeted, “Over 50% of the attempted book bans last year involved books with LGBTQ+ characters & themes. Books are a vital way that children, adolescents and adults learn about themselves and our world. Bans such as these are nothing but harmful.”

Aside from the erroneous claim that the books are being ‘banned’ (they’re simply being removed from school libraries), the very book shown in the tweet has every reason to be kept away from children.
A community note added to Clinton’s tweet revealed the awful truth.
“Gender Queer”, the book shown in the photo, features sexually explicit material. This book contains visual depictions of oral sex, masturbation and adult sexual contact with a minor,” said the fact check.
Multiple people had informed Clinton of this fact shortly after she posted the tweet, but the daughter of sex pest Bill Clinton has yet to update, clarify or retract her original tweet.

Leftists despise community notes because they are non-partisan and largely accurate, unlike other ‘fact checks’ which have proven to be highly biased and inaccurate.
Ben Shapiro responded to Clinton by asking, “Why do you believe that young children must have access to cartoons of teenage boys performing oral sex on each other, Chelsea?”

51,Texas AG Ken Paxton Launches COVID-19 Vaccine Investigation into Big Pharma Gain of Function Research,https://www.infowars.com/posts/texas-ag-ken-paxton-launches-covid-19-vaccine-investigation-into-big-pharma-gain-of-function-research/,"Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced he’s launching an investigation into whether the major pharmaceutical companies engaged in gain of function research and misled the public about it.
Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson, the manufacturers of the experimental COVID mRNA vaccine, will be investigated for potential violations of the state’s Deceptive Trade Practices Act, the New York Post reported.
“The catastrophic effects of the pandemic and subsequent interventions forced on our country and citizens deserve intense scrutiny, and we are pursuing any hint of wrongdoing to the fullest,” Paxton said in a statement.
“This pandemic was a deeply challenging time for Americans,” he continued. “If any company illegally took advantage of consumers during this period or compromised people’s safety to increase their profits, they will be held responsible. If public health policy was developed on the basis of flawed or misleading research, the public must know.”
“This vested interest…combined with reports about the alarming side effects of vaccines, demands aggressive investigation,” he continued.
Paxton is demanding documents from the COVID shot producers related to “decision-making behind pandemic interventions forced on the public, especially when a profit motive or political pressure may have compromised Americans’ health and safety.”
Paxton’s probe “could have widespread implications for the legal immunity granted to manufacturers of the COVID-19 vaccines and open the door to class-action lawsuits from people injured by the mRNA jabs, amid reports of rare but serious adverse effects,” the New York Post’s Miranda Devine wrote.
This comes after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) called for a grand jury investigation into “crimes and wrongdoing committed against Floridians related to the COVID-19 vaccine.” 
“The Biden administration and pharmaceutical corporations continue to push widespread distribution of mRNA vaccines on the public, including children as young as 6 months old, through relentless propaganda while ignoring real-life adverse events,” DeSantis’ office said in a statement in December. 
“These risks include coagulation disorders, acute cardiac injuries, Bell’s palsy, encephalitis, appendicitis, and shingles.” 
“We’ll be able to get the data whether they want to give it or not. In Florida, it is illegal to mislead and misrepresent, especially when you are talking about the efficacy of a drug,” he added.
A recent Pfizer report shows the company knew its COVID vaccine posed high rates dire fetal and infant health risks as early as 2021 but encouraged pregnant women, with the help of health institutions like the CDC and FDA, to take the COVID shot anyway. ",0

Kennedy Jr., the nephew of President John F. Kennedy, clarified his views on climate and pollution issues during a recent interview.
Appearing on The Kim Iversen Show Tuesday, RFK Jr. said, “Climate issues and pollution issues are being exploited by the World Economic Forum and Bill Gates and all of these big mega-billionaires the same way that COVID was exploited – to use it as an excuse to clamp down top-down totalitarian controls on society and to give us engineering solutions.”
Continuing, he explained the globalists are using the climate crisis to further divide the rich and poor and suggested free market capitalism as the way to truly come up with innovative ways to protect the environment.
Despite being a Democrat politician who supports some liberal climate change policies, RFK Jr. at least admits the globalist control freaks are weaponizing “global warming” to force their authoritarian Great Reset nightmare on the people of the world.

The couple announced an amicable split on social media which immediately was picked up by the AP, but nobody thought they’d see Momoa out with anyone new quite so soon. Davidson, who has been romantically linked to nearly every woman on the planet, most recently Kim Kardashian, has reportedly swooped in quickly to get in on Momoa’s hunky, manly body.
“The dude is fucking awesome in Aquaman,” Davidson told a reporter for TMZ. “I’ve never felt super into dudes, but one look at Jason with his shirt off throughout the entire runtime of that movie, and I challenge any man not to get erect. It’s just not possible.”
Davidson is known for his whirlwind relationships, and friends of Momoa are already concerned for his well-being.
“Jason is one big, badass dude,” said friend Timothée Chalamet, who recently starred in the epic film DUNE with Momoa. “Nobody is saying that Jason can’t take care of himself, but on the inside he’s a big soft teddy bear, and I just hope that Pete doesn’t screw around with his feelings.”
Momoa and his reps could not be reached for comment. According to sources, his ex Lisa Bonet – best known for her role as Denise Huxtable on The Cosby Show – is “completely broken up” about Momoa being seen out so soon with someone new.
“She knew he’d eventually start seeing someone else, but didn’t know it would be this fast,” said a friend of Bonet’s who asked to remain anonymous. “I mean, Jason could have any woman on this planet, and Lisa knows that. Hell, God knows I’ve jilled-off to thoughts of him before. So Lisa expected someone to come along eventually, but I think we’re all surprised that it’s Pete Fucking Davidson.”

1,Former President Trump Calls Kyle Rittenhouse a ‘Modern-Day Hero’ In Leaked Private Recordings,https://empirenews.net/former-president-trump-calls-kyle-rittenhouse-a-modern-day-hero-in-leaked-private-recordings/,"“Mr. Ex-President is, naturally, very excited about this outcome,” says an anonymous source. “He loves Kyle, and has consistently been referring to the teen as a ‘modern day hero’ after what happened in Wisconsin.” 
Publicly, President Joe Biden has been very avoidant of commenting too heavily on his feelings about Kyle Rittenhouse’s arrest and subsequent trial. When Rittenhouse was acquitted last week, the Biden administration issued a statement simply acknowledging that “the jury system works, and we have to abide by it,” hinting heavily that he didn’t agree with the verdict. But Trump has been pushing in the exact opposite direction.
“Oh man, Mr. Ex-President is jumping for joy over this outcome,” says an anonymous source who works for Trump. “He threw a huge party the night of the verdict. It was like a birthday party for a deranged toddler – there were pony rides and balloons and cupcakes featuring little automatic rifles drawn in frosting. He even set up a ‘pin the tail on the looter’ section, with giant pictures of African American rioters hung on the wall, and blindfolded guests trying to stick them with giant pins. Of course, Trump fell asleep about 45 minutes into the party, but we still had a blast regardless. Kid Rock played. It was kind of wild.”
Another source claims that Trump and Rittenhouse have actually been texting each other since the verdict, bonding over their love for misplaced violence, a completely corrupt and failing justice system, and their mutual disregard for African Americans.

2,Kraft Foods To Re-Brand ‘Kool-Aid Man’ Mascot to ‘Kool-Aid Person’ After Pressure From Left-Wing Groups,https://empirenews.net/kraft-foods-to-re-brand-kool-aid-man-mascot-to-kool-aid-person-after-pressure-from-left-wing-groups/,"Extended pressure from left-wing groups, including The People’s Inclusion Group and Folks Against Transphobia have forced Kraft to retire their longtime mascot in favor of a more “progressive” and “politically correct” character.
“The Kool-Aid Man has been a staple of our brand since the 1950s, and we thought he’d be here for the long haul,” said Kraft spokesman Ruby Sugar. “Of course, when he was created back then, the world was a different place, and we never thought we’d have to make a judgement call about the fictional gender of a fictional mascot.”
The company said that the typical giant pitcher filled with red liquid would continue to look functionally the same, but that the character would also now appear sometimes in a dress, or with more “feminine” features, or will appear with other liquid colors, such as pink or purple – but will keep the same ‘OH YEAH!’ catchphrase it has always used.
“We are still going to keep it a pitcher of course, and we are still going to have it busting through walls,” said Sugar. “Of course, whenever we show the brick walls busting, that version of Kool-Aid Person will still have the more ‘masculine’ features, as it wouldn’t be as believable for a more feminine pitcher to be shattering through solid walls. Women aren’t usually strong enough for that.”
The change is expected in late Q1 of next year. Food collectors are already scrambling to get their hands on current packages displaying the Kool-Aid Man before the switch.

3,"Multiple People Hospitalized, Several Arrested During ‘Rush Limbaugh Has Cancer’ Celebration in Boston",https://empirenews.net/multiple-people-hospitalized-several-arrested-during-rush-limbaugh-has-cancer-celebration-in-boston/,"Over a dozen people were hospitalized and 11 people were arrested after a massive celebration broke out in the streets of Boston on Friday.
Last week, conservative dickbag Rush Limbaugh announced he had late-stage lung cancer, and liberals across the country let out a massive cheer. In Boston, a public celebration took place during the afternoon on Friday, with an estimated 35,000 people in attendance outside of Fenway Park.
“When I heard that Rush was going to die, I couldn’t wait to celebrate,” said Rick Baker, 39, of Boston. “If there were ever a more worthless, piece of shit, talking head on radio and TV, I don’t know who it is. I heard about the party on the radio Friday morning, called out of work, and headed down to the park  to party.”
Boston Police Department say that the gathering was not authorized, but they caught wind of the party on social media, and were able to send a “significant number of police officers” to the area to keep things under control.
“We were able to keep things really under control under the conservative protestors showed up,” said Boston Police Chief Frank R. Green. “The people who were there to enjoy the celebration were great. Unfortunately, some Rush supporters spoiled the fun. In the end, we arrested multiple people and our police forces had to, sadly, beat down many protestors who did not listen to directions to vacate the area.”
Green said that none of the “Rushers” had life-threatening injuries, and that most would be out of the  hospital within a few days.
“Next time, perhaps these people will listen,” said Green. “If a group of people want to celebrate the inevitable death of a world class piece of shit, we will support that. If you want to get in the way of that, we will ensure that you’re dealt with accordingly.”
Rush Limbaugh, who for some stupid reason received the Presidential Medal of Freedom last week, ensuring that it is now 100% meaningless, could not be reached for comment.

4,Trump To Host Massive ‘I Beat Impeachment’ Party at White House This Weekend,https://empirenews.net/trump-to-host-massive-i-beat-impeachment-party-at-white-house-this-weekend/,"President Trump has decided to throw a massive “I Beat Impeachment” party at the White House, which is slated to kickoff around 6PM on Saturday, with plans to run until the early morning hours on Monday.
“This is going to be the biggest, and best event that the White House has ever seen,” said President Trump. “When you’re the best, you want to have the best parties, and invite the best celebrities, and it’s going to be huge. Just huge. I’m very excited to have people join me for this mega-rager.”
Trump went on to say that several celebrity guests were scheduled to appear, including Eli Manning, Rush Limbaugh, Ted Nugent, and a “variety of Playboy Playmates” from the last several years.
“Oh man, the amount of planning this has taken is immense,” said a White House staffer who preferred to stay anonymous. “When the President parties, it’s a big deal. We need to include a barrage of cocaine and alcohol to keep the guests happy, and I’ll tell you right now – if you think the impeachment was a waste of taxpayer money, the cost of this party is going to put that to shame.”
Musical guests scheduled to perform include Kanye West, Dire Straits, and The Jesus and Mary Chain.

5,Parent Company of Corona Beer Sues China Over Bad Press During Their Coronavirus Scare,https://empirenews.net/parent-company-of-corona-beer-sues-china-over-bad-press-during-their-coronavirus-scare/,"Anheuser-Busch InBev, the parent company of Corona brands of beer, has announced they are filing suit against the Chinese government, after the massive Coronavirus scare in that country has caused a mass panic and multiple deaths. AB InBev claims that the bad press of deaths, mixed with the satiric natures of internet memes connecting “coronavirus” with Corona beers has caused them a loss of tens of millions of dollars.
“Anheuser-Busch InBev feels that the Chinese government is solely responsible for putting the bad taste in people’s mouths regarding the name Corona,” said AB InBev spokesman Rick Barker. “The lack of their medical care, the lack of their preparation, has lead to a massive outbreak of the Coronavirus in China, and as such, has lead to a massive souring of our brand here in the United States.”
The lawsuit, which claims nearly $200 million in damages, was filed in a superior court in Beijing, and names several specific government officials and medical personnel.
“While Corona beer has never been particularly popular in the United States with anyone, outside of those who hate the taste of good beer so prefer swill that you have to add fruit to in order to drink it, but that’s not the point,” said Barker. “We are already feeling the pinch of this Coronavirus, and sales figures are dwindling daily. It’s only a matter of time before the connection becomes a total mixture of truth and reality, and people stop drinking Coronas all together because they think they’ll get sick from it. They will, but that’s because it’s garbage beer, not because it’s got any virus in it.”

6,Gwyneth Paltrow’s Vagina-Scented Candle Is Reportedly Giving People Herpes in Their Nasal Passages,https://empirenews.net/gwyneth-paltrows-vagina-scented-candle-is-reportedly-giving-people-herpes-in-their-nasal-passages/,"Gwyneth Paltrow, who has been shilling garbage Goop products for years – items that have been proven multiple times to be a sham at best, and potentially life-threatening in their bad pseudoscience at worst. But her latest endeavor, Goop candles that smell like her former A-list vagina, have added a new treat for people dumb enough to buy it – the candles are giving people herpes in their nose.
Paltrow, perhaps best known for playing Robert Downey Jr.’s love interest, Pepper Potts, in the Iron Man films, has fallen to the levels of midnight pitchman over the last few years, and for some reason thought that selling candles scented specifically like her putrid pussy would be hot sellers. Somewhat confusingly, she appears to be right, as the candles are selling, but as they are made from the “natural juices” of Paltrow’s poon, they smell like her vagina, and are also causing people who burn the candle too long to contract herpes.
“I first noticed that I had a weird bump on the outside of my nose,” said Kirk Brown, who has estimated he’s spent around $2,000 on several hundreds of Paltrow’s candles. “I thought it was a pimple. It happens. After it got severe, and I started to feel the bumps in my nose, I went to the doctor. A test confirmed it was nose herpes. I didn’t even know it was possible!”
“I only burned one of her candles for a very short time,” said Melissa Rogers of Atlanta. “I got it as a gag gift from a co-worker at Christmastime. It smelled horrendous; like a cross between stale pee and the cheese you scrape out of an infected vagina. I was not a fan. I became less of a fan when it became clear that I was getting nose herpes. It’s hugely embarrassing.”
Multiple people say they have had similar experiences, and a lawyer has been contacted in at least one of the cases in hopes of a class-action suit. Reps for Gwyneth Paltrow’s vagina could not be reached for comment.

7,Michelle Obama Files For Divorce After Shocking Revelation; Barack Obama Admits: ‘I’m Gay!’,https://empirenews.net/michelle-obama-files-for-divorce-after-shocking-revelation-barack-obama-admits-im-gay/,"Former President Barack Obama announced late last night that he had filed for divorce from his wife of 27 years, Michelle Obama, after he revealed a secret double life as a homosexual.
“It is with a bit of sadness and a whole lot of relief that I announce that Michelle and I have decided to separate, as I have admitted to her, as I’m doing now to the rest of the world, that I am a homosexual,” said Barack Obama. “This may come as a shock to many, and anger others, but this is my personal business, and I would hope that everyone could respect my privacy at this time”
Representatives for Michelle Obama said that she and the former president would split amicably, and that Michelle herself was “not particularly shocked” by the revelation.
“We are very close, as close as two people could ever be, really,” said Michelle in a prepared statement. “I’ve known for many years about Barack’s secret life, and I fully support him in the direction that his life takes him. He was and is an incredible leader, a loving father and family man, and now he can go on to make some other guy, or multiple guys, very happy.”
“Honestly, I was prepared to just stay with her,” said Barack. “I think she’s secretly know for years that I was gay, and since it already came out in every conservative news site years ago that Michelle was actually born a man, I figured that was close enough. I was prepared to stick it out and keep having young guys on the side. Michelle nixed it, though. She said if this was going to become public news, then there’s no reason we shouldn’t just split up and reveal our true selves. Whoops, I guess I just proved those rumors about her secret to be true, too. Damn, sorry Michelle!”
Representatives for the Obama children, Malia and Sasha, could not be reached for comment, but their Facebook pages both were vacant of any comments on the split.

8,"Jeffrey Epstein Spotted Alive and Well in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico",https://empirenews.net/jeffrey-epstein-spotted-alive-and-well-in-puerto-vallarta-mexico/,"Jeffrey Epstein, the man once thought capable of bringing down multiple governments with insider information about his immense pedophila ring and sex island, was reportedly seen alive in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico early this morning. A tourist visiting the area from Atlanta said they recognized him immediately.
“I was kind of shook, it was like seeing a ghost,” said the tourist, who wished to remain anonymous. “His murder – er, I mean, his suicide – was pretty much the biggest story of 2019 before it got swept away by the media. I’ve seen the guy’s face so many times on the news and on social media in memes, there’s no way I was mistaken.”
Another reported sighting of Epstein came only 3 hours later, and police were notified.
“Honestly, you’d think after they faked his death, he’d go somewhere a little more remote than a resort in Mexico,” said Carl Richards, who is vacationing in the area while going through a bitter divorce. “I came down here to relax and stop thinking about my bitch ex-wife, but now I think it’s time to go. If Epstein is here, and this news is breaking out, it won’t be long before the place is overrun with paparazzi.”
A single photo was taken by the anonymous person who first viewed Epstein as he exited a Puerto Vallarta hotel.
“I wanted to get closer, but I didn’t want to spook him,” said the source. “The picture is horrible, but I ended up walking right past him. It’s definitely Epstein.”

9,BREAKING: President Trump Arrested Leaving Trump Tower in New York,https://empirenews.net/breaking-president-trump-arrested-leaving-trump-tower-in-new-york/,"Police Chief Mario Brann said that his officers were acting on an open warrant from 1998, when Trump allegedly struck a pedestrian while driving through the city, and left the scene. The pedestrian, whose name was not released, later died of their injuries.
“It is with great pleasure that I announce that we have taken President Donald Trump into custody for his role in the death of a young man in 1998,” said Chief Brann. “Mr. Trump is alleged to have killed the victim in a hit-and-run accident, for which he had never been charged. That changes today.”
Lawyers for President Trump say that the charges are “absolutely ridiculous” and “totally absurd.”
“There is no way that he was driving through the streets of New York and killed someone,” said Richard Moorehouse, a private attorney retained by the president. “President Trump cannot drive. The guy can barely navigate a golf course in a golf cart, you think he has ever learned to drive an actual car? He’s a total moron. Nobody would let him behind the wheel. If this accident occurred as they say, then we attest that Mr. Trump had a driver at the time, and he is not guilty of anything.”
“I’ve heard of people pleading insanity, but I’ve never heard of anyone pleading total idiocy to get out of a crime before,” said Chief Brann. “I am intrigued to see how this plays out. Either way, this gives everyone a break from Trump’s stupid goddamn tweets for a few hours.”

“My client is clearly the basis for the new Disney character affectionately known as Baby Yoda, and designers at Disney knew exactly what they were doing when they developed The Child’s final form,” said lawyer Chris Dante, who is representing Gizmo. “We are seeking damages for the extreme distress, loss of work, and emotional turmoil that Baby Yoda has caused my client. I am confident we have a strong case.”
Lawyers for Disney could not be reached for comment, but an anonymous employee who works on The Mandalorian said that there were draft notes that indicated Disney executives “very much” wanted to have a new character that “was 50% Yoda, 50% Gizmo, and 100% adorable.”
Gizmo first rose to fame in 1984 with his starring role in the Christmas-themed horror film Gremilins.

11,Michelle Obama Officially Announces Her Candidacy for President,https://empirenews.net/michelle-obama-officially-announces-her-candidacy-for-president/,"Michelle Obama, the wife of former president Barack Obama, has announced that she will be running for president in the 2020 election.
“I know I’m a lot later than most people, but to be honest, there’s no reason to start running 2 years before the election,” said Michelle Obama from the family home in Philadelphia. “It’s much easier to wait until the ‘little people’ drop out, and we can see what’s left of the field. At this point, the field is pretty bland, so I’m going to come in and mow it down.”
Obama, who was highly involved in education and children’s health during her husband’s two terms, says that she plans to continue her advocacy for the young people of America.
“Kids are our future, and education and health are the most important things for the next generation,” said Obama. “I have no stance at all on foreign policy, taxes, abortion, religion, or literally anything else. My platform is the children, and between that and my name, I think I have a great shot of becoming the Democratic nominee, and our next president.”

12,BREAKING: War With Iran Imminent; President Trump Reinstates Military Draft,https://empirenews.net/breaking-war-with-iran-imminent-president-trump-reinstates-military-draft/,"Earlier this week, President Trump illegally ordered the assassination of a top military general in Iran, Qasem Soleimani, prompting Iran to promise a swift revenge. In the imminent face of war with a powerful military in Iran, President Trump reinstated the United States draft, last used during the Vietnam Conflict.
“There are a lot of incredible, selfless American men and women who have been serving in the armed forces, some for many years, some still in basic training,” stated President Trump early this morning from the Oval Office. “These people, they need help. They need a lot of really, really big help, and we need to make sure they receive it. Reinstating the United States draft process is the easiest, and most logical answer.”
The draft process, which chooses young, American men at random to enlist in the armed forces, is something most people thought they would never see used again, but military officials agree with Trump that it’s the most efficient way to quickly build our military forces in the face of danger.
“When you anger another country by committing a blatant and completely illegal war crime, such as the case with our President’s attack in Iran, things heat up quickly, and action must be taken,” said Secretary of Defense Mark Esper. “We are ready to have our young men suit up and join our military forces, and the reinstatement of the draft will help immensely.”
“It’s about time these lazy millennials do something with their life other than eat Tide pods and watch YouTube videos,” said MAGA-hat wearing, Trump voter Carl Richards, 42, from Atlanta. “They could use the direction, the discipline, and should want to fight to protect our country from foreign invasion. It’s what I would have done when I was their age. Not doing it now, of course. Got myself some really tender soles, and I can’t walk for too long before my feet really start to hurt. If it wasn’t for that, I’d be out there signing up to shoot me some towelheads or whoever it is this time.”

Yes, you can get birds or other animals as pets, but birds are bullshit, and you damn well know it. So the choice is clearly dog or cat.”
Dr. Furball says that although many people own dogs because they think they’re a better animal, the real answer has always been cat.
“You cannot possibly think a dog is better than a cat after you see our research,” said Dr. Fluffy McCaterstein. “Dogs need to be walked. You have to take them out every few hours on their own. You can’t leave them home for more than a day by themselves or they’ll eat the couch. Frankly, dogs are stupid. Cats on the other hand, are now scientifically proven to be better pets.”
The research conducted by the team is currently “classified,” but notes will be available in the journal’s release.

14,Woman Gets Pregnant After Sleeping at Hotel With Dirty Sheets,https://empirenews.net/woman-gets-pregnant-after-sleeping-at-hotel-with-dirty-sheets/,"Penny Simon, 28, travelled to Boston for a sales convention, and said that the Hilton she stayed at was “super dirty,” and even though she complained, she thinks they didn’t change the sheets on her bed, and that semen left in the bed from a previous visitor got her pregnant.
“It’s crazy, really, and I feel so bad for her,” said Chris Simon, 29, Penny’s husband. “She’s very conflicted. We’re not an abortion household, but at the same time, the baby isn’t mine, and she’s saying she doesn’t know what to do. I really don’t want to raise another man’s child, but we’ve been trying for 4 years to get pregnant, and she hasn’t been able to. I will raise this baby as my own if that’s what God wants. I just hope the hotel knows that we are suing them for mental anguish. This is disgusting!”
Empire News spoke to Mary Rogers, who works the front desk at the Hilton in Boston where Penny stayed.
“The rooms are very clean, and this hotel was only a week old at the time the guest you mentioned stayed,” said Rogers. “No one had ever been in that room before. Although I was on staff the two nights Ms. Simon stayed here, and watched her bring up at least 3 different men from the hotel bar over the course of 4 hours, so if I had to guess how she got pregnant, I think that answers it.”

Even though the sexual debauchery was happening right out in the open in the middle of the town’s park, police said the only ones arrested were the protestors.
“We cannot very well arrest those who showed up looking for a good time at Pride, because they certainly had it,” said Chief Lincoln. “I know I certainly did, and that’s all I really want to say about that. The protestors, who stupidly admitted to their crimes on Facebook, were apprehended less than 24 hours later. We are still trying to track the source of their large quantity of drugs.”

Frankly, edibles are the only reason I can sleep at night myself. It’s been a long battle with wasted trillions of dollars, and I want it to stop.”
The President went on to say that the influx of tax revenue at the state and federal levels would be astronomical.
“Colorado can buy whatever they want, because it’s huge out there,” said Trump. “They can pay for education, healthcare, new roads, whatever. They can do that because of weed taxes. This is going to make the American people rich. Now we will be able to start building that wall!”

I am too old for more Monday Night Wars.”
McMahon is referencing the fan’s term for the ratings battle between the WWE and the then Ted Turner owned WCW. During the mid-90s, the two companies went head to head on Monday evenings in prime time TV slots. When WWE eventually took control of the ratings, McMahon bought out WCW and folded the entire promotion.
“When McMahon approached me, I laughed at first,” said Tony Khan, a billionaire whose family has long ties in the world of sports. “But he came in with a price that was just outrageous, and I would have been a fool to say no. Yes, I’m worth upwards of 4 times what the WWE is worth, but I didn’t get that way by being a fool. I’m a wrestling fan, and I love what we’re doing, but WWE can take what we’re doing and amp it up globally overnight.”
On news of the purchase, AEW’s Executive Vice President, Cody Rhodes, simply said “Fuck. Not again.”

“This is a great deal for us, one of the biggest and best deals in our country’s history, and I can honestly say, it was, in fact, a great deal because I made it,” said President Trump. “I only make good deals, and this deal is by far one of the greatest deals ever made.”
Experts say that the cost of the border wall will be somewhere in the nature of $500 billion, and President Trump says that he is “more than fine” with that trade off in exchange for the state of Texas.
“As a great man once said, only steers and queers come from Texas, and I don’t care about either of those things at all,” said President Trump. “Except of course in regards to my great VP Mike Pence, but he’s not a Texan queer, just a regular one, so it’s okay.”

19,Young Boy In Critical Condition After Apple AirPods Explode In His Ears,https://empirenews.net/young-boy-in-critical-condition-after-apple-airpods-explode-in-his-ears/,"A young boy in Florida has being hospitalized after his brand new Apple AirPod earphones allegedly exploded in his ear.
Caleb Mitchell, 8, has been hospitalized with 2nd degree burns on his face and inside of his ears after his Airpods exploded. According to Mitchell’s parents, the young boy is lucky to be alive, but is not out of the woods yet.
“I can’t believe something like this could happen,” said Josiah Mitchell, a standup comedian and the boy’s father. “I didn’t think they could get hot or explode or anything like that. Yet hear we are. Get it? Hear? Because Caleb is pretty much deaf now. Oh shit, I crack myself up.”
Caleb supposedly always had his Airpods in his ear, other than the times where he was charging them. He would even sleep with them, and wear them even when not listening to music. “Airpod owners are obsessed” says Candice James, a therapist, “Airpod owners really think they’re hot shit because their headphones don’t have wires. Wow, you’re so cool. Fucking losers. I just feel bad for the boy here because his parents indoctrinated him into wanting these in the first place.”
As Caleb is recovering, technology experts warn Airpod owners to not use them so much.
“Just throw them out,”  said tech expert Lee Xiu, “You’ll be a better person, Airpod owners are annoying.”

“In an effort to stop our wonderful men of the cloth from molesting any more children, we have decided to allow them to marry and fornicate with women,” said Francis. “This will hopefully put an end, once and for all, to the bad behavior of some of our flock.”
Despite the announcement taking place earlier this morning, there has been no word on whether any priests have elected to look for a wife, or if they’re content with their current arrangement of molesting children for years, having the church pay hush money, and being moved to a new location after all the news is buried.

“My client thought that because the item was an ‘Apple,’ device, that it would be edible as apples generally are,” said Dewey Cheatum, Esq., the attorney representing the unnamed man who engaged in the lawsuit. “We believe we have a very strong case, as Apple does not now, nor have they ever said that their items could not be eaten.”
Apple’s public response to the lawsuit was to have Tim Cook shit directly onto the portfolio, before mailing it back to the office of Cheatum with a note that said “go fuck yourself.”

The man claimed that he thought that the battery might give him the “energy boost” he would need to get through the rest of his day at work.
Doctors were able to extract the battery without seriously invasive surgery, but warned that putting things into your anus can “cause serious, irreparable harm.”
“This man, Joe Kennedy, who asked not to be publicly named, is very lucky,” said Dr. Frank Grates, the surgeon who extracted the battery. “He certainly could have done a lot worse. Thankfully, in this case, he went larger, and it was easy to grab. Had he gone with an AAA battery or something, and we might still be digging around in his colon.”

26,Man Who Bought a Pair of Dentures on Shopping App WISH Can Suddenly Speak Chinese,https://empirenews.net/man-who-bought-a-pair-of-dentures-on-shopping-app-wish-can-suddenly-speak-chinese/,"A Boston man, Arnold Richardson, said he didn’t know what to do when his dentist told him that he was going to need a new set of custom dentures to replace the ones he’s had the last 10 years.
“I was really put out, I can’t afford that kind of thing on my salary,” said Richardson, 46, a carpenter in the South End of Boston. “I really felt lost.”
Richardson said that he scoped out the internet for the best deals, and was surprised to find a set of dentures on the shopping website/app called Wish, which sells items at highly discounted rates, occassionally knock-offs, but almost always shipped from China.
“I was hesitant, honestly, because you hear about toys and other items coming from China and they’ve been painted with old, lead-ridden paint or something like that, but really, it was all I could afford.”
After waiting 6-8 weeks for his dentures, Richardson said he was “very surprised” to find that they fit perfectly, and even more surprised that when he put them in his mouth, he automatically began speaking Chinese.
“这篇文章和我们所有的文章一样, 都是假的,” said Richardson. “如果你明白了, 那就太好了。与你认识的每个人分享!永远记住不要在网上上当废话”

Although doctors had told Atkins’ wife, Miranda, that they believed if he ever woke up that Richard would be a complete “vegetable,” Miranda decided not to pull the plug.
“I’m so glad I listened to my gut, I knew he’d wake up eventually,” said Miranda. “I am concerned about his choice to be put back under though.”
Doctors were flabbergasted that Atkins woke up last Tuesday morning, cracking jokes and asking for lunch.
“He is a marvel of the medical world, that’s for sure,” said Dr. Francis Joseph. “I’ve been treating Atkins as his doctor for the last 20 years of his 26 years in a comatose state, and I never expected this. He woke up, was fine, and didn’t seemed at all bothered he’d been in a coma for nearly 3 decades. In fact, he asked to be put back under for another year so he’d be eligible for his social security and retirement benefits.”
Doctors say that they initially declined to give in to Atkins’ request, but eventually were persuaded.
“I told them that I had memories of being sexually abused while in my coma by hospital staff,” said Atkins before they put him back under. “Don’t tell anyone that it was total crap, I don’t remember a thing. I just don’t want to work again. Work sucks.”

John Richards, 43, died after his 87th box, when he suffered both a massive stroke and a major heart attack simultaneously.
“I have no idea what made that fat shit think he could finish off all those boxes, or why he even tried,” said Marlene Richards, 40. “I’ve been married to John for 20 years, and on his ass about his weight pretty much this whole time. When he heard that the Boy Scouts were going to allow girls in, he told me he thought that the cookies would ‘go extinct,’ and he wanted to get all he could. Dumb bastard.”
Police say they had to hire a team of movers to get Richards’ body out of the home, as he “weighed close to that of a grand piano.”
“The thing that really pisses me off is that he cashed out his life insurance policy to buy the cookies,” said Marlene Richards. “What in the hell am I going to do now? Eat the rest of these cookies for the rest of my life? God, I hate that fat lard.”

Vallee says that they are currently looking into any sort of “otherworldly” phenomenon or atmospheric reason that no one was born or died yesterday, but so far, they’ve been drawing a blank.

The purpose of the deal, according to insiders, is to ensure the “continuation and expansion of commerce and entertainment in the United States.”
“If Netflix makes $100 million dollars in profit, just as an example, should they be forced to pay 85% of that in taxes?” said President Trump in a completely unprepared statement. “Of course not, they need money to continue growing their company, and growing their output of amazing shows. That’s what is important when ti comes to the growth of this country. That’s how we’re going to continue to Make America Great Again.”

“Momo,” which is a stupid internet hoax that has been blown way out of proportion by the media, has now lost its hoax status after all the students were found dead in their school’s basement.
The children, most of whom were 14 or 15, reportedly each bought sleeping pills and bleach, and drank the toxic mixture. Police say the crime scene is “the worst in the history of police work.”
Melanie Reeve, 16, said one of her best friends was one of the teens who killed themselves, but she says she has “no idea” why should would do it.
“Everyone knows the Momo thing is fucking fake, that’s old news and no one actually cares about it except the news and old parents,” said Reeve. “I have no idea why [name redacted] did this. I told her that Momo wasn’t real, and she was just like ‘I know,’ but then did it anyway.”
Police are cautioning parents not to let their kids go “anywhere near the internet” until the Momo craze blows over.

32,Planned Parenthood Announces They Will Stop Performing Abortions At All Clinics Nationwide,https://empirenews.net/planned-parenthood-announces-they-will-stop-performing-abortions-at-all-clinics-nationwide/,"In a press release from Planned Parenthood, the non-profit company announced today that they would be ceasing to perform any abortions at any of their clinics throughout the country. The reason, they say, is not because of increased pressure from religious groups or right-wing nutjobs, but because they just really are sick of it being their “sole focus” in the media.
“We do so many amazing things for women, and for families in genera,” said Planned Parenthood CEO Marge Brock. “All anyone ever talks about is ‘gee, do you know how many abortions the perform,’ and that sort of thing. Frankly, it’s taking away all the resources of our other services, and we don’t have time to bother.”
Brock says that they will continue to council women on where they can get safe, medically performed abortions should they ask, but they won’t do anything in their facilities.
“We think this change will be great, and allow us to let people know about all the good we do,” said Brock. “Maybe now all these assholes will stop standing outside our offices with badly written signs and hatred, and they can go back to the internet where trolls belong.”

Police were lead to the home of Raymond Garfield, 30, after an anonymous tip.
According to reports, Garfield may have been murdering young women for over 10 years. He had been raping them, and killing them in numerous way – but all of the women were picked up in a local swingers bar.
“Mr. Garfield was seen frequenting a local nightclub, Le Swing, many times over the last several years, and would always leave with a young lady,” said Police Captain Lou Albano. “The women, several of whom were regulars, were never seen again. An investigation into Mr. Garfield was conducted after an anonymous bar patron called us, concerned about the constant stream of missing women he had seen leave with Garfield over several months.”
Garfield, a former construction worker, was arrested without incident. He is currently being held with no bail, with a court date set for March 3rd. If convicted, he will likely face the death penalty.

34,California Passes Law to Completely Ban Cigarette Sales,https://empirenews.net/california-passes-law-to-completely-ban-cigarette-sales/,"Lawmakers in California have passed a new law through the House that will completely abolish the sale of cigarettes throughout the state, according to reports. The new regulation, which will cost the state billions in tax revenue, will supposedly save upwards of 2 million lives per year.
“We have known forever that smoking is stupid shit, so why are we still selling cigarettes? Why is this still a thing?” said Representative John Lyman – D, California. “There is absolutely no reason to smoke. None. It doesn’t have a single actual benefit. It’s not like smoking weed, which, let’s face it, is awesome. Banning the sale will save lives, and help children not pick up the habit.”
The law will not go into effect until January of 2020, but Lyman says he hopes that many stores stop selling before then.
“I doubt they will, but it really is something we’re hoping the public helps us with,” said Lyman. “I mean shit, this isn’t Alabama. We’re a lot more sophisticated here.”

35,President Trump Signs New Order To Remove Marijuana From Schedule-1 Drug List,https://empirenews.net/president-trump-signs-new-order-to-remove-marijuana-from-schedule-1-drug-list/,"President Trump signed a new order today, removing marijuana from the list of schedule-1 drugs, opening the floodgates for the drug to become legal on a federal level.
“I’ve always been against drinking, because alcoholism killed someone very close to me,” said President Trump. “But that said, I’ve always been a big fan of smoking the ganj. In fact, it was while I was baked out of my mind with a couple of friends that I first thought to run for President, and now – well, here I am.”
President Trump said that with the increased tax revenue from the sale of marijuana nationwide, he hopes to build the border wall.
“Honestly, legalizing on a federal level will bring in trillons of dollars for this country. It will boost the economy and the government will be flooded with new monies,” said Trump. “I will have my wall built by the end of the year.”

36,Want Your Baby To Have Beautiful Green Eyes? Eat Your Boogers During Pregnancy,https://empirenews.net/want-your-baby-to-have-beautiful-green-eyes-eat-your-boogers-during-pregnancy/,"It all started as a simple thread in a well-known Spanish forum called “forocoches,” where someone posted the following question: “If I eat snot, will my children have green eyes?”
The post went viral around the world generating discussion. That’s why researchers at Harvard University in Boston, Massachusetts decided to study the effect – expecting to find no correlation. Their findings turned out to be extremely surprising.
They concluded that swallowing snot increases 80% the chances of green eyes for the baby.
“Believe it or not, we already knew about some benefits of eating your own boogers,” said Dr. Sam Not, who headed up the research. “It actually has health benefits, including boosting your immune system. What we didn’t know was that it directly correlated to eye color in the fetus of a pregnant woman. Our findings were astounding.”
Unfortunately, the news broke quite quickly, and has since become viral on social media. With doctors advocating for snot eating, many mothers-to-be are asking the really tough questions, such as “does snot contain gluten?” and ”If I’m a vegan, can I eat my snot?”
“Sorry to say, that medical science has not quite caught up to those questions yet,” said Dr. Not.

37,Study: Showering Daily Decreases Penis Size,https://empirenews.net/study-showering-daily-decreases-penis-size/,"A study from a prestigious Japanese university proves that the size of the penis decreases proportionally according to the number of showers a man takes. The study, which was initialized by Dr. Eypee Frealy, found that in a sample size of over 1000 men of various ages, their penis size would decrease based on the number of showers they took.
Dr. Frealy explained that the phenomenon happens due to two separate factors – Washing causes friction that causes erosion at the area, and excessive hydration.
“In one instance, an excessively clean man had completely lost his penis up inside his body. He showered and washed 5 to 6 times each day for a year. His OCD completely caused his penis to disappear,” said Frealy. “It’s a rarity, but it happened.”

Nearly $2.5 billion dollars per person.
“We know that it’s really, really high, but frankly, there’s not much we can do about it,” said lead researcher, Mario  Jones, M.D. “The ingredients in the drug warrant the cost. We’re actually taking a loss on each injection by several hundred thousand dollars. I cannot speak to, exactly, what is in the drug, because of patent concerns, but let me tell you, it’s really a great deal if you can get your hands on it.”

“Frankly, I think it’s a sweet term of endearment from a wife to her husband,” said one anonymous staffer. “He really is taking it the wrong way. Now, of course, when she refers to his penis as the President’s ‘little Cheeto Puff,’ that might be crossing a line. But still – they’re married, you’re supposed to work these things out.”
President Trump said that he has been married enough times in his life, that “ditching one more won’t make much of a dent” in his life.

Wilson reportedly was luring children into his home with the prospect of watching an unreleased Pokemon movie, to which every child gleefully ran into the home. Inside, they were disappointed to find that it was just a VHS tape of old recorded episodes.

43,BREAKING: President Trump Gives Full Pardon to Bill Cosby,https://empirenews.net/breaking-president-trump-gives-full-pardon-to-bill-cosby/,"President Trump has reportedly offered comedian Bill Cosby a full pardon, after the fallen star was found guilty of sexual assault and sentenced to 3 to 10 years in prison. Cosby, who is a lifelong friend of President Trump, could have spent his final days in prison had Trump not stepped in.
“Bill is absolutely and without a doubt, innocent on all charges,” said President Trump. “I understand very well how our court system works. I probably understand better than anyone, but that doesn’t matter. What matters is that I have met with Bill, we have spoken at length about the accusations against him, and I don’t believe a word of them.”
Over 60 women came forward to say that Bill Cosby had assaulted them, with many being drugged and raped while unconscious.
“We all know women like to gab, and this is a perfect example of why I plan to lower the crimes associated with assault or rape,” said Trump. “It’s obvious in this case that Bill had consensual sex with a woman who later regretted it, and then accused him of rape. Afterwards, of course, dozens of other women knew they could also try and make a dime off the publicity, and accused him as well. It’s sickening – truly sick – how some people think.”
Cosby, 81, will be allowed to leave prison on Monday as soon as the pardon is signed.

“In this world that we live, many men are having their lives ruined by false allegations and exaggerated claims, and it’s time to put a stop to it,” said President Trump. “I myself have been wrongly accused of sexual assault, as have many of my close friends, and it’s sickening. It’s terrifying to live as a man right now, and know that at any time, some woman who you may not even know could come forward and say that you forcibly kissed her, or groped her, or that you offered her money to sit on your face, and it could ruin your life. It’s disgusting behavior on the part of these women.”
Trump went on to say that he felt that the transgressions of young men, if they happen at all, should be forgotten or pushed aside based on the work they’ve done and accomplished in the years since.
“I will not comment publicly on whether or not I believe Brett Kavanaugh assaulted anyone, even though we all clearly know that he didn’t,” said President Trump. “What I do know is that the accusations are destroying him and his family, and that’s not right. It’s for MeToo to go away quietly.”
President Trump said that he hopes to pass new laws that would decrease the criminal statute that would imprison people like Bill Cosby, who was sentenced to 3-10 years for sexual assault, and instead would allow men who are found guilty to pay a sort of fine, or restitution to the plaintiff.
“It  is my hope that my son can grow up in a world where no woman will ever accuse him of touching her inappropriately, whether he did or not,” said Trump. “I want to keep Making America Great Again, and at this point, this is my number one concern.”

“We decided to let them go ahead and change the name, as well as the logo,” said NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. “We understand their reasoning – after all, the team is made up of predominantly African-American players – and we cannot see any reason why this name change would cause any issues.
The new Black Panthers say that they will finish the season with their current attired and logos, and plan for a switch during the 2019 season.
“We are very happy with the decision to allow this,” said team owner Mario Lewis. “I mean, I’m not a black guy, but I think it’s a very powerful statement. I know tons of black people, some of my best friends are black. So this is my way of supporting them, and supporting this team. We really hope that this will bring the fans together, and show them that singular differences are always the most important.”

The attack occurred at 2 am yesterday after police officers responded to residents who were alarmed by an intruder on their property.

Constable Malcolm Rudd suffered from two cuts and a black eye as well as multiple concussions to the head after the kangaroo in heat attempted to mate with the officer’s head.
“He was humping and rubbing his penis all over my partner’s face in a brutal fashion. I had to tase the animal or else he would have killed him” Constable Pete Turnbull explained, visibly emotional.
It took several minutes before Constable Turnbull realized that his partner was in trouble as he was dealing with the residents who had called during the assault.
 “When he was lying unconscious on the ground, it was dark and I thought his head was covered in blood. Thankfully, it was mostly kangaroo sperm,” Constable Turnbull told reporters in relief.

“When Mr. Callaway was asked to leave by security, he became enraged, and tried to perform a tombstone piledriver on the bouncer, which unfortunately injured both of them,” said police chief Carl Carpenter. “We arrived on scene along with an ambulance, and Callaway was transported to a local hospital.”
Carpenter says that had Callaway left on his own accord, he’d have been allowed to go home, but because of the assault, he will be facing up to 2 years in prison if the bar presses charges.

49,Florida Millionaire Arrested After Authorities Discover Over 700 Bodies Buried In His Backyard,https://empirenews.net/florida-millionaire-arrested-after-authorities-discover-over-700-bodies-buried-in-his-backyard/,"Jerry Richards, 73, was arrested this week at his home in Naples, Florida after a neighbor spotted him very obviously burying a body behind his house. When police arrested Richards, he admitted to having over 700 bodies buried throughout his property. Police have currently exhumed 587 bodies in varying stages of decay.
“Mr. Jerry Richards is likely the most prolific serial killer in history,” said Police Captain Robert Thomas of the Naples Police Department. “Based on the remains we have found so far, Richards has been murdering and burying bodies in his yard for over 35 years.”
According to public records, Richards purchased his Naples home in 1982, when he was 38-years-old. Richards came into money after his father, Carl Richards, left him a large inheritance, which he invested in both stocks and real estate. Upon his arrest, Richards net worth was well over $35 million.
Although the District Attorney believes the case to be “open and shut,” Richards has not yet stood before a judge to determine bail. With Richards’ excessive means, it’s likely he will be denied bail and forced to sit in jail awaiting sentencing. If convicted, Richards will likely be given the death penalty.

50,MTV Announces Drastic Programming Change – They’re Going Back to Music Videos!,https://empirenews.net/mtv-announces-drastic-programming-change-theyre-going-back-to-music-videos/,"Viacom Networks, the parent company of MTV, VH1, Nickelodeon, and others, has announced a major programming change for one of their longest-running networks. MTV, which started in the early 80s as a station airing music videos and music-related programming such as interviews with musicians, stopped showing music videos well over a decade ago, and now focuses on reality programming.
“We have decided that nostalgia is the winner here,” said MTV Chairman Reed Morris. “The people have spoken – in fact, they’ve been speaking for years – and they want their MTV. So we have made the decision to remove all existing programming, and go back to our roots. We will begin showing music videos on our network beginning in August.”
It has been a long-running joke that MTV no longer showed any music videos, despite their name – “Music TV.” Many on the internet bashed the company for their change to reality shows, and have been begging for music videos ever since.
“The funny thing is, a channel dedicated to just music videos is completely irrelevant in this day and age,” said MTV superfan Ryan Rogers. “I mean, I miss the days of watching my favorite videos on TV, but even I think this is kind of dumb. I can just go to YouTube and look up whatever I want, any time I want. I don’t need MTV. But it’s still cool they’re willing to ruin their whole network just for the ‘fans’.”

51,Investor and TV Star Mark Cuban Files for Bankruptcy After Series of Bad ‘Shark Tank’ Deals,https://empirenews.net/investor-and-tv-star-mark-cuban-files-for-bankruptcy-after-series-of-bad-shark-tank-deals/,"Investor and former billionaire Mark Cuban has filed for bankruptcy, after he says he made a series of bad business deals on Shark Tank. 
“Over the last two seasons, I’ve invested in about a dozen different businesses, and every single one of them failed,” said Cuban. “It’s absolutely the worst run of luck in my life. I’ve usually been a whole lot better at figuring out how to stay rich. This crippled me.”
Cuban, who made his fortune by perfectly timing the sale of an internet company before the bubble burst, has been an investor on the show Shark Tank since it began nearly 10 years ago. He is the first Shark to lose their fortune investing in the companies presented.
“I feel kind of bad for him, but not like, super bad or anything,” said Barbara Corcoran, another Shark. “Mark was worth more than the rest of the sharks combined, and it’s actually kind of nice to see a fall like this. It will probably give him a bit of humility. I have no doubt he’ll climb his way back up, but for now, I’m smiling a bit.”

52,Man Dies After Being Bitten by Daddy Long Legs,https://empirenews.net/man-dies-after-being-bitten-by-daddy-long-legs/,"As most people know, the Daddy Long Legs spider is the most venomous spider on the planet, but their fans are generally not sharp or strong enough to break the skin of most animals, including people. Apparently, no one told Christopher Moore, 32, who was killed after being bitten by the spider on Wednesday.
Moore, who was renovating a new home, was bitten early Wednesday morning, and ended up being rushed to the hospital. Because doctors had never seen the symptoms of a DLL bite before, they had no idea what was causing Moore’s illness. He was pronounced dead only 20 minutes after sustaining the bite.
During testing, doctors were able to discover the cause; it has since been classified as the first fatality from Daddy Long Legs.
“Craziest damn thing I’ve ever seen,” said Dr. Charles Milstead, who treated Moore. “He had very soft skin, I guess. Damn spider bit right through him, and he died in minutes. I’m still flabbergasted.”

“While I can neither confirm nor deny that I was a part of the stolen user data, it happened on my watch as CEO, and that’s not right,” said Zuckerberg. “Effective immediately, I am stepping down as the CEO of Facebook.”
When asked what his next plans were, Zuck was initially shy about answering, but was eventually persuaded to admit that he had his ambitions set on running the country in place of Facebook.
“Realistically, I was already running the country anyway,” said Zuckerberg. “Do you know anyone who isn’t on Facebook? Exactly. When you run the biggest website in the world that billions log onto every day, you’re basically running things, if you understand what I mean.”
Zuckerberg has not officially announced his candidacy, but sources close to him say he is “absolutely” planning a run in 2020.

54,BREAKING: Donald Trump Secretly Hired Illegal Immigrants To Start Building Border Wall,https://empirenews.net/breaking-donald-trump-secretly-hired-illegal-immigrants-to-start-building-border-wall/,"Top secret documents leaked to the press by a White House staffer showed that President Trump ordered the hiring of over 2,000 illegal immigrants to begin working on his border wall between Texas and Mexico. The documents, released to the press only hours ago, also stated that he was prepared to offer each worker upwards of $40 an hour.
“This is a goddamn outrage,” said construction worker Chris Thomas. “I have been bidding for the border wall job for nearly a year, and it’s the goddamn illegals that get the job? Isn’t the whole point of the wall to keep these sand people out of the fucking country?”
Trump released a statement on Twitter, stating that “all suspicion of illegals being used for labor at the border are false.” He went on to say that “Fake News” had struck again.
“I would never hire undocumented workers,” tweeted Trump. “The Fake News Media has struck again, and you’re all buying it. We don’t have any staffers in the WH that would leak that news, even if it were true.”

He was 89. Only last week, he was the “victim” of a death hoax after he was reportedly hospitalized with advance-stage cancer. His family refuted the claims last week, but have now since stated that yeah, the guy is finally, and thankfully, dead.
The Jackson family made a public announcement about the death of the Patriach, stating that “We really aren’t affected by his death,” with at least one family member quoted as saying “good riddance.”
“Honestly, the guy was a royal prick, and everyone knew that,” said one of the Jackson clan, speaking anonymously so as not to “make waves” throughout the family. “Everyone has seen The Jacksons: An American Dream. God knows VH1 has been airing it for decades. He was a cold-blooded bastard who beat the kids regularly, especially Michael. Did he push everyone to become better performers? Maybe, sure. But not the expense of having a life, and of love.”
Joe Jackson will be remembered my some, and forgotten by most. His family says that in lieu of flowers, please send worn leather belts and broken tree branches in remembrance.

0,The Mattress Futures Index: Is the US really going to default on its debt?,https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/mattress-futures-index-us-default-debt,"Fox News congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has the latest from Capitol Hill on 'Cavuto: Coast to Coast.'
Sharp investors rely on several key indicators to help judge activity on Wall Street and the health of the economy. They may study the price to earnings ratio or study the dividend yield. Economists probe home sales or retail sales numbers for clues.
Is there a barometer to gauge whether the U.S. will collide with the debt ceiling in early June?
Not really. But perhaps the ""Mattress Futures Index"" would be a good place to start.
In other words, one could check out the Mattress Futures Index to see if people invested in lots of mattresses to determine the chances of a federal default. If people suspect there’s a good chance of a default, then they may stow their cash under a mattress rather than keep it in the bank. Thus, they’d stock up on mattresses. So, the Mattress Futures Index (MFI?) is higher. If the MFI is lower, just keep your money in a conventional savings account. 
THE SPEAKER'S LOBBY: NOT QUITE A PAY RAISE
We jest. 
Kind of. 
And for the record, the Mattress Futures Index is not a real thing.
But should people really get concerned about a potential default in early June?
There are two factors working against President Biden and Congress right now. 
Time is an enemy. Mr. Biden huddles with the top four bicameral Congressional leaders on Tuesday. But it would be a challenge to muscle through an agreement by the deadline – even if they forged an agreement at the White House conclave.

The other issue: the math. Why? Because it’s always about the math on Capitol Hill. Congress has dealt with debt ceiling deadlines before. But it’s rare to attempt to tackle the debt ceiling in a political environment this calcified with a divided Congress and ultra-slim vote margins in both bodies.
The last real crisis over the debt ceiling gripped Capitol Hill during the summer of 2011. ""Tea party"" House Republicans had just flipped the House in the 2010 midterms, capturing an astonishing 63 seats. The tea party’s goal was to slash spending. Many Republicans won because they campaigned so aggressively against former President Obama. Those GOP members abhorred Mr. Obama. In fact, many arch-conservatives in the House didn’t even want former House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, to negotiate with the former President. And Boehner had to keep his distance from President Obama, too – lest conservatives suspect the Speaker was too chummy with the President.
Things are different this time around. President Biden says he won’t negotiate on the debt ceiling. So all Republicans have done for weeks is rail against Mr. Biden for not negotiating with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.
Moreover, some Republicans are skeptical of a possible default in early June.
""I think they manipulate the dates. I don’t believe it’s June 1. I think it’s more like sometime in August,"" said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La. ""This June 1 date – I think that’s a political statement. Not a statement based on fact.""
The Treasury Department forecast months ago that the U.S. could rendezvous with the debt ceiling deadline sometime over the summer. But two things unfolded: federal receipts from the spring tax season are down. Secondly, the much-maligned Internal Revenue Service is now more efficient at processing returns. So, the Treasury can more quickly project the date when the nation could run out of cash.
Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said it was ""dangerous"" for his colleagues to doubt Yellen’s veracity on the debt limit.
""We should trust them. That’s their job,"" said Coons.
There are even national security concerns about the U.S. hitting the debt ceiling. 
Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Jack Reed, D-R.I., posed those very questions to Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines at a recent hearing. 
""It would create global uncertainty about the value of the U.S. dollar and U.S. institutions and leadership, leading to volatility in currency and financial markets and commodity markets that are prices in dollars,"" testified Haines. 
The thing to watch for in the next few weeks are signals from the markets. 
The markets haven’t publicly reacted in a negative way which would get those on Capitol Hill to take notice. But examine some factors behind the scenes. Look at something called ""credit default swaps."" This is a mechanism investors use to ""insure"" their bet on government bonds. The cost of that ""insurance"" is now pricey. That implies that confidence in Treasuries aren’t what they should be. 
SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE IN TENSE DEBT CEILING STANDOFF
U.S. treasuries are historically some of the most solid, low-risk investments on the planet. But if it’s suddenly costing more – a lot more – to insure your bet that you’ll get your money back from the U.S. government….

Also, the Treasury just auctioned one-month bills which will ripen in early June. The yield on those bills skyrocketed to the highest level in history. The reason? Investors wanted a higher on their bills since there’s a chance government could default. Any contortions in what investors call the ""Treasury yield curve"" are usually foreboding economic signs.
""We shouldn't wait until markets get scared, rating agencies downgrade us. All of these things will make our own economy worse and our fiscal situation overall worse,"" said Maya MacGuineas of the Committee for a Responsible Budget.
But at least one lawmaker isn’t too concerned about negative market reactions.
""Markets are very emotional,"" said Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D. ""They respond to every geopolitical sneeze and passing of gas that happens anywhere. And so I tend to not worry a lot about how the market responds because they always recover.""
Lawmakers are trying to find out what Treasury does if the government does default.
""I'd like to hear Janet Yellen tell us what the priorities would be. How would you prioritize spending if all you had for a day or week or month, or several months is the revenue that's coming in?"" said Cramer.
Here’s what is believed could happen:
Those of us in media often try to equate complex financial and economic situations to everyday ""bread and butter"" circumstances for average Americans. We talk about ""credits cards"" and ""loans,"" much the same way someone addresses finances at home. Some of those analogies are on the mark. Many are way off base.
But with the debt ceiling, the credit card parallels are accurate.
The Treasury is constantly bringing in money and shoving it out the door to cover various debts. Standard paychecks for government workers. Filling up various retirement funds for federal workers. Sending out Social Security checks. Paying contractors. 
But if the government rams into the debt ceiling, the Treasury no longer has that ""line"" of credit to foot its bills. So, Fox is told the government would likely do what most people do at home when they hit a borrowing limit on their credit card: they pay the interest which is due. It’s believed that the federal government would pay that interest on the debt first.
""It will prioritize interest and principal payments so that it's not strictly defaulting on securities, on Treasury securities, which would roil financial markets,"" said Wendy Edelberg, the former chief economist at the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and now a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution. ""Then there are millions of people who are owed federal benefits, such as Social Security payments. We are talking about millions of people potentially not getting paid on a timely basis. So that would certainly affect people's pocketbooks.""
Naturally Americans would argue that the Treasury should pay them first, rather than someone else cutting in line.
THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO MCCARTHY'S DEBT CEILING PLAN
""We have to pay our former debts,"" said Cramer. ""So the first thing I think that has to be taken care of is how do we deal with the interest on the debt? In other words, can we service our debt if we can't borrow any more?"" 
Some Republican lawmakers tinkered with the idea of passing a bill mandating the order that Treasury pays its bills if there’s a default. But Congress – so far – can’t even pass a bill to address the debt ceiling. So that’s problematic.

""We don't want Treasury picking and choosing which payments should be made on a timely basis and which shouldn't. We don't want Treasury choosing which agencies should get funded on some particular day, or which program beneficiaries should get their checks on some given day. That's up to Congress,"" said Edelberg.
Edelberg suggested that unions or groups of people could then take the federal government to court to challenge who was getting paid or receiving benefits – or why they weren’t
""The legality of all of this really is very uncertain,"" said Edelberg. ""My guess is that the legal challenges come right away.""
All of this could spark sharp stock market declines and jumping interest rates as access to credit grows tighter.
But, we don’t really know. Expectations will mount after Tuesday’s meeting with the President and top Congressional leaders.

Right now, only one thing is certain: uncertainty.
We can talk about credit default swaps and distorted bond yield curves. But one thing to watch soon could be the ""Mattress Futures Index."" And if Congress doesn’t react quickly, one could argue that mattress futures may be a good place to invest.",1
1,Musk says inactive Twitter accounts getting purged,https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/musk-says-inactive-twitter-accounts-getting-purged,"'Kennedy' panelists Robby Soave, Gary Hoffmann and Scott Levenson discuss Twitter's decision to add blue checks to the accounts of dead celebrities. 
Twitter will start taking down certain accounts due to inactivity.
Elon Musk, who has helmed Twitter since his takeover of the social media company in late October, said the purge will affect accounts ""that have had no activity at all for several years."" He announced the move Monday.
One user later asked whether ""a lot"" of Twitter handles were ""about to become available,"" a tweet to which Musk responded, ""Yes.""
TWITTER CO-FOUNDER JACK DORSEY SAYS ‘IT ALL WENT SOUTH’ FOR ELON MUSK AFTER BUYING THE SOCIAL MEDIA GIANT
In late July 2022, when Twitter released its final quarterly earnings report prior to Musk completing the acquisition, it reported having a total of about 237.8 million average monetizable daily active users. For the U.S., it was 41.5 million.

Twitter warned on a Help Center page about its ""inactive account policy"" that accounts ""may be permanently removed due to prolonged inactivity."" The company measures the use of log-ins and recommends users to do so at least once a month, the page said.
Due to the inactivity-related purge, people ""will probably see follower count drop,"" according to Musk. His tweet announced the move has since been racking up engagement, including more than 21,000 retweets and 187,000 likes.

2,Xcel's plans in Becker would create one of  largest solar plants in country,https://www.startribune.com/xcels-plans-in-becker-would-create-one-of-largest-solar-plants-in-country/600273233/,"Xcel Energy plans to build another major solar array in Becker, creating one of the largest solar power complexes in the country.
Xcel said Monday it will ask Minnesota utility regulators to add a 250-megawatt solar array to the 460-megawatt Sherco Solar project in Becker that is already approved. The plan is to complete the entire complex by the end of 2025.
""We are committed to moving the Sherco Solar project forward to deliver significant new clean energy to our customers and communities,"" said Chris Clark, Xcel's president for Minnesota, in a statement. ""These projects will be the lowest-cost solar on our Upper Midwest system and demonstrate our focus on clean energy without compromising affordability.""
Still, Xcel acknowledged in a regulatory filing late Friday that costs for new solar farms — and clean energy projects generally — have been soaring. In a recent bid for solar proposals, Xcel found only two projects that were cost-effective for its customers.
One is the Sherco addition, the other a 100-megawatt solar project in Polk County, Wis., being developed by National Grid Renewables. Xcel would buy power from National Grid under a long-term agreement. Xcel would own and build the two Sherco projects.
The Sherco addition and the Wisconsin project total 350 megawatts, well short of the 900 megawatts of solar that Xcel was seeking in a request for proposals made in October.
In some cases, ""bids were significantly above the price level we view as prudent,"" Xcel said in the regulatory filing. The disappointing outcome of the bid is ""emblematic of the broader marketplace.""
The 710 megawatts of total solar power capacity at Sherco — with the proposed expansion — would help replace electricity lost from the retirement later this year of a 680-megawatt coal-fired generator in Becker.
 Of course, solar — while clean — is variable power, while coal power can be dispatched on demand.
The three large coal generators at Xcel's Sherco power station in Becker, which are big carbon dioxide emitters, are all expected to close by 2030.
Solar currently provides about 3% of Minnesota's electricity, and the majority of that comes from smaller solar arrays that are 5 megawatts or below. The largest ""utility-scale"" solar project currently is Xcel's 100-megawatt array near North Branch.
But a buildout of large projects is on tap, and the biggest is Xcel's 460-megawatt Sherco project, which the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC) approved in September despite concerns about its price tag.
Originally slated to cost about $575 million, Xcel disclosed in October that due to inflationary pressures, the price is now expected to be $690 million. New tax subsidies created by a landmark 2022 federal clean energy law will help cover cost increases for the 3,500-acre project, Xcel has said.
Xcel didn't disclose the estimated cost of the new Sherco solar project, which will take up 1,750 acres, in a filing Friday with the PUC.
However, the company noted a ""constellation of factors"" that have been driving up prices for solar projects. Those include ""ongoing supply chain constraints, high labor costs, and rising interest rates that increase borrowing costs,"" the filing said.
The massive trove of tax credits created by President Joe Biden's 2022 clean energy legislation has helped cover some of those cost increases.
But at the same time, the legislation has ""further increased demand"" for clean energy projects, ""putting upward pressure on prices,"" Xcel said in the PUC filing.
Edison Energy's Q4 Renewables Market Report shows that median solar PPA (Power Purchase Agreement) prices in the U.S. overall were 48 percent higher in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to one year prior, Xcel noted in the filing.
Construction began on the first phase of the 460-megawatt Sherco solar project last month. That project will create 300 construction jobs, while the 250-megawatt addition — if approved by the PUC — would produce another 90 trades jobs, according to Xcel.
The Sherco addition would create an estimated $110 million in payments to landowners and local taxes, in addition to an estimated $240 million in local economic benefits from the first two solar projects, Xcel said.
The combined Sherco solar projects would generate enough electricity to power more than 150,000 homes each year on average.
The PUC has permitted five other solar farms — ranging from 60 to 200 megawatts — in the past couple of years, including in March the 200-megawatt Byron Solar project in Dodge County. Several more solar projects are pending before the commission.
All of those are also facing rising costs, and some of them — though not Sherco and Byron — are waiting in a long line for approval to connect to the regional electric grid.",1
3,Rochester man scammed out of $2.4K in phone scam,https://www.kttc.com/2023/05/08/rochester-man-scammed-out-24k/,"ROCHESTER, Minn. (KTTC) – A 25-year-old Rochester man was scammed out of more than $2,400 in a phone scam over the weekend.
According to Rochester Police Department, a hostess at a restaurant received a phone call in Spanish and asked the man, an employee, if he could translate the call for her. He agreed to translate the call and spoke to someone claiming to be from Federal Express International.
The person on the phone said they were attempting to deliver a surprise package for a manager at the restaurant, and asked the man to pay for the delivery fees.
The caller claimed the money would be reimbursed through an app called Remitly. The man downloaded the app and was asked to give a copy of his driver’s license. He then transferred his own money from an ATM to bitcoin.
Later, he got a notification from the app saying more than $2,400 had been taken out of his account. The scammers then tried to take another $500 from his account, but there was nothing left for them to take.
The man has not gotten his money back at this time.

Meghan Markle was spotted on a hike in Montecito Sunday after skipping out on King Charles' coronation weekend.
Markle, 41, was joined by friends Markus Anderson and Heather Dorak on the hike. Prince Harry and the couple's children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet, were not with them.
The ""Suits"" actress wore a black tank top paired with black leggings for the outing. Markle further accessorized with a hat, a bandana and sunglasses. Despite skipping the royal festivities, Markle honored the late Princess Diana by wearing her watch for the hike.
The Duchess of Sussex wears the Cartier watch nearly every day, according to Page Six. Markle also sported a diamond tennis bracelet, that's believed to have been gifted to Diana from Charles during their marriage. Two diamonds from the bracelet were used to create Markle's engagement ring.

5,Prince Harry's Spare Ghostwriter Speaks Out About Working on the Explosive Memoir,https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a43828307/prince-harry-spare-ghostwriter-jr-moehringer/,"The ghostwriter for Prince Harry's tell-all memoir, Spare, is clearing the record.
In a new essay published by the New Yorker, J. R. Moehringer—also the author of The Tender Bar—opened up about writing the book with the Duke of Sussex for two years. The essay illuminates his close relationship with the royal, from the fight that almost ended their professional relationship to what it was like to temporarily live with Harry and Duchess Meghan in their California home.
Moehringer recalls a late night Zoom session with Harry to go over the book's edits. The two reached an impasse over a specific section in the book, in which Harry is in the midst of a brutal military training that simulates the experience of being kidnapped and tortured by terrorists. He is beaten, starved, stripped, and—at one point—the pretend captors hurl insults at him, one of which is a ""vile dig"" at his late mother, Princess Diana.
Harry insisted that this part of the book end with a witty comeback he hurled back at the captor, but Moehringer disagreed.
In the end, Moehringer convinced the royal to exclude the witticism from the passage, arguing that it unnecessarily detracts from the story's narrative power. Harry relented, then cheekily joked to the writer afterwards, ""I really enjoy getting you worked up like that.""
Despite the occasional editorial disagreements with Harry, Moehringer wrote that his impression of the prince was generally a positive one.
""I just liked the dude. I called him dude right away; it made him chuckle,"" he said. ""I found his story, as he outlined it in broad strokes, relatable and infuriating. The way he’d been treated, by both strangers and intimates, was grotesque.""
The author added that the two bonded in their shared grief over their mothers; Moehringer's mom had recently died when he and Harry first met.
""I wondered if we’d have any chemistry. We did, and there was, I think, a surprising reason. Princess Diana had died twenty-three years before our first conversation, and my mother, Dorothy Moehringer, had just died, and our griefs felt equally fresh,"" he wrote.
He later added, ""In retrospect, though, I think I selfishly welcomed the idea of being able to speak with someone, an expert, about that never-ending feeling of wishing you could call your mom."" 
Moehringer stayed with Harry and Meghan at their Montecito home multiple times over the course of writing the book—once accompanied by his wife and children, and twice by himself.
He noted that ""Harry won the heart of my daughter, Gracie, with his vast Moana scholarship; his favorite scene, he told her, is when Heihei, the silly chicken, finds himself lost at sea.""
Moehringer stayed in the couple's guesthouse, ""where Meghan and Archie would visit me on their afternoon walks. Meghan, knowing I was missing my family, was forever bringing trays of food and sweets."" The Duchess of Sussex also gifted toys to Moehringer's children.
When someone leaked the news that Harry would be releasing a memoir and that Moehringer was ghostwriting it, the author and his family were quickly hounded by the press. He described the terrifying experience of paparazzi following him and his wife as they dropped their son off at preschool, and of the endless false headlines published about him that he felt powerless to correct. To express his frustration over the public scrutiny, Moehringer called up Harry.
Moehringer also reflected on Harry's true intention for publishing Spare.
""While I always emphasized storytelling and scenes, Harry couldn’t escape the wish that Spare might be a rebuttal to every lie ever published about him,"" he said. ""He knew, of course, that some people would be aghast at first. 'Why on earth would Harry talk about that?' But he had faith that they would soon see: because someone else already talked about it, and got it wrong.""
BAZAAR.com previously reported that the royal family felt ""rattled"" following the book's January release.
""There was a feeling that whatever Harry said in his book would just be news today, gone tomorrow,"" a palace insider told BAZAAR at the time. ""However, the level of detail given in the book about specific relationships with the media has put it all under the microscope now.""
A source additionally said that Prince William—who faces several damning allegations in Spare, including instigating a physical fight with Harry after a fight about Meghan—felt ""devastated.""
""He's not ignoring the things his brother has shared,"" the source shared. ""The dust needs to settle, but … this has been food for thought.""
Harry was recently in London for the coronation of his father, King Charles III. Meghan and the couple's two children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet, did not join him.

The king, the eldest son of Queen Elizabeth II, was crowned on May 6 at London's Westminster Abbey.
Prince Louis, the youngest son of Prince William and wife Kate Middleton, had his first official royal engagement Monday.
Prince Louis attended the Big Help Out alongside his siblings, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, as they volunteered with the Scouts. As Monday is a holiday in the United Kingdom, following King Charles' coronation, communities are encouraged to spend the day volunteering.
While Prince Louis, 5, has appeared alongside Prince William and Princess Kate at royal events, he has not attended any working events, according to People magazine.

The CEO of Scouts explained to People magazine that the group of volunteers was not told about the royal family's attendance until 30 minutes before the group was set to arrive.
""I don't think they had time to process it,"" Matt Hyde told the outlet. ""At the end of the day, what was lovely was just to see them all mucking in together and, as young people, experiencing being young people and realizing that young people themselves can make such a difference in their local community.""
""Ultimately, part of what you need to be as a young person, is have fun,"" he added. ""And it was lovely after a full-on weekend for all of them that they were able to have a bit of fun at the end of it.""
Prince Louis, Prince George and Princess Charlotte all attended King Charles' coronation on May 6. Prince George had a role in the ceremony as a Page of Honour.

Single. Thing. the royals said to each other when they were caught chatting on camera. And there’s been a lot of focus on Prince Harry in particular for reasons including but not limited to ~the royal feud~.
According to a lip reader Jeremy Freeman who spoke to The Sun, Prince Harry allegedly (emphasis on ALLEGEDLY) told Princess Eugenie’s husband, Jack Brooksbank, “I’m fed up with the way they treat me.”
Unclear whomst Harry was referring to, but the lip reader claims he also said, “It’s not an ideal situation,” to which Jack Brooksbank allegedly replied, “If I can make you feel any better, and even I can do it. It’s not the quiet life, is it?” 
Harry then shook his head and the lip reader claims he said, “They don't care.” At another point, Jack allegedly said, “I haven’t time for that, not if it’s over…,” while Harry added, “It’s an eventuality.”
Truly they could be discussing anything but it’s definitely all very 👀.
Meanwhile, lip readers were also on notice to analyze what was being discussed on the Buckingham Palace balcony, where King Charles and Queen Camilla spent some time worrying about their crowns (wow, relatable as ever). Apparently, Charles said, “I can’t see a thing with this crown. I can’t look up,"" while Queen Camilla replied, “I can’t see anything either, my crown will fall off.”

9,Ringo Starr sets concert date in Grand Rapids,https://www.woodtv.com/news/grand-rapids/ringo-starr-sets-concert-date-in-grand-rapids/,"GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (WOOD) — Ringo Starr is bringing yet another magical mystery tour to West Michigan. The former Beatle and his All-Starr Band will play a show at DeVos Performance Hall later this year.
Starr announced the show on his social media pages Monday morning. The concert will be held at 7:30 p.m. on Tuesday, Oct. 3.
Tickets go on sale to the general public at 10 a.m. Friday.
Starr last performed in Michigan last September at the Soaring Eagle Casino & Resort in Mount Pleasant. He was supposed to play at the Four Winds Casino in New Buffalo the following night but was forced to cancel after being diagnosed with COVID-19.
According to Concert Archives, Ringo hasn’t performed in Grand Rapids since Starr and His All-Starr Band performed at Van Andel Arena on Aug. 8, 2003.
Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band was first founded in 1989 and has cycled in different musicians. The former Beatles drummer leads the way, singing the main vocals and playing the drums and piano.
The current lineup includes Men at Work singer/guitarist Colin Hay, Average White Band guitarist Hamish Stuart, instrumentalist Edgar Winter, Toto guitarist Steve Lukather, horn player Warren Ham and drummer Gregg Bissonette.",1

And he was in such a rush that he didn’t even have time to change, wearing his three-piece Dior suit at Heathrow airport. Which, fair enough! He simply wanted to make it home in time for his son Prince Archie’s 4th birthday!
But apparently, Harry was invited to a fancy lunch with his family following the coronation, which he ended up skipping. According to a “well-placed source” who spoke to the Daily Mail, most members of the royal family “breathed a sigh of relief” that Harry didn’t join them for the gathering, but apparently the King was “genuinely quite disappointed that he didn’t stay.”
Charles ended up making a quick toast over lunch, and after raising a glass to his grandchildren Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis, he toasted “those that weren’t there” and wished Prince Archie a happy birthday “wherever he was”—which was “a very sweet moment.”
Meanwhile, the Daily Mail reports that Archie’s birthday party was a low-key affair at the Sussexes’ California home and that Meghan baked a lemon cake made with fruit from their garden. There’s a pretty big time difference between England and California, so here’s to hoping Prince Harry got home in time to celebrate Archie’s big day with his friends and family!

LOS ANGELES - You can add Hollywood actor Scott Baio to the growing list of celebrities saying goodbye to California. 
The ""Happy Days"" actor and longtime resident of Los Angeles tweeted he'd made the decision to leave the Golden State after more than four decades because it's ""not a safe place anymore.""
""After 45 years, I’m making my way to finally ‘exit stage right’ from California,"" he tweeted. The 62-year-old actor included a quote from a local report that read, ""The most recent survey conducted by the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority found approximately 69,000 people experiencing homelessness in L.A. County and 41,000 in the city in 2022.""
Later, he tweeted that homelessness ""brings down property value. Also no consequences for crime that is rampant, making things higher in price and it’s just not a safe place anymore.""
Baio, who is perhaps most famous for playing Chachi on ""Happy Days"" before starring in ""Charles in Charge,"" said fellow Californians wouldn't ""miss his ‘right wing' views.""

12,Be well: Keep your bones strong to prevent osteoporosis,https://www.foxnews.com/health/be-well-keep-bones-strong-prevent-osteoporosis,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
May is National Osteoporosis Awareness and Prevention Month. The very common condition of osteoporosis occurs when the body doesn’t create enough bone tissue to keep up with the amount that is absorbed by the body — resulting in weak, brittle bones.
The disease affects around 10 million Americans, with another 44 million at risk of developing it, according to the Bone Health & Osteoporosis Foundation (BHOF), headquartered near Washington, D.C.
Nearly 20% of women aged 50 and over have the disease, along with almost 5% of men aged 50 and over, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states.
The good news is that the condition is largely preventable.
OSTEOPOROTIC FRACTURES POSE SERIOUS HARM TO MEN, TOO: STUDY
People with osteoporosis are more susceptible to sudden and unexpected bone fractures, said Dr. Ardeshir Hashmi, chief of geriatrics for Cleveland Clinic.
Nearly 20% of women aged 50 and over have the disease, along with almost 5% of men aged 50 and over. (iStock)
Most people aren’t aware they have osteoporosis until they experience a fracture.
""Unfortunately, most people find out the hard way,"" Dr. Hashmi said in a statement provided by Cleveland Clinic. 
""They don’t think they’ve ever broken anything before and they say, ‘Well, the fall wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be. I didn’t think I would get these fractures,’ and yet there they are with a fracture.""
BE WELL: PREPARE A DINNER RICH IN VITAMIN D FOR GOOD HEALTH
""By definition, that fragility fracture means you have osteoporosis."" 
The key to minimizing bone loss is to start implementing healthy habits as early in life as possible, Hashmi said.
These include eating foods rich in calcium, protein and vitamin D; taking bone-strengthening supplements such as vitamin D; and exercising regularly.
Eating foods rich in calcium, protein and vitamin D; taking bone-strengthening supplements like vitamin D; and exercising regularly can reduce the risk. (iStock)
Some of the best foods for bone health are fish (salmon, mackerel, tuna and sardines), dairy products (low-fat and non-fat milk, cheese and yogurt), fruits, green leafy vegetables and foods fortified with calcium and vitamin D, per the BHOF.
Most people aren’t aware they have osteoporosis until they experience a fracture.
Certain foods and drinks can put you at greater risk of bone loss and should be consumed in moderation. 
These include salty foods, alcohol and caffeinated beverages. Smoking also increases the risk.
When it comes to exercise, Hashmi suggested a combination of aerobic training (cardio) and strength training (weights).
For those who are concerned, Hashmi said it’s important for people to talk to their physician about scheduling a bone density scan.  (iStock)
Even small amounts of exercise are beneficial — and it doesn’t have to happen at the gym. Try incorporating small bursts of movement into your daily routine, the doctor suggested.
Walking, climbing stairs, riding a bike, dancing or even gardening are all decent ways to increase physical activity and help keep bones strong.

""For some people, it’s even water-type exercising, like aquatic therapy or swimming,"" Hashmi said. ""The resistance comes from the counter-pressure of the water. So, if I was in the pool just walking around, that would give me some strength training and some aerobic exercise as well.""

For those who are concerned that they’re at risk of osteoporosis or may already have it, Hashmi said it’s important to talk to a physician about scheduling a bone density scan. 
For those who are diagnosed, medications can help strengthen bones and reduce the risk of fractures.

13,Health,http://www.mcall.com/2023/05/08/had-pink-eye-recently-theres-a-chance-it-could-have-been-from-new-covid-19-strain/,"For some pollen allergy sufferers, eye irritation at this time of year is nothing new — but with the newest strain of COVID-19 circulating, local doctors are suggesting that if you have pink eye and a fever, you should test for COVID.
The World Health Organization announced Friday that COVID is no longer a global emergency, but the pandemic itself isn’t over and COVID continues to evolve.
XBB.1.16, also known as Arcturus, is the newest subvariant of the omicron variant of COVID-19 spreading throughout the U.S. and much of the world. Like many COVID variants and subvariants that came before it, Arcturus is believed to be the most infectious strain of COVID yet.
“It does seem to be more transmissible than the last variant XBB.1.5,” said Dr. Timothy Friel, chair of Lehigh Valley Health Network’s department of medicine. “That’s very telling because we thought XBB.1.5 was perhaps one of the most transmissible viruses that we’ve ever encountered.”
Arcturus hasn’t become the dominant strain of COVID in the U.S. yet — that position is still held by omicron variant XBB.1.5 — but it’s making gains. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that Arcturus accounts for about 12% of all cases nationally. Friel said it may account for  15% of cases in Pennsylvania. Arcturus has been identified in at least 34 countries and in India it is the dominant strain already.
One of the oddest things about the Arcturus subvariant is that it appears to correlate with increased cases of conjunctivitis, the inflammation of the outer membrane of the eye better known as pink eye. Conjunctivitis is usually caused by bacterial infections, but some viruses, like coronavirus and adenovirus, an agent of the common cold, can cause it too.
Dr. Jeffrey Jahre, St. Luke’s University Health Network chief emeritus of infectious diseases, said the fact that Arcturus can cause pink eye is not in and of itself notable, as other strains of COVID have caused pink eye in about 3% of patients. But pink eye, especially in children and babies, seems to occur more frequently with Arcturus.
“It seems that there is a far greater percentage of individuals with absolute bona fide Arcturus who have conjunctivitis,” Jahre said. “Although absolute conclusive evidence requires a number of repeated observations, in this case, it does appear to be the case.”
He added that with other strains of COVID, it has been rare for pink eye to be the only presenting symptom of a COVID infection, but with Arcturus, this seems to be happening more frequently, though fever also tends to be present.
Friel said that even though pink eye seems to be more likely from an Arcturus infection, coughing and sore throat are still the most common symptoms. If you have any COVID-like symptoms, you should get tested, he said.
Pink eye symptoms include the whites of the eye turning red or pinkish as well as itchiness, gritty feeling, tears, sensitivity to light and discharge that forms a crust that can make it difficult to open the eye.
Jahre said at this time of year when pollen has filled the air, there is a high chance that most cases of pink eye that emerge will be allergy related, but differentiating between allergic conjunctivitis and viral conjunctivitis may be difficult and may require evaluation by an eye specialist.
“If a fever is present, it is more likely to be COVID,” Jahre said. “If another individual in the family has diagnosed COVID, then anyone else in the family experiencing conjunctivitis symptoms should assume that he or she may also have COVID and take appropriate health measures and precautions to avoid affecting others.”
While pink eye isn’t fun, it fortunately usually doesn’t require treatment from a doctor. But Jahre said if the conjunctivitis worsens over 24 hours, that would be a good indicator to see a physician or an eye specialist.
The good news about Arcturus is that it doesn’t seem any more likely to result in severe COVID-19 illness than any other recent variant, Jahre said. He also said it’s likely that this summer will follow the last couple, where COVID cases and hospitalizations dipped.
Though it’s impossible to know the actual number of COVID cases, due to testing and reporting limitations, other metrics indicate a downward trend since January. Last week the rate of new confirmed COVID hospitalizations was 4 per every 1 million people and there were 1,109 new COVID deaths from April 27 to May 3, down significantly from the peak of 4,109 that occurred Jan. 5-11.
Jahre said in the last few days there have been fewer than 10 COVID inpatients at all St. Luke’s hospitals combined. Since April 10, LVHN has had fewer than 10 COVID patients hospitalized at any given time among all campuses.
Jahre added that for those most at risk, such as those with compromised immune systems, certain health conditions and the elderly, vaccines are still effective at preventing the worst outcomes of a COVID infection.
Jahre said many people may feel like the pandemic is over, but it is still not clear what COVID will ultimately look like — whether it will become a recurring seasonal illness like flu or if it will disappear almost entirely.
“The real test is going to come in the fall when people start spending more time indoors, school starts again, and so on and so forth — that’s when we have seen resurgences,” Jahre said. “We have to be careful before we say this is an over-and-done. If we can get away with not seeing a major resurgence in the fall, particularly the late fall, then I think we can have a lot more security that maybe the worst of all this is truly over.”",1
14,AI tool gives doctors personalized Alzheimer’s treatment plans for dementia patients,https://www.foxnews.com/health/ai-tool-gives-doctors-personalized-alzheimers-treatment-plans-dementia-patients,"Vik Chandra, CEO of uMETHOD, talked with Fox News Digital about how his company’s AI tool, RestoreU, is helping physicians pinpoint better treatment plans for their dementia patients.
More than six million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s disease — and one in three seniors dies with the disease, according to statistics from the Alzheimer’s Association.
With so many different factors — genetics, lifestyle and environment — influencing a person’s risk of developing Alzheimer’s, many doctors are moving away from one-size-fits-all approaches and calling for more individualized treatments.
It’s a concept known as precision medicine. And it’s what inspired a company called uMETHOD to create RestoreU, a tool that uses artificial intelligence to help physicians create personalized care plans for patients with Alzheimer’s and other types of dementia.
IN ALZHEIMER’S STUDY, SLEEPING PILLS ARE SHOWN TO REDUCE SIGNS OF DISEASE IN THE BRAIN
""Dementia is what’s called a complex disease,"" CEO Vik Chandra, co-founder and CEO of uMETHOD Health in Cary, North Carolina, said in an interview with Fox News Digital. 
""That means there are multiple underlying causes that eventually lead a patient to develop dementia over time.""
Many of these 50+ causes can actually be treated with available medications and interventions, he said. But because doctors are only spending on average about eight minutes with each patient, they often don’t have enough time to broadly assess the patient and address the treatable causes.
More than six million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s and one in three seniors dies with the disease, according to the Alzheimer's Association. (iStock)
The RestoreU system acts as a sort of assistant to the doctor, Chandra said.
""Its job is not to help the doctor diagnose the patient, but to help the doctor assess the treatable causes and then put the patient on the correct treatment,"" he explained.
""It’s really about improving the care,"" he added. ""It's not about seeing how far along they might be or whether they have dementia — it's what to do to help that patient's cognitive health.""
""When we're dealing with human health, with the lives of people, making incorrect recommendations or making errors is simply not acceptable.""
The RestoreU AI tool is most effective for patients who are starting to notice mild cognitive impairment and are in the early stages of dementia, Chandra told Fox News Digital.
""The data shows us that about 10% of the population over 65 years old — or a little over six million people — have dementia, and another 20% or so have mild cognitive impairment,"" he said.
Through a partnership with Quest Diagnostics, uMETHOD has rolled out its AI service to physicians, who can order the service through the patient’s electronic health record.
Once the physician orders the service, it triggers the exchange of extensive information between the doctor's electronic health record systems and Quest Diagnostics, Chandra explained.
ALZHEIMER’S DIAGNOSES EXPECTED TO REACH NEARLY 13 MILLION BY 2050, SAYS NEW REPORT
""It provides the doctor with a wealth of information on the underlying causes of cognitive decline, whether it's medications, beta amyloid, thyroid, B12 or lifestyle issues like sleep,"" he said. 
Next, RestoreU provides a report to the doctor on how to treat the patient, including adding or changing medications. 
The doctor gets a full plan that he or she can use to ""decide on the direction of care for the individual patient,"" Chandra said. ""Everything is personalized to the needs of that particular patient.""
Historically, medical care has relied on general guidelines that can be hard to customize to the nuances of each patient, the doctor said. (iStock)
The patient’s privacy is protected throughout the entire process, he noted. 
""We run our infrastructure in a HIPAA-compliant way that maintains the security and integrity of the patient data,"" Chandra said.
Mark Dredze, associate professor of computer science at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, is a big proponent of the use of AI in treating dementia patients.
""Care of patients with cognitive decline is especially complex and requires integrating multiple sources of information into a single care plan,"" he told Fox News Digital. 
""AI has the potential to integrate diverse types of patient data into an actionable treatment plan.""
Historically, medical care has relied on general guidelines that can be hard to customize to the nuances of each patient, he explained. 
""AI has the potential to integrate diverse types of patient data into an actionable treatment plan.""
""The potential for artificial intelligence in medicine is enormous, as it can combine many different types of information into a personalized plan for each patient,"" Dredze added. 
At the same time, however, he emphasized the importance of understanding the biases and risks of these technologies so that they raise the level of care for all patients.
Dr. Ashish Sachdeva, an internal medicine physician in Peoria, Arizona, who has been using the RestoreU AI tool for his patients for the past five years, calls it a ""no-brainer"" for any primary care doctor.
""It sets a benchmark and a lifelong plan of care for healthy living,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""With insights from the report, physicians may identify potentially reversible causes of cognitive decline, such as medication side effects or hormonal imbalances, that mimic dementia.""
""AI has the potential to craft precise treatment recommendations, allowing doctors to personalize care for each patient,"" one expert told Fox News Digital. (iStock)
""The information may also help identify measures to potentially slow or, if possible, halt dementia disease progression,"" Sachdeva added. 
The tool gives the doctor a comprehensive plan with lab reports, social history, pharmacological history, psychological history and advice for lifestyle changes, including diet, sleep, exercise and stress management. 
""It’s everything a primary care doctor should be doing anyway, but it’s all laid out on a platter,"" Sachdeva said.
EARLY ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE COULD BE DIAGNOSED THROUGH EYE EXAMS, NEW STUDY SUGGESTS
A key advantage of cognitive AI tools is their ability to identify risk factors early, he said.
""If you want to make a kicka-- 90-year-old, the process should start at 50,"" Sachdeva told Fox News Digital. 
""This report helps you identify risk factors and consider lifestyle changes, pharmacological changes, supplementation and other actions that will help achieve that goal.""
Except for identical twins, no two humans are alike, Chandra said. That’s why he believes in the power of precision medicine, which entails targeting treatments to the specific needs of a particular patient.
Through a partnership with Quest Diagnostics, uMETHOD has rolled out its AI service to physicians, who can order the service through the patient’s electronic health record. (iStock)
""The underlying causes of what leads to a patient's chronic disease, such as cognitive decline, vary significantly from one patient to another,"" he said. 
Among the 10,000 patients whom the AI tool has served to date, 52% of them have a dozen or more causes of cognitive decline — and they vary from one person to another, Chandra said. 
ALZHEIMER’S DIAGNOSES EXPECTED TO REACH NEARLY 13 MILLION BY 2050, SAYS NEW REPORT
""The treatment and interventions should be very specific to that particular patient, addressing the real causes that exist in that individual,"" he said. ""There is no one-size-fits-all solution."" 
In addition to improving patient outcomes, Chandra believes that precision medicine also will significantly reduce the costs of care, as the patient won’t be put on expensive medications and treatments that ultimately don’t work for them.

But with that precision comes a certain responsibility, the doctor said. 
With hundreds of different AI algorithms, it’s important to understand how the systems are reaching their conclusions.
One of the key advantages of cognitive AI tools is their ability to identify risk factors early, one doctor said. (iStock)
""The classes of algorithms that uMETHOD applies are always of the nature that can justify why they came to a particular set of conclusions, why they made a particular set of treatment recommendations,"" he said. 
""When we're dealing with human health, with the lives of people, making incorrect recommendations or making errors is simply not acceptable.""

""We have been very, very careful in selecting the appropriate set of algorithms so that physicians can increasingly rely on our solutions to deliver the best care to those patients,"" he added.
In the future, Chandra said uMETHOD aims to roll out solutions that focus more on prevention, with the goal of pinpointing early signs before patients wind up in the dementia stage.

15,Survivors warn of dangers around Radon exposure,https://www.wkyt.com/2023/05/08/survivors-warn-dangers-around-radon-exposure/,"LEXINGTON, Ky. (WKYT) - This week marks Lung Cancer Action Week and survivors are warning of the dangers of Radon exposure.
The invisible gas is a leading cause of lung cancer, only second to smoking.
An estimated 20 percent of the lung cancer cases in the commonwealth are caused by Radon exposure and the only way to know for sure, is to test indoor air.
Lindi Campbell is a mom from Lexington, a lung cancer survivor and patient advocate after learning that her childhood exposure led to her diagnosis years later.
“Radon is this toxic gas that can be so dangerous to our bodies and we’re not paying attention to it,” she said. “You can’t see, smell or taste it, but there’s a lot of things we can’t see. COVID we couldn’t see but we feared what we knew, so why do we not fear the science and the statistics that are out there to back this up?”
According to the EPA, 21,000 people die in the U.S. each year from cancer-causing Radon gas. That’s two lives lost, every hour.
“Radon does have a large impact on lung cancer in our state,” said Kyle Hoylman, Protect Environmental CEO. “In fact, radon has been identified in elevated levels in all 120 of our counties. Radon is responsible for more than 1000 deaths each year in our state, and that carries a pretty big price tag with it. It’s estimated to be well over $400 million in direct and indirect medical cost.”
To empower people to be proactive and take action to reduce the risk of radon-induced lung cancer, Protect Environmental is providing no-cost professional radon testing to homeowners in Lexington.
A Breath of Hope White Ribbon walk and 5K is planned for October in Lexington.

17,"Iowa, Iowa State investigating athletes gambling",https://www.espn.ph/college-sports/story/_/id/37568592/gaming-commission-investigating-iowa-possible-ncaa-violation,"The University of Iowa announced Monday that 26 athletes across five sports (baseball, football, men's basketball, men's track and field, wrestling) and one full-time employee of the athletic department are suspected of wagering on sports in violation of NCAA rules.
In addition, Iowa State acknowledged that some 15 of its athletes across three sports (football, wrestling and track and field) also are suspected of violating gambling rules.
Iowa said it ""has received information about 111 individuals,"" although only 26 are current athletes. The school said the ""vast majority"" are students who are on staff, former athletes or those with no connection to the athletic department.
The announcements came days after Alabama fired baseball coach Brad Bohannon amid an investigation into suspicious betting activity on the Crimson Tide's game against LSU on April 28. Sportsbook surveillance video indicated that the person who placed the bets was communicating with Bohannon at the time, multiple sources with direct information about the investigation told ESPN. That investigation is ongoing.
Iowa said university leadership was notified May 2 of potential criminal conduct related to sports wagering that also suggested possible NCAA violations. Law enforcement last Wednesday provided the university with a list of individuals alleged to have participated in sports wagering.
In response, the university notified several athletes they would not be participating in upcoming competitions and alerted the NCAA to potential violations.
The state Board of Regents said in a statement that the wagering was conducted online at Iowa and Iowa State.
""We are closely monitoring the situation and have confidence that University administrators at each institution will take all necessary steps to ensure ongoing compliance,"" the regents said.
NCAA rules prohibit athletes, coaches and staff from betting on amateur, collegiate and professional sports in which the NCAA conducts a championship. For example, athletes cannot bet on NFL games even if state laws would legally allow them to do so if they weren't competing under NCAA rules.
The Iowa Gaming Commission confirmed earlier Monday that it was investigating Iowa athletics after the university announced Friday that it withheld athletes from competition because of a potential NCAA violation. Iowa's statement was released after an Iowa-Ohio State baseball game in response to questions about an unnamed student-athlete who was not in the lineup.
""There is an ongoing investigation into these matters and we are unable to comment further at this time,"" the Iowa Gaming Commission said in a statement. ""The Commission takes the integrity of gaming in the state seriously and is continuing to monitor the situation and will provide any additional information when able.""
Brian Ohorilko, the director of gaming for the commission, said there is no evidence of match fixing or suspicious wagering activity.
""There wasn't anything giving us pause or leading us to believe that any of these markets were compromised,"" he told the Action Network.
A spokesperson for the NCAA told ESPN in an email that, ""Due to confidentiality rules put in place by NCAA member schools, the NCAA does not comment on current, pending or potential investigations.""
Iowa is among the 33 states that has launched legal betting markets in the past five years, since a decision from the United States Supreme Court struck down the federal statute that had restricted regulated sports betting to primarily Nevada.

18,Joe Mazzulla: Should've called TO on Celtics' final possession,https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/37570895/joe-mazzulla-called-celtics-final-possession,"Boston Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla admitted Monday he should have called a timeout before the final possession of his team's 116-115 overtime loss to the Philadelphia 76ers in Game 4, walking back what he originally said about the decision following Sunday's game.
The Celtics inbounded the ball with 19 seconds remaining after a James Harden 3-pointer, but never got a shot attempt off before the final buzzer.
Mazzulla defended the strategy after the game Sunday, but on Monday he acknowledged a timeout could have given the Celtics an opportunity at multiple chances to win the game.
""At the end of overtime, hindsight is 20/20. I should have called [a timeout] to help us get a 2-for-1 or a couple more possessions,"" Mazzulla said during a conference call with reporters. ""So, obviously with 14 seconds left, down one, you want to get as many chances as you can. So we'll definitely learn from that.""
The Celtics were faced with the same scenario at the end of the fourth quarter. Harden tied the game on a floater with 16.1 seconds remaining in regulation, and the Celtics inbounded the ball without calling a timeout. Jayson Tatum's drive generated an open 3-pointer from Marcus Smart, who missed as the game went to overtime.
However, Mazzulla stood by his decision-making at the end of the fourth quarter.
""It's something we've talked about all year,"" he said Monday. ""We trust our guys to make the right play. [Not calling a timeout] prevents the other team from getting matchups off the floor. It prevents the other team from getting their defense organized.
""Hindsight is always 20/20, so it sounds good to say, 'Yes we should have done this,' but we've prepared all year as a team to be able to take advantage of those situations. More times than not it worked out for us. I thought the end of regulation it worked out. We got the last shot, which is what you want. You don't want them to get an opportunity too.""
Down one at the end of overtime, Tatum dribbled out the clock and did not begin driving toward the basket until there were about five seconds remaining on the game clock. He supported his coach's decision not to call a timeout at the end of the game but admitted that he should have started attacking the basket sooner.
Tatum recalled how he hit the game-winning layup in the final seconds of Game 1 of Boston's 2022 first-round series against the Brooklyn Nets because the Celtics inbounded the ball without calling a timeout, preventing the opposing defense from getting organized.
""We've been doing it all year, we feel confident in that,"" Celtics center Al Horford said after Game 4. ""The momentum was there. Jayson had the ball in his hands, making a great play and if [Marcus] Smart would've caught it half a second earlier, it would've been down. I'm not getting too hung up on that play.""
Mazzulla, a 34-year-old in his first season as head coach, has been giving his players freedom on the final possessions all season without stopping the game with a timeout. And while he stuck to the principles behind that decision-making, he acknowledged there were lessons he could learn from Boston's final possession in overtime.
""I think the two lessons that you learn from that is call [a timeout] right away, get a 2-for-1, get two shots, get a couple extra possessions,"" Mazzulla said. ""Or we have to have a clear understanding as a team that we have to go faster to get a shot. We've done both over the course of the season. We just didn't execute either one in that particular situation.""
The series is tied 2-2. Game 5 is Tuesday night in Boston.",1
19,Brewers reverse course on extending beer sales through 8th inning,https://www.espn.com.sg/mlb/story/_/id/37570074/brewers-reverse-course-extending-beer-sales-8th-inning,"MILWAUKEE -- The Milwaukee Brewers have changed their minds about extending beer sales beyond the seventh inning of home games.
The Brewers were among a handful of teams that extended beer sales through the eighth inning in response to the shorter games this season following the pitch clock's arrival. Starting with their game Monday night against the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Brewers are going back to their previous policy of shutting down beer sales after the seventh inning.
When the Brewers decided last month to continue beer sales through the eighth inning, they called it an experimental move.
The Brewers said Monday their decision to reverse course wasn't due to any issues with fan behavior. They simply discovered that sales of all concessions drop precipitously in the late innings. Therefore, keeping beer vendors open for another inning wasn't producing a significant increase in sales.
Other teams that had extended alcohol sales through the eighth inning included the Arizona Diamondbacks, Houston Astros, Minnesota Twins and Texas Rangers. The Baltimore Orioles already had been selling alcohol through the eighth inning or until 3½ hours after the first pitch, whichever came first.
When reports circulated about the trend, Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Matt Strahm criticized the decisions. Strahm said on the ""Baseball Isn't Boring"" podcast that teams should be moving the cutoff for beer sales up to the sixth inning, rather than stretching to the eighth or later, which would give fans less time to sober up and drive home.
The average game length through Sunday's action was 2 hours, 39 minutes, a 27-minute drop from last season. MLB hasn't completed a season with game lengths that short since 1984, when they also were a 2:39 average.",1
20,NFL,https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/37569455/chiefs-rb-isiah-pacheco-had-offseason-surgery-labrum-hand,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Running back Isiah Pacheco is recovering from surgeries for a torn labrum and a broken hand, coach Andy Reid said Monday as the Kansas City Chiefs wrapped up a three-day rookie camp.
""He's making progress,'' Reid said. ""We'll just see how he does with it. I can't even give you a timeline on it, but he's doing well.''
The Chiefs begin offseason practice later in May. Training camp starts in July.
Pacheco as a rookie last season led the Chiefs in rushing with 830 yards. A seventh-round draft pick, Pacheco replaced Clyde Edwards-Helaire as the Chiefs' featured back early in the season.
Pacheco also rushed for 76 yards and a touchdown in the Chiefs' Super Bowl LVII victory over the Philadelphia Eagles.
The Chiefs did not sign a veteran back in free agency or select a player at the position in the draft. But they return their two other top backs from last season, Edwards-Helaire and Jerick McKinnon.
The Chiefs' first-round draft pick, defensive end Felix Anudike-Uzomah of Kansas State, did not participate in team drills at the rookie camp. He had surgery for a broken thumb before the draft.
""We're just kind of gradually bringing him back,'' Reid said on a timeline for his return. ""We'll just see how he feels.''
Reid also said recently signed veteran Donovan Smith would begin offseason practice as the starting left tackle. The Chiefs lost starter Orlando Brown in free agency to the Cincinnati Bengals.
The Chiefs' biggest addition in free agency, Jawaan Taylor, will play right tackle to begin, Reid said.",1

Indiana Pacers guard Bennedict Mathurin and Sacramento Kings forward Keegan Murray joined them on the All-Rookie First Team, with Detroit Pistons guard Jaden Ivey, teammate Jalen Duren, San Antonio Spurs forward Jeremy Sochan and Houston Rockets forwards Jabari Smith Jr. and Tari Eason comprising the All-Rookie Second Team.
Banchero, the No. 1 overall pick in last year's NBA draft, averaged 20 points, 6.9 rebounds and 3.7 assists this season. Williams, the No. 12 pick in last year's draft, averaged 14.1 points, 4.5 rebounds and 3.3 assists for the Thunder, while Kessler averaged 9.2 points, 8.4 rebounds and 2.3 blocks per game for Utah.
Mathurin, the sixth overall pick last June, averaged 16.7 points per game, while Murray averaged 12.2 points and shot 41% from 3-point range for the surprising Kings, helping them make the playoffs for the first time since 2006.
Ivey -- the only other player outside the five first-team selections to receive at least one vote for Rookie of the Year -- led the second team selections after averaging 16.3 points for the Pistons.

It will be the fourth sport from LSU to make a White House visit: The Tigers' football, baseball and track and field programs also have gone after winning national championships.
The UConn Huskies men's basketball team, which beat the San Diego State Aztecs 76-59 on April 3 in Houston to secure that program's fifth NCAA title, also will visit the White House on May 26. The UConn men previously went to the White House in 1999, 2004, 2011 and 2014.
The LSU women defeated the Iowa Hawkeyes 102-85 on April 2 to win the first NCAA title for their program. It is the fourth national championship for LSU's Kim Mulkey as a head coach; her previous three were with the Baylor Bears in 2005, 2012 and 2019. Her teams have visited the White House after every championship.
First lady Jill Biden attended the women's national championship game in Dallas and said the next day in an appearance in Denver that she might suggest to her husband, President Joe Biden, to invite both the Tigers and Hawkeyes after the final had a record-setting television audience. She soon issued an apology, saying there was no disrespect meant toward LSU.
There was never an invitation to Iowa.
Initially, LSU forward Angel Reese, the Most Outstanding Player at the women's Final Four, indicated she did not want to visit the Bidens because of the first lady's comment. But a few days later, on April 7, Reese told ""SportsCenter"" that she would go with the team.
President Biden spoke on the phone with both Mulkey and Reese, congratulating them on their 34-2 season.
""In the beginning, we were hurt. It was emotional because we know how hard we worked all year for everything,"" Reese said on ""SportsCenter."" ""You don't get that experience [to go to the White House] ever, and I know my team probably wants to go for sure and my coaches are supportive of that, so I'm going to do what's best for the team and we've decided we're going to go.
""I'm a team player. I'm going to do what's best for the team. I'm the captain.""",1

There’s a change atop the D1Baseball Top 25 rankings for the first time all season. Wake Forest ascends to No. 1 spot for the first time in the history of the rankings, which date back to 2015. The Demon Deacons have won all 12 of their weekends this year, keeping that streak alive with a hard-fought win against No. 19 Boston College. At 18-5 in the ACC, Wake leads the conference by four games.
LSU, which has been No. 1 since the preseason Top 25, relinquishes the top spot after losing a road series at Auburn. The Tigers slip just one spot to No. 2. Arkansas moves up three spots to No. 3 after sweeping a road series at Mississippi State to improve to 17-7 in the SEC, a half-game ahead of LSU in the Western Division. SEC East leader Vanderbilt holds steady at No. 5 after dropping a road series at Alabama; the Commodores nonetheless lead their division by two games over Florida and 2.5 games over South Carolina, both of which dropped road series this weekend. The Gamecocks fall from No. 3 to No. 6, and the Gators drop from No. 4 to No. 7.
Stanford jumps three spots to No. 4 after sweeping a huge road series at No. 20 Arizona State, improving the Cardinal to 18-6 in the Pac-12 — 3.5 games ahead of the second-place Sun Devils.
Teams 8 through 15 all hold their ground in the rankings, but Clemson leaps into the Top 25 for the first time this year at No. 16, on the heels of a series sweep of Louisville. After starting ACC play 2-8, Clemson has won five straight series to improve to 14-10 in the league.
Kentucky vaults back into the rankings at No. 17 after sweeping South Carolina, stopping UK’s four-series losing streak. The Wildcats are now 14-10 in the SEC.
Southern Miss also returns to the rankings at No. 25 after running its winning streak to 10 games, the longest active streak in the nation. Arizona State, Cal State Fullerton and Northeastern drop out of the rankings after losing their weekends.

The residence -- in the exclusive Madrid suburb of La Moraleja -- was empty at the time, sources said, as Rodrygo's parents were attending the match in Seville.
Police attended and collected evidence, after being alerted by an employee of the company responsible for the house's security.
Officers found several of the residence's rooms in disorder, and it has not yet been established what was taken, sources said.
The robbery was first reported by the newspaper 20 minutos and the EFE news agency.
Rodrygo, 22, put Madrid ahead in the second minute at the La Cartuja stadium, and then restored their lead on 70 minutes after Lucas Torro had equalised for Osasuna. He was picked as the final's MVP by Spain coach Luis de la Fuente and his staff.
A number of footballers' houses have been targeted in both Madrid and Barcelona in recent years, often while the players are away taking part in games.
Karim Benzema's house was robbed in January 2022 -- having previously been the victim of a robbery in February 2019 -- while the former Real Madrid midfielder Casemiro, now of Manchester United, and Isco and winger Lucas Vazquez have all suffered break-ins.

28,The Mattress Futures Index: Is the US really going to default on its debt? | Fox Business,https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/mattress-futures-index-us-default-debt,"Fox News congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has the latest from Capitol Hill on 'Cavuto: Coast to Coast.'
Sharp investors rely on several key indicators to help judge activity on Wall Street and the health of the economy. They may study the price to earnings ratio or study the dividend yield. Economists probe home sales or retail sales numbers for clues.
Is there a barometer to gauge whether the U.S. will collide with the debt ceiling in early June?
Not really. But perhaps the ""Mattress Futures Index"" would be a good place to start.
In other words, one could check out the Mattress Futures Index to see if people invested in lots of mattresses to determine the chances of a federal default. If people suspect there’s a good chance of a default, then they may stow their cash under a mattress rather than keep it in the bank. Thus, they’d stock up on mattresses. So, the Mattress Futures Index (MFI?) is higher. If the MFI is lower, just keep your money in a conventional savings account. 
THE SPEAKER'S LOBBY: NOT QUITE A PAY RAISE
We jest. 
Kind of. 
And for the record, the Mattress Futures Index is not a real thing.
But should people really get concerned about a potential default in early June?
There are two factors working against President Biden and Congress right now. 
Time is an enemy. Mr. Biden huddles with the top four bicameral Congressional leaders on Tuesday. But it would be a challenge to muscle through an agreement by the deadline – even if they forged an agreement at the White House conclave.
President Biden on Friday called for tougher regulations against the executives of failed banks.  (Fox News / Fox News)
The other issue: the math. Why? Because it’s always about the math on Capitol Hill. Congress has dealt with debt ceiling deadlines before. But it’s rare to attempt to tackle the debt ceiling in a political environment this calcified with a divided Congress and ultra-slim vote margins in both bodies.
The last real crisis over the debt ceiling gripped Capitol Hill during the summer of 2011. ""Tea party"" House Republicans had just flipped the House in the 2010 midterms, capturing an astonishing 63 seats. The tea party’s goal was to slash spending. Many Republicans won because they campaigned so aggressively against former President Obama. Those GOP members abhorred Mr. Obama. In fact, many arch-conservatives in the House didn’t even want former House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, to negotiate with the former President. And Boehner had to keep his distance from President Obama, too – lest conservatives suspect the Speaker was too chummy with the President.
Things are different this time around. President Biden says he won’t negotiate on the debt ceiling. So all Republicans have done for weeks is rail against Mr. Biden for not negotiating with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.
Moreover, some Republicans are skeptical of a possible default in early June.
""I think they manipulate the dates. I don’t believe it’s June 1. I think it’s more like sometime in August,"" said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La. ""This June 1 date – I think that’s a political statement. Not a statement based on fact.""
The Treasury Department forecast months ago that the U.S. could rendezvous with the debt ceiling deadline sometime over the summer. But two things unfolded: federal receipts from the spring tax season are down. Secondly, the much-maligned Internal Revenue Service is now more efficient at processing returns. So, the Treasury can more quickly project the date when the nation could run out of cash.
Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said it was ""dangerous"" for his colleagues to doubt Yellen’s veracity on the debt limit.
""We should trust them. That’s their job,"" said Coons.
There are even national security concerns about the U.S. hitting the debt ceiling. 
Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Jack Reed, D-R.I., posed those very questions to Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines at a recent hearing. 
""It would create global uncertainty about the value of the U.S. dollar and U.S. institutions and leadership, leading to volatility in currency and financial markets and commodity markets that are prices in dollars,"" testified Haines. 
The thing to watch for in the next few weeks are signals from the markets. 
The markets haven’t publicly reacted in a negative way which would get those on Capitol Hill to take notice. But examine some factors behind the scenes. Look at something called ""credit default swaps."" This is a mechanism investors use to ""insure"" their bet on government bonds. The cost of that ""insurance"" is now pricey. That implies that confidence in Treasuries aren’t what they should be. 
SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE IN TENSE DEBT CEILING STANDOFF
U.S. treasuries are historically some of the most solid, low-risk investments on the planet. But if it’s suddenly costing more – a lot more – to insure your bet that you’ll get your money back from the U.S. government….

Also, the Treasury just auctioned one-month bills which will ripen in early June. The yield on those bills skyrocketed to the highest level in history. The reason? Investors wanted a higher on their bills since there’s a chance government could default. Any contortions in what investors call the ""Treasury yield curve"" are usually foreboding economic signs.
""We shouldn't wait until markets get scared, rating agencies downgrade us. All of these things will make our own economy worse and our fiscal situation overall worse,"" said Maya MacGuineas of the Committee for a Responsible Budget.
But at least one lawmaker isn’t too concerned about negative market reactions.
""Markets are very emotional,"" said Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D. ""They respond to every geopolitical sneeze and passing of gas that happens anywhere. And so I tend to not worry a lot about how the market responds because they always recover.""
Lawmakers are trying to find out what Treasury does if the government does default.
""I'd like to hear Janet Yellen tell us what the priorities would be. How would you prioritize spending if all you had for a day or week or month, or several months is the revenue that's coming in?"" said Cramer.
Here’s what is believed could happen:
Those of us in media often try to equate complex financial and economic situations to everyday ""bread and butter"" circumstances for average Americans. We talk about ""credits cards"" and ""loans,"" much the same way someone addresses finances at home. Some of those analogies are on the mark. Many are way off base.
But with the debt ceiling, the credit card parallels are accurate.
The Treasury is constantly bringing in money and shoving it out the door to cover various debts. Standard paychecks for government workers. Filling up various retirement funds for federal workers. Sending out Social Security checks. Paying contractors. 
But if the government rams into the debt ceiling, the Treasury no longer has that ""line"" of credit to foot its bills. So, Fox is told the government would likely do what most people do at home when they hit a borrowing limit on their credit card: they pay the interest which is due. It’s believed that the federal government would pay that interest on the debt first.
""It will prioritize interest and principal payments so that it's not strictly defaulting on securities, on Treasury securities, which would roil financial markets,"" said Wendy Edelberg, the former chief economist at the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and now a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution. ""Then there are millions of people who are owed federal benefits, such as Social Security payments. We are talking about millions of people potentially not getting paid on a timely basis. So that would certainly affect people's pocketbooks.""
Naturally Americans would argue that the Treasury should pay them first, rather than someone else cutting in line.
THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO MCCARTHY'S DEBT CEILING PLAN
""We have to pay our former debts,"" said Cramer. ""So the first thing I think that has to be taken care of is how do we deal with the interest on the debt? In other words, can we service our debt if we can't borrow any more?"" 
Some Republican lawmakers tinkered with the idea of passing a bill mandating the order that Treasury pays its bills if there’s a default. But Congress – so far – can’t even pass a bill to address the debt ceiling. So that’s problematic.

""We don't want Treasury picking and choosing which payments should be made on a timely basis and which shouldn't. We don't want Treasury choosing which agencies should get funded on some particular day, or which program beneficiaries should get their checks on some given day. That's up to Congress,"" said Edelberg.
Edelberg suggested that unions or groups of people could then take the federal government to court to challenge who was getting paid or receiving benefits – or why they weren’t
""The legality of all of this really is very uncertain,"" said Edelberg. ""My guess is that the legal challenges come right away.""
All of this could spark sharp stock market declines and jumping interest rates as access to credit grows tighter.
But, we don’t really know. Expectations will mount after Tuesday’s meeting with the President and top Congressional leaders.

Right now, only one thing is certain: uncertainty.
We can talk about credit default swaps and distorted bond yield curves. But one thing to watch soon could be the ""Mattress Futures Index."" And if Congress doesn’t react quickly, one could argue that mattress futures may be a good place to invest.",1
29,Musk says inactive Twitter accounts getting purged | Fox Business,https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/musk-says-inactive-twitter-accounts-getting-purged,"'Kennedy' panelists Robby Soave, Gary Hoffmann and Scott Levenson discuss Twitter's decision to add blue checks to the accounts of dead celebrities. 
Twitter will start taking down certain accounts due to inactivity.
Elon Musk, who has helmed Twitter since his takeover of the social media company in late October, said the purge will affect accounts ""that have had no activity at all for several years."" He announced the move Monday.
One user later asked whether ""a lot"" of Twitter handles were ""about to become available,"" a tweet to which Musk responded, ""Yes.""
TWITTER CO-FOUNDER JACK DORSEY SAYS ‘IT ALL WENT SOUTH’ FOR ELON MUSK AFTER BUYING THE SOCIAL MEDIA GIANT
In late July 2022, when Twitter released its final quarterly earnings report prior to Musk completing the acquisition, it reported having a total of about 237.8 million average monetizable daily active users. For the U.S., it was 41.5 million.

Twitter warned on a Help Center page about its ""inactive account policy"" that accounts ""may be permanently removed due to prolonged inactivity."" The company measures the use of log-ins and recommends users to do so at least once a month, the page said.
Due to the inactivity-related purge, people ""will probably see follower count drop,"" according to Musk. His tweet announced the move has since been racking up engagement, including more than 21,000 retweets and 187,000 likes.

32,Prince Harry snubbed by royal family as Meghan Markle hikes with friends | Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/prince-harry-snubbed-royal-family-meghan-markle-hikes-friends,"True Royalty TV co-founder Nick Bullen reveals why it's best for the British royal family that the Duchess of Sussex will stay behind in Montecito during King Charles' coronation with her son Prince Archie and daughter Princess Lilibet.
Meghan Markle was spotted on a hike in Montecito Sunday after skipping out on King Charles' coronation weekend.
Markle, 41, was joined by friends Markus Anderson and Heather Dorak on the hike. Prince Harry and the couple's children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet, were not with them.
The ""Suits"" actress wore a black tank top paired with black leggings for the outing. Markle further accessorized with a hat, a bandana and sunglasses. Despite skipping the royal festivities, Markle honored the late Princess Diana by wearing her watch for the hike.
The Duchess of Sussex wears the Cartier watch nearly every day, according to Page Six. Markle also sported a diamond tennis bracelet, that's believed to have been gifted to Diana from Charles during their marriage. Two diamonds from the bracelet were used to create Markle's engagement ring.

33,Prince Harry's Ghostwriter Talks What It Was Like Writing 'Spare',https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a43828307/prince-harry-spare-ghostwriter-jr-moehringer/,"The ghostwriter for Prince Harry's tell-all memoir, Spare, is clearing the record.
In a new essay published by the New Yorker, J. R. Moehringer—also the author of The Tender Bar—opened up about writing the book with the Duke of Sussex for two years. The essay illuminates his close relationship with the royal, from the fight that almost ended their professional relationship to what it was like to temporarily live with Harry and Duchess Meghan in their California home.
Moehringer recalls a late night Zoom session with Harry to go over the book's edits. The two reached an impasse over a specific section in the book, in which Harry is in the midst of a brutal military training that simulates the experience of being kidnapped and tortured by terrorists. He is beaten, starved, stripped, and—at one point—the pretend captors hurl insults at him, one of which is a ""vile dig"" at his late mother, Princess Diana.
Harry insisted that this part of the book end with a witty comeback he hurled back at the captor, but Moehringer disagreed.
In the end, Moehringer convinced the royal to exclude the witticism from the passage, arguing that it unnecessarily detracts from the story's narrative power. Harry relented, then cheekily joked to the writer afterwards, ""I really enjoy getting you worked up like that.""
Despite the occasional editorial disagreements with Harry, Moehringer wrote that his impression of the prince was generally a positive one.
""I just liked the dude. I called him dude right away; it made him chuckle,"" he said. ""I found his story, as he outlined it in broad strokes, relatable and infuriating. The way he’d been treated, by both strangers and intimates, was grotesque.""
The author added that the two bonded in their shared grief over their mothers; Moehringer's mom had recently died when he and Harry first met.
""I wondered if we’d have any chemistry. We did, and there was, I think, a surprising reason. Princess Diana had died twenty-three years before our first conversation, and my mother, Dorothy Moehringer, had just died, and our griefs felt equally fresh,"" he wrote.
He later added, ""In retrospect, though, I think I selfishly welcomed the idea of being able to speak with someone, an expert, about that never-ending feeling of wishing you could call your mom."" 
Moehringer stayed with Harry and Meghan at their Montecito home multiple times over the course of writing the book—once accompanied by his wife and children, and twice by himself.
He noted that ""Harry won the heart of my daughter, Gracie, with his vast Moana scholarship; his favorite scene, he told her, is when Heihei, the silly chicken, finds himself lost at sea.""
Moehringer stayed in the couple's guesthouse, ""where Meghan and Archie would visit me on their afternoon walks. Meghan, knowing I was missing my family, was forever bringing trays of food and sweets."" The Duchess of Sussex also gifted toys to Moehringer's children.
When someone leaked the news that Harry would be releasing a memoir and that Moehringer was ghostwriting it, the author and his family were quickly hounded by the press. He described the terrifying experience of paparazzi following him and his wife as they dropped their son off at preschool, and of the endless false headlines published about him that he felt powerless to correct. To express his frustration over the public scrutiny, Moehringer called up Harry.
Moehringer also reflected on Harry's true intention for publishing Spare.
""While I always emphasized storytelling and scenes, Harry couldn’t escape the wish that Spare might be a rebuttal to every lie ever published about him,"" he said. ""He knew, of course, that some people would be aghast at first. 'Why on earth would Harry talk about that?' But he had faith that they would soon see: because someone else already talked about it, and got it wrong.""
BAZAAR.com previously reported that the royal family felt ""rattled"" following the book's January release.
""There was a feeling that whatever Harry said in his book would just be news today, gone tomorrow,"" a palace insider told BAZAAR at the time. ""However, the level of detail given in the book about specific relationships with the media has put it all under the microscope now.""
A source additionally said that Prince William—who faces several damning allegations in Spare, including instigating a physical fight with Harry after a fight about Meghan—felt ""devastated.""
""He's not ignoring the things his brother has shared,"" the source shared. ""The dust needs to settle, but … this has been food for thought.""
Harry was recently in London for the coronation of his father, King Charles III. Meghan and the couple's two children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet, did not join him.

Single. Thing. the royals said to each other when they were caught chatting on camera. And there’s been a lot of focus on Prince Harry in particular for reasons including but not limited to ~the royal feud~.
According to a lip reader Jeremy Freeman who spoke to The Sun, Prince Harry allegedly (emphasis on ALLEGEDLY) told Princess Eugenie’s husband, Jack Brooksbank, “I’m fed up with the way they treat me.”
Unclear whomst Harry was referring to, but the lip reader claims he also said, “It’s not an ideal situation,” to which Jack Brooksbank allegedly replied, “If I can make you feel any better, and even I can do it. It’s not the quiet life, is it?” 
Harry then shook his head and the lip reader claims he said, “They don't care.” At another point, Jack allegedly said, “I haven’t time for that, not if it’s over…,” while Harry added, “It’s an eventuality.”
Truly they could be discussing anything but it’s definitely all very 👀.
Meanwhile, lip readers were also on notice to analyze what was being discussed on the Buckingham Palace balcony, where King Charles and Queen Camilla spent some time worrying about their crowns (wow, relatable as ever). Apparently, Charles said, “I can’t see a thing with this crown. I can’t look up,"" while Queen Camilla replied, “I can’t see anything either, my crown will fall off.”

(WOOD) — Ringo Starr is bringing yet another magical mystery tour to West Michigan. The former Beatle and his All-Starr Band will play a show at DeVos Performance Hall later this year.
Starr announced the show on his social media pages Monday morning. The concert will be held at 7:30 p.m. on Tuesday, Oct. 3.
Tickets go on sale to the general public at 10 a.m. Friday.
Starr last performed in Michigan last September at the Soaring Eagle Casino & Resort in Mount Pleasant. He was supposed to play at the Four Winds Casino in New Buffalo the following night but was forced to cancel after being diagnosed with COVID-19.
According to Concert Archives, Ringo hasn’t performed in Grand Rapids since Starr and His All-Starr Band performed at Van Andel Arena on Aug. 8, 2003.
Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band was first founded in 1989 and has cycled in different musicians. The former Beatles drummer leads the way, singing the main vocals and playing the drums and piano.
The current lineup includes Men at Work singer/guitarist Colin Hay, Average White Band guitarist Hamish Stuart, instrumentalist Edgar Winter, Toto guitarist Steve Lukather, horn player Warren Ham and drummer Gregg Bissonette.",1
38,Royal Reaction to Prince Harry Leaving the Coronation Early,https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a43823792/royal-reaction-prince-harry-coronation/,"So, Prince Harry ended up making a lightning-fast appearance at his dad King Charles’s coronation on Saturday, showing up at the event to watch a crown get placed atop his father’s head, only to dip out immediately after. And he was in such a rush that he didn’t even have time to change, wearing his three-piece Dior suit at Heathrow airport. Which, fair enough! He simply wanted to make it home in time for his son Prince Archie’s 4th birthday!
But apparently, Harry was invited to a fancy lunch with his family following the coronation, which he ended up skipping. According to a “well-placed source” who spoke to the Daily Mail, most members of the royal family “breathed a sigh of relief” that Harry didn’t join them for the gathering, but apparently the King was “genuinely quite disappointed that he didn’t stay.”
Charles ended up making a quick toast over lunch, and after raising a glass to his grandchildren Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis, he toasted “those that weren’t there” and wished Prince Archie a happy birthday “wherever he was”—which was “a very sweet moment.”
Meanwhile, the Daily Mail reports that Archie’s birthday party was a low-key affair at the Sussexes’ California home and that Meghan baked a lemon cake made with fruit from their garden. There’s a pretty big time difference between England and California, so here’s to hoping Prince Harry got home in time to celebrate Archie’s big day with his friends and family!

40,Be well: Keep your bones strong to prevent osteoporosis | Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/health/be-well-keep-bones-strong-prevent-osteoporosis,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
May is National Osteoporosis Awareness and Prevention Month. The very common condition of osteoporosis occurs when the body doesn’t create enough bone tissue to keep up with the amount that is absorbed by the body — resulting in weak, brittle bones.
The disease affects around 10 million Americans, with another 44 million at risk of developing it, according to the Bone Health & Osteoporosis Foundation (BHOF), headquartered near Washington, D.C.
Nearly 20% of women aged 50 and over have the disease, along with almost 5% of men aged 50 and over, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states.
The good news is that the condition is largely preventable.
OSTEOPOROTIC FRACTURES POSE SERIOUS HARM TO MEN, TOO: STUDY
People with osteoporosis are more susceptible to sudden and unexpected bone fractures, said Dr. Ardeshir Hashmi, chief of geriatrics for Cleveland Clinic.
Nearly 20% of women aged 50 and over have the disease, along with almost 5% of men aged 50 and over. (iStock)
Most people aren’t aware they have osteoporosis until they experience a fracture.
""Unfortunately, most people find out the hard way,"" Dr. Hashmi said in a statement provided by Cleveland Clinic. 
""They don’t think they’ve ever broken anything before and they say, ‘Well, the fall wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be. I didn’t think I would get these fractures,’ and yet there they are with a fracture.""
BE WELL: PREPARE A DINNER RICH IN VITAMIN D FOR GOOD HEALTH
""By definition, that fragility fracture means you have osteoporosis."" 
The key to minimizing bone loss is to start implementing healthy habits as early in life as possible, Hashmi said.
These include eating foods rich in calcium, protein and vitamin D; taking bone-strengthening supplements such as vitamin D; and exercising regularly.
Eating foods rich in calcium, protein and vitamin D; taking bone-strengthening supplements like vitamin D; and exercising regularly can reduce the risk. (iStock)
Some of the best foods for bone health are fish (salmon, mackerel, tuna and sardines), dairy products (low-fat and non-fat milk, cheese and yogurt), fruits, green leafy vegetables and foods fortified with calcium and vitamin D, per the BHOF.
Most people aren’t aware they have osteoporosis until they experience a fracture.
Certain foods and drinks can put you at greater risk of bone loss and should be consumed in moderation. 
These include salty foods, alcohol and caffeinated beverages. Smoking also increases the risk.
When it comes to exercise, Hashmi suggested a combination of aerobic training (cardio) and strength training (weights).
For those who are concerned, Hashmi said it’s important for people to talk to their physician about scheduling a bone density scan.  (iStock)
Even small amounts of exercise are beneficial — and it doesn’t have to happen at the gym. Try incorporating small bursts of movement into your daily routine, the doctor suggested.
Walking, climbing stairs, riding a bike, dancing or even gardening are all decent ways to increase physical activity and help keep bones strong.

""For some people, it’s even water-type exercising, like aquatic therapy or swimming,"" Hashmi said. ""The resistance comes from the counter-pressure of the water. So, if I was in the pool just walking around, that would give me some strength training and some aerobic exercise as well.""

For those who are concerned that they’re at risk of osteoporosis or may already have it, Hashmi said it’s important to talk to a physician about scheduling a bone density scan. 
For those who are diagnosed, medications can help strengthen bones and reduce the risk of fractures.

41,Had pink eye recently? There's a chance it could have been from new COVID-19 strain,http://www.mcall.com/2023/05/08/had-pink-eye-recently-theres-a-chance-it-could-have-been-from-new-covid-19-strain/,"For some pollen allergy sufferers, eye irritation at this time of year is nothing new — but with the newest strain of COVID-19 circulating, local doctors are suggesting that if you have pink eye and a fever, you should test for COVID.
The World Health Organization announced Friday that COVID is no longer a global emergency, but the pandemic itself isn’t over and COVID continues to evolve.
XBB.1.16, also known as Arcturus, is the newest subvariant of the omicron variant of COVID-19 spreading throughout the U.S. and much of the world. Like many COVID variants and subvariants that came before it, Arcturus is believed to be the most infectious strain of COVID yet.
“It does seem to be more transmissible than the last variant XBB.1.5,” said Dr. Timothy Friel, chair of Lehigh Valley Health Network’s department of medicine. “That’s very telling because we thought XBB.1.5 was perhaps one of the most transmissible viruses that we’ve ever encountered.”
Arcturus hasn’t become the dominant strain of COVID in the U.S. yet — that position is still held by omicron variant XBB.1.5 — but it’s making gains. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that Arcturus accounts for about 12% of all cases nationally. Friel said it may account for  15% of cases in Pennsylvania. Arcturus has been identified in at least 34 countries and in India it is the dominant strain already.
One of the oddest things about the Arcturus subvariant is that it appears to correlate with increased cases of conjunctivitis, the inflammation of the outer membrane of the eye better known as pink eye. Conjunctivitis is usually caused by bacterial infections, but some viruses, like coronavirus and adenovirus, an agent of the common cold, can cause it too.
Dr. Jeffrey Jahre, St. Luke’s University Health Network chief emeritus of infectious diseases, said the fact that Arcturus can cause pink eye is not in and of itself notable, as other strains of COVID have caused pink eye in about 3% of patients. But pink eye, especially in children and babies, seems to occur more frequently with Arcturus.
“It seems that there is a far greater percentage of individuals with absolute bona fide Arcturus who have conjunctivitis,” Jahre said. “Although absolute conclusive evidence requires a number of repeated observations, in this case, it does appear to be the case.”
He added that with other strains of COVID, it has been rare for pink eye to be the only presenting symptom of a COVID infection, but with Arcturus, this seems to be happening more frequently, though fever also tends to be present.
Friel said that even though pink eye seems to be more likely from an Arcturus infection, coughing and sore throat are still the most common symptoms. If you have any COVID-like symptoms, you should get tested, he said.
Pink eye symptoms include the whites of the eye turning red or pinkish as well as itchiness, gritty feeling, tears, sensitivity to light and discharge that forms a crust that can make it difficult to open the eye.
Jahre said at this time of year when pollen has filled the air, there is a high chance that most cases of pink eye that emerge will be allergy related, but differentiating between allergic conjunctivitis and viral conjunctivitis may be difficult and may require evaluation by an eye specialist.
“If a fever is present, it is more likely to be COVID,” Jahre said. “If another individual in the family has diagnosed COVID, then anyone else in the family experiencing conjunctivitis symptoms should assume that he or she may also have COVID and take appropriate health measures and precautions to avoid affecting others.”
While pink eye isn’t fun, it fortunately usually doesn’t require treatment from a doctor. But Jahre said if the conjunctivitis worsens over 24 hours, that would be a good indicator to see a physician or an eye specialist.
The good news about Arcturus is that it doesn’t seem any more likely to result in severe COVID-19 illness than any other recent variant, Jahre said. He also said it’s likely that this summer will follow the last couple, where COVID cases and hospitalizations dipped.
Though it’s impossible to know the actual number of COVID cases, due to testing and reporting limitations, other metrics indicate a downward trend since January. Last week the rate of new confirmed COVID hospitalizations was 4 per every 1 million people and there were 1,109 new COVID deaths from April 27 to May 3, down significantly from the peak of 4,109 that occurred Jan. 5-11.
Jahre said in the last few days there have been fewer than 10 COVID inpatients at all St. Luke’s hospitals combined. Since April 10, LVHN has had fewer than 10 COVID patients hospitalized at any given time among all campuses.
Jahre added that for those most at risk, such as those with compromised immune systems, certain health conditions and the elderly, vaccines are still effective at preventing the worst outcomes of a COVID infection.
Jahre said many people may feel like the pandemic is over, but it is still not clear what COVID will ultimately look like — whether it will become a recurring seasonal illness like flu or if it will disappear almost entirely.
“The real test is going to come in the fall when people start spending more time indoors, school starts again, and so on and so forth — that’s when we have seen resurgences,” Jahre said. “We have to be careful before we say this is an over-and-done. If we can get away with not seeing a major resurgence in the fall, particularly the late fall, then I think we can have a lot more security that maybe the worst of all this is truly over.”",1
42,AI tool gives doctors personalized Alzheimer’s treatment plans for dementia patients | Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/health/ai-tool-gives-doctors-personalized-alzheimers-treatment-plans-dementia-patients,"Vik Chandra, CEO of uMETHOD, talked with Fox News Digital about how his company’s AI tool, RestoreU, is helping physicians pinpoint better treatment plans for their dementia patients.
More than six million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s disease — and one in three seniors dies with the disease, according to statistics from the Alzheimer’s Association.
With so many different factors — genetics, lifestyle and environment — influencing a person’s risk of developing Alzheimer’s, many doctors are moving away from one-size-fits-all approaches and calling for more individualized treatments.
It’s a concept known as precision medicine. And it’s what inspired a company called uMETHOD to create RestoreU, a tool that uses artificial intelligence to help physicians create personalized care plans for patients with Alzheimer’s and other types of dementia.
IN ALZHEIMER’S STUDY, SLEEPING PILLS ARE SHOWN TO REDUCE SIGNS OF DISEASE IN THE BRAIN
""Dementia is what’s called a complex disease,"" CEO Vik Chandra, co-founder and CEO of uMETHOD Health in Cary, North Carolina, said in an interview with Fox News Digital. 
""That means there are multiple underlying causes that eventually lead a patient to develop dementia over time.""
Many of these 50+ causes can actually be treated with available medications and interventions, he said. But because doctors are only spending on average about eight minutes with each patient, they often don’t have enough time to broadly assess the patient and address the treatable causes.
More than six million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s and one in three seniors dies with the disease, according to the Alzheimer's Association. (iStock)
The RestoreU system acts as a sort of assistant to the doctor, Chandra said.
""Its job is not to help the doctor diagnose the patient, but to help the doctor assess the treatable causes and then put the patient on the correct treatment,"" he explained.
""It’s really about improving the care,"" he added. ""It's not about seeing how far along they might be or whether they have dementia — it's what to do to help that patient's cognitive health.""
""When we're dealing with human health, with the lives of people, making incorrect recommendations or making errors is simply not acceptable.""
The RestoreU AI tool is most effective for patients who are starting to notice mild cognitive impairment and are in the early stages of dementia, Chandra told Fox News Digital.
""The data shows us that about 10% of the population over 65 years old — or a little over six million people — have dementia, and another 20% or so have mild cognitive impairment,"" he said.
Through a partnership with Quest Diagnostics, uMETHOD has rolled out its AI service to physicians, who can order the service through the patient’s electronic health record.
Once the physician orders the service, it triggers the exchange of extensive information between the doctor's electronic health record systems and Quest Diagnostics, Chandra explained.
ALZHEIMER’S DIAGNOSES EXPECTED TO REACH NEARLY 13 MILLION BY 2050, SAYS NEW REPORT
""It provides the doctor with a wealth of information on the underlying causes of cognitive decline, whether it's medications, beta amyloid, thyroid, B12 or lifestyle issues like sleep,"" he said. 
Next, RestoreU provides a report to the doctor on how to treat the patient, including adding or changing medications. 
The doctor gets a full plan that he or she can use to ""decide on the direction of care for the individual patient,"" Chandra said. ""Everything is personalized to the needs of that particular patient.""
Historically, medical care has relied on general guidelines that can be hard to customize to the nuances of each patient, the doctor said. (iStock)
The patient’s privacy is protected throughout the entire process, he noted. 
""We run our infrastructure in a HIPAA-compliant way that maintains the security and integrity of the patient data,"" Chandra said.
Mark Dredze, associate professor of computer science at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, is a big proponent of the use of AI in treating dementia patients.
""Care of patients with cognitive decline is especially complex and requires integrating multiple sources of information into a single care plan,"" he told Fox News Digital. 
""AI has the potential to integrate diverse types of patient data into an actionable treatment plan.""
Historically, medical care has relied on general guidelines that can be hard to customize to the nuances of each patient, he explained. 
""AI has the potential to integrate diverse types of patient data into an actionable treatment plan.""
""The potential for artificial intelligence in medicine is enormous, as it can combine many different types of information into a personalized plan for each patient,"" Dredze added. 
At the same time, however, he emphasized the importance of understanding the biases and risks of these technologies so that they raise the level of care for all patients.
Dr. Ashish Sachdeva, an internal medicine physician in Peoria, Arizona, who has been using the RestoreU AI tool for his patients for the past five years, calls it a ""no-brainer"" for any primary care doctor.
""It sets a benchmark and a lifelong plan of care for healthy living,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""With insights from the report, physicians may identify potentially reversible causes of cognitive decline, such as medication side effects or hormonal imbalances, that mimic dementia.""
""AI has the potential to craft precise treatment recommendations, allowing doctors to personalize care for each patient,"" one expert told Fox News Digital. (iStock)
""The information may also help identify measures to potentially slow or, if possible, halt dementia disease progression,"" Sachdeva added. 
The tool gives the doctor a comprehensive plan with lab reports, social history, pharmacological history, psychological history and advice for lifestyle changes, including diet, sleep, exercise and stress management. 
""It’s everything a primary care doctor should be doing anyway, but it’s all laid out on a platter,"" Sachdeva said.
EARLY ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE COULD BE DIAGNOSED THROUGH EYE EXAMS, NEW STUDY SUGGESTS
A key advantage of cognitive AI tools is their ability to identify risk factors early, he said.
""If you want to make a kicka-- 90-year-old, the process should start at 50,"" Sachdeva told Fox News Digital. 
""This report helps you identify risk factors and consider lifestyle changes, pharmacological changes, supplementation and other actions that will help achieve that goal.""
Except for identical twins, no two humans are alike, Chandra said. That’s why he believes in the power of precision medicine, which entails targeting treatments to the specific needs of a particular patient.
Through a partnership with Quest Diagnostics, uMETHOD has rolled out its AI service to physicians, who can order the service through the patient’s electronic health record. (iStock)
""The underlying causes of what leads to a patient's chronic disease, such as cognitive decline, vary significantly from one patient to another,"" he said. 
Among the 10,000 patients whom the AI tool has served to date, 52% of them have a dozen or more causes of cognitive decline — and they vary from one person to another, Chandra said. 
ALZHEIMER’S DIAGNOSES EXPECTED TO REACH NEARLY 13 MILLION BY 2050, SAYS NEW REPORT
""The treatment and interventions should be very specific to that particular patient, addressing the real causes that exist in that individual,"" he said. ""There is no one-size-fits-all solution."" 
In addition to improving patient outcomes, Chandra believes that precision medicine also will significantly reduce the costs of care, as the patient won’t be put on expensive medications and treatments that ultimately don’t work for them.

But with that precision comes a certain responsibility, the doctor said. 
With hundreds of different AI algorithms, it’s important to understand how the systems are reaching their conclusions.
One of the key advantages of cognitive AI tools is their ability to identify risk factors early, one doctor said. (iStock)
""The classes of algorithms that uMETHOD applies are always of the nature that can justify why they came to a particular set of conclusions, why they made a particular set of treatment recommendations,"" he said. 
""When we're dealing with human health, with the lives of people, making incorrect recommendations or making errors is simply not acceptable.""

""We have been very, very careful in selecting the appropriate set of algorithms so that physicians can increasingly rely on our solutions to deliver the best care to those patients,"" he added.
In the future, Chandra said uMETHOD aims to roll out solutions that focus more on prevention, with the goal of pinpointing early signs before patients wind up in the dementia stage.

44,Study: Sons of women with PCOS up to twice as likely to develop obesity - The Washington Post,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/05/07/polycystic-ovary-syndrome-obesity/,Newly published research suggests that the sons of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are up to twice as likely to develop obesity as their peers.,1
45,"Iowa, Iowa State investigating athletes gambling - ESPN",https://www.espn.ph/college-sports/story/_/id/37568592/gaming-commission-investigating-iowa-possible-ncaa-violation,"The University of Iowa announced Monday that 26 athletes across five sports (baseball, football, men's basketball, men's track and field, wrestling) and one full-time employee of the athletic department are suspected of wagering on sports in violation of NCAA rules.
In addition, Iowa State acknowledged that some 15 of its athletes across three sports (football, wrestling and track and field) also are suspected of violating gambling rules.
Iowa said it ""has received information about 111 individuals,"" although only 26 are current athletes. The school said the ""vast majority"" are students who are on staff, former athletes or those with no connection to the athletic department.
The announcements came days after Alabama fired baseball coach Brad Bohannon amid an investigation into suspicious betting activity on the Crimson Tide's game against LSU on April 28. Sportsbook surveillance video indicated that the person who placed the bets was communicating with Bohannon at the time, multiple sources with direct information about the investigation told ESPN. That investigation is ongoing.
Iowa said university leadership was notified May 2 of potential criminal conduct related to sports wagering that also suggested possible NCAA violations. Law enforcement last Wednesday provided the university with a list of individuals alleged to have participated in sports wagering.
In response, the university notified several athletes they would not be participating in upcoming competitions and alerted the NCAA to potential violations.
The state Board of Regents said in a statement that the wagering was conducted online at Iowa and Iowa State.
""We are closely monitoring the situation and have confidence that University administrators at each institution will take all necessary steps to ensure ongoing compliance,"" the regents said.
NCAA rules prohibit athletes, coaches and staff from betting on amateur, collegiate and professional sports in which the NCAA conducts a championship. For example, athletes cannot bet on NFL games even if state laws would legally allow them to do so if they weren't competing under NCAA rules.
The Iowa Gaming Commission confirmed earlier Monday that it was investigating Iowa athletics after the university announced Friday that it withheld athletes from competition because of a potential NCAA violation. Iowa's statement was released after an Iowa-Ohio State baseball game in response to questions about an unnamed student-athlete who was not in the lineup.
""There is an ongoing investigation into these matters and we are unable to comment further at this time,"" the Iowa Gaming Commission said in a statement. ""The Commission takes the integrity of gaming in the state seriously and is continuing to monitor the situation and will provide any additional information when able.""
Brian Ohorilko, the director of gaming for the commission, said there is no evidence of match fixing or suspicious wagering activity.
""There wasn't anything giving us pause or leading us to believe that any of these markets were compromised,"" he told the Action Network.
A spokesperson for the NCAA told ESPN in an email that, ""Due to confidentiality rules put in place by NCAA member schools, the NCAA does not comment on current, pending or potential investigations.""
Iowa is among the 33 states that has launched legal betting markets in the past five years, since a decision from the United States Supreme Court struck down the federal statute that had restricted regulated sports betting to primarily Nevada.

46,Joe Mazzulla - Should've called TO on Celtics' final possession - ESPN,https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/37570895/joe-mazzulla-called-celtics-final-possession,"Boston Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla admitted Monday he should have called a timeout before the final possession of his team's 116-115 overtime loss to the Philadelphia 76ers in Game 4, walking back what he originally said about the decision following Sunday's game.
The Celtics inbounded the ball with 19 seconds remaining after a James Harden 3-pointer, but never got a shot attempt off before the final buzzer.
Mazzulla defended the strategy after the game Sunday, but on Monday he acknowledged a timeout could have given the Celtics an opportunity at multiple chances to win the game.
""At the end of overtime, hindsight is 20/20. I should have called [a timeout] to help us get a 2-for-1 or a couple more possessions,"" Mazzulla said during a conference call with reporters. ""So, obviously with 14 seconds left, down one, you want to get as many chances as you can. So we'll definitely learn from that.""
The Celtics were faced with the same scenario at the end of the fourth quarter. Harden tied the game on a floater with 16.1 seconds remaining in regulation, and the Celtics inbounded the ball without calling a timeout. Jayson Tatum's drive generated an open 3-pointer from Marcus Smart, who missed as the game went to overtime.
However, Mazzulla stood by his decision-making at the end of the fourth quarter.
""It's something we've talked about all year,"" he said Monday. ""We trust our guys to make the right play. [Not calling a timeout] prevents the other team from getting matchups off the floor. It prevents the other team from getting their defense organized.
""Hindsight is always 20/20, so it sounds good to say, 'Yes we should have done this,' but we've prepared all year as a team to be able to take advantage of those situations. More times than not it worked out for us. I thought the end of regulation it worked out. We got the last shot, which is what you want. You don't want them to get an opportunity too.""
Down one at the end of overtime, Tatum dribbled out the clock and did not begin driving toward the basket until there were about five seconds remaining on the game clock. He supported his coach's decision not to call a timeout at the end of the game but admitted that he should have started attacking the basket sooner.
Tatum recalled how he hit the game-winning layup in the final seconds of Game 1 of Boston's 2022 first-round series against the Brooklyn Nets because the Celtics inbounded the ball without calling a timeout, preventing the opposing defense from getting organized.
""We've been doing it all year, we feel confident in that,"" Celtics center Al Horford said after Game 4. ""The momentum was there. Jayson had the ball in his hands, making a great play and if [Marcus] Smart would've caught it half a second earlier, it would've been down. I'm not getting too hung up on that play.""
Mazzulla, a 34-year-old in his first season as head coach, has been giving his players freedom on the final possessions all season without stopping the game with a timeout. And while he stuck to the principles behind that decision-making, he acknowledged there were lessons he could learn from Boston's final possession in overtime.
""I think the two lessons that you learn from that is call [a timeout] right away, get a 2-for-1, get two shots, get a couple extra possessions,"" Mazzulla said. ""Or we have to have a clear understanding as a team that we have to go faster to get a shot. We've done both over the course of the season. We just didn't execute either one in that particular situation.""
The series is tied 2-2. Game 5 is Tuesday night in Boston.",1
47,Brewers reverse course on extending beer sales through 8th inning - ESPN,https://www.espn.com.sg/mlb/story/_/id/37570074/brewers-reverse-course-extending-beer-sales-8th-inning,"MILWAUKEE -- The Milwaukee Brewers have changed their minds about extending beer sales beyond the seventh inning of home games.
The Brewers were among a handful of teams that extended beer sales through the eighth inning in response to the shorter games this season following the pitch clock's arrival. Starting with their game Monday night against the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Brewers are going back to their previous policy of shutting down beer sales after the seventh inning.
When the Brewers decided last month to continue beer sales through the eighth inning, they called it an experimental move.
The Brewers said Monday their decision to reverse course wasn't due to any issues with fan behavior. They simply discovered that sales of all concessions drop precipitously in the late innings. Therefore, keeping beer vendors open for another inning wasn't producing a significant increase in sales.
Other teams that had extended alcohol sales through the eighth inning included the Arizona Diamondbacks, Houston Astros, Minnesota Twins and Texas Rangers. The Baltimore Orioles already had been selling alcohol through the eighth inning or until 3½ hours after the first pitch, whichever came first.
When reports circulated about the trend, Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Matt Strahm criticized the decisions. Strahm said on the ""Baseball Isn't Boring"" podcast that teams should be moving the cutoff for beer sales up to the sixth inning, rather than stretching to the eighth or later, which would give fans less time to sober up and drive home.
The average game length through Sunday's action was 2 hours, 39 minutes, a 27-minute drop from last season. MLB hasn't completed a season with game lengths that short since 1984, when they also were a 2:39 average.",1

""He's making progress,'' Reid said. ""We'll just see how he does with it. I can't even give you a timeline on it, but he's doing well.''
The Chiefs begin offseason practice later in May. Training camp starts in July.
Pacheco as a rookie last season led the Chiefs in rushing with 830 yards. A seventh-round draft pick, Pacheco replaced Clyde Edwards-Helaire as the Chiefs' featured back early in the season.
Pacheco also rushed for 76 yards and a touchdown in the Chiefs' Super Bowl LVII victory over the Philadelphia Eagles.
The Chiefs did not sign a veteran back in free agency or select a player at the position in the draft. But they return their two other top backs from last season, Edwards-Helaire and Jerick McKinnon.
The Chiefs' first-round draft pick, defensive end Felix Anudike-Uzomah of Kansas State, did not participate in team drills at the rookie camp. He had surgery for a broken thumb before the draft.
""We're just kind of gradually bringing him back,'' Reid said on a timeline for his return. ""We'll just see how he feels.''
Reid also said recently signed veteran Donovan Smith would begin offseason practice as the starting left tackle. The Chiefs lost starter Orlando Brown in free agency to the Cincinnati Bengals.
The Chiefs' biggest addition in free agency, Jawaan Taylor, will play right tackle to begin, Reid said.",1

Indiana Pacers guard Bennedict Mathurin and Sacramento Kings forward Keegan Murray joined them on the All-Rookie First Team, with Detroit Pistons guard Jaden Ivey, teammate Jalen Duren, San Antonio Spurs forward Jeremy Sochan and Houston Rockets forwards Jabari Smith Jr. and Tari Eason comprising the All-Rookie Second Team.
Banchero, the No. 1 overall pick in last year's NBA draft, averaged 20 points, 6.9 rebounds and 3.7 assists this season. Williams, the No. 12 pick in last year's draft, averaged 14.1 points, 4.5 rebounds and 3.3 assists for the Thunder, while Kessler averaged 9.2 points, 8.4 rebounds and 2.3 blocks per game for Utah.
Mathurin, the sixth overall pick last June, averaged 16.7 points per game, while Murray averaged 12.2 points and shot 41% from 3-point range for the surprising Kings, helping them make the playoffs for the first time since 2006.
Ivey -- the only other player outside the five first-team selections to receive at least one vote for Rookie of the Year -- led the second team selections after averaging 16.3 points for the Pistons.
Monday's announcement of the All-Rookie Teams will be followed by the All-Defensive Teams on Tuesday and the All-NBA teams Wednesday, before the league hands out the Twyman-Stokes Teammate of the Year award Thursday.",1

It will be the fourth sport from LSU to make a White House visit: The Tigers' football, baseball and track and field programs also have gone after winning national championships.
The UConn Huskies men's basketball team, which beat the San Diego State Aztecs 76-59 on April 3 in Houston to secure that program's fifth NCAA title, also will visit the White House on May 26. The UConn men previously went to the White House in 1999, 2004, 2011 and 2014.
The LSU women defeated the Iowa Hawkeyes 102-85 on April 2 to win the first NCAA title for their program. It is the fourth national championship for LSU's Kim Mulkey as a head coach; her previous three were with the Baylor Bears in 2005, 2012 and 2019. Her teams have visited the White House after every championship.
First lady Jill Biden attended the women's national championship game in Dallas and said the next day in an appearance in Denver that she might suggest to her husband, President Joe Biden, to invite both the Tigers and Hawkeyes after the final had a record-setting television audience. She soon issued an apology, saying there was no disrespect meant toward LSU.
There was never an invitation to Iowa.
Initially, LSU forward Angel Reese, the Most Outstanding Player at the women's Final Four, indicated she did not want to visit the Bidens because of the first lady's comment. But a few days later, on April 7, Reese told ""SportsCenter"" that she would go with the team.
President Biden spoke on the phone with both Mulkey and Reese, congratulating them on their 34-2 season.
""In the beginning, we were hurt. It was emotional because we know how hard we worked all year for everything,"" Reese said on ""SportsCenter."" ""You don't get that experience [to go to the White House] ever, and I know my team probably wants to go for sure and my coaches are supportive of that, so I'm going to do what's best for the team and we've decided we're going to go.

There’s a change atop the D1Baseball Top 25 rankings for the first time all season. Wake Forest ascends to No. 1 spot for the first time in the history of the rankings, which date back to 2015. The Demon Deacons have won all 12 of their weekends this year, keeping that streak alive with a hard-fought win against No. 19 Boston College. At 18-5 in the ACC, Wake leads the conference by four games.
LSU, which has been No. 1 since the preseason Top 25, relinquishes the top spot after losing a road series at Auburn. The Tigers slip just one spot to No. 2. Arkansas moves up three spots to No. 3 after sweeping a road series at Mississippi State to improve to 17-7 in the SEC, a half-game ahead of LSU in the Western Division. SEC East leader Vanderbilt holds steady at No. 5 after dropping a road series at Alabama; the Commodores nonetheless lead their division by two games over Florida and 2.5 games over South Carolina, both of which dropped road series this weekend. The Gamecocks fall from No. 3 to No. 6, and the Gators drop from No. 4 to No. 7.
Stanford jumps three spots to No. 4 after sweeping a huge road series at No. 20 Arizona State, improving the Cardinal to 18-6 in the Pac-12 — 3.5 games ahead of the second-place Sun Devils.
Teams 8 through 15 all hold their ground in the rankings, but Clemson leaps into the Top 25 for the first time this year at No. 16, on the heels of a series sweep of Louisville. After starting ACC play 2-8, Clemson has won five straight series to improve to 14-10 in the league.
Kentucky vaults back into the rankings at No. 17 after sweeping South Carolina, stopping UK’s four-series losing streak. The Wildcats are now 14-10 in the SEC.
Southern Miss also returns to the rankings at No. 25 after running its winning streak to 10 games, the longest active streak in the nation. Arizona State, Cal State Fullerton and Northeastern drop out of the rankings after losing their weekends.

The residence -- in the exclusive Madrid suburb of La Moraleja -- was empty at the time, sources said, as Rodrygo's parents were attending the match in Seville.
Police attended and collected evidence, after being alerted by an employee of the company responsible for the house's security.
Officers found several of the residence's rooms in disorder, and it has not yet been established what was taken, sources said.
The robbery was first reported by the newspaper 20 minutos and the EFE news agency.
Rodrygo, 22, put Madrid ahead in the second minute at the La Cartuja stadium, and then restored their lead on 70 minutes after Lucas Torro had equalised for Osasuna. He was picked as the final's MVP by Spain coach Luis de la Fuente and his staff.
A number of footballers' houses have been targeted in both Madrid and Barcelona in recent years, often while the players are away taking part in games.

Crypto exchange Bittrex has filed for bankruptcy in the U.S. state of Delaware on Monday, months after announcing it would wind down operations in the country and weeks after being sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
The exchange believes it has more than 100,000 creditors, with estimated liabilities and assets both within the $500 million to $1 billion range, according to a court filing shared by Randall Reese of Chapter 11 Dockets, a bankruptcy tracker.
Bittrex's U.S. branch has had a rough 2023 so far, laying off 80 people in February and announcing in March that it would end all operations by the end of April. These changes have not affected Bittrex Global, the non-U.S. crypto exchange.
Despite Bittrex's impending exit from the U.S., the SEC sued it in mid-April on allegations it operated a national securities exchange, broker and clearing agency. The SEC also sued former Bittrex CEO Bill Shihara and Bittrex Global. Bittrex Global CEO Oliver Linch said last month that the exchange intended to fight these charges in court, but a bankruptcy proceeding may make this more difficult.
Bittrex is the latest crypto entity to file for bankruptcy, joining fellow exchange FTX and a host of lenders like Celsius, Voyager and BlockFi.
In filings made at the Delaware Court, Evan Hengel, the company's Co-Chief Restructuring Officer of Bittrex, said that customers would get a ""100 percent like-kind cryptocurrency distribution"" under its liquidation plan, enabling them to access the Bittrex platform and withdraw their crypto.
The company ""faced an untenable regulatory and economic environment"" given ""the lack of regulatory clarity in the U.S. [which] created a substantial negative economic impact on the digital asset industry and resulted in overlapping regulatory burdens and soaring regulatory costs,"" Hengel said.
Richie Lai, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of the company, tweeted that the bankruptcy filing was the ""cleanest way to bury the baby,"" but that Bittrex ""still have 100% of all customer funds.""
UPDATE (May 9, 07:30 UTC): Adds comments from Evan Hengel, Richie Lai.

US senators sent a letter Monday to Tesla CEO Elon Musk, saying they were ""incredibly troubled"" by reports that Tesla uses arbitration clauses in consumer and employee contracts to evade public accountability for rampant workplace discrimination and shocking vehicle safety flaws.
""We are deeply concerned that the arbitration agreements you impose on your workers and consumers have kept these reportedly deplorable and discriminatory conditions and potential safety flaws from the public eye and limited regulatory authorities’ ability to protect Tesla customers and employees and hold Tesla publicly accountable,"" the lawmakers wrote.
Their letter starts by describing reports of allegedly racist and sexist worker conditions. Black Tesla employees, the senators say, are confronted by racial slurs ""as often as 50 to 100 times"" daily and are reportedly racially segregated by Tesla management to work only in ""the lowest-level and most physically demanding roles."" Black workers also reported facing retaliation, on top of allegedly ""being disproportionately disciplined and demoted."" Meanwhile, female Tesla employees are ""allegedly groped"" and reportedly have been fired after complaining about harassment.
""Tesla’s confidential arbitration agreements—which appear to be mandatory for workers—significantly limit the extent to which the details of discriminatory conditions at the company may come to light,"" the senators wrote. They claimed that because of the agreements, there is likely an ""untold number of other complaints that remain confidential.""
From there, the letter describes how Tesla's consumer arbitration agreements have built ""a black box around any concerns drivers may have on the safety of Tesla’s vehicles.""
Senators said that while the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has documented some of the safety issues with Tesla’s Full Self-Driving beta software that ""increase the vehicle’s crash risk,"" there has been no light ""shed on what private settlements Tesla may have made over the safety of its cars."" They also criticized Musk's prior claims that a ""comprehensive safety validation review and rigorous internal development process"" help ""make certain that our technologies are safe.""
""Let us be clear: your so-called safety review is a sham,"" the senators wrote.
Tesla did not immediately respond to Ars' request to comment.
Signatories of the letter include Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Edward Markey (D-Mass.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Jeffrey Merkley (D-Ore.), Richard Durbin (D-Ill.), and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio).
Senators have asked Musk to respond by June 8 to a series of questions. They essentially want Musk to fill the gaps in public knowledge and detail Tesla's history of independently arbitrating complaints outside the public eye. That means they want to know how many worker complaints of racial harassment, discrimination, retaliation, and sexual harassment Tesla has received in the past decade—and how much Tesla paid out and settled. They also asked for a complete breakdown of vehicle safety complaints that Tesla received since 2012. Perhaps most importantly, they ended by asking Tesla to commit to no longer ""including arbitration clauses in employee and consumer contracts"" or ""filing motions to compel arbitration for new claims against it in court.""
Until Musk responds, the senators warn that ""the public—including would-be buyers—have no visibility into what complaints may have already been made and what other potential safety issues with Tesla vehicles may exist.""

(Kitco News) - Investors  should be prepared to see higher volatility in the gold market as market  expectations contrast sharply with what the Federal Reserve has signaled  regarding the future path of interest rates.
However, one market analyst is  recommending investors ignore the noise and focus on the broader bullish trend  in the marketplace. In an interview with Kitco News, Thorsten Polleit, chief  economist at Degussa, said that investors should use any gold price weakness to  build a strategic long-term position.
""If you are a long-term investor  and looking to hold gold for the next five years, then this price is right,"" he  said. ""Looking past the noise, gold prices are going to be a lot higher five  years from now.
Polleit's comments come as the gold  market holds support above $2,000 an ounce after prices dropped sharply from  last week's near-record highs. June gold futures last traded at $2,029.20 an  ounce, up 0.20% on the day.
Although gold prices were unable to  hit new all-time highs, Polleit said that he still sees gold prices ending the  year around $2,200 an ounce. He added that investors just need to be a little  patient.
""I'm actually thinking about  raising my year-end target because of how gold is acting,"" he said.
Polleit said that he sees the  disparity between market expectations and comments from Federal Reserve Jerome  Powell creating some safe-haven demand for gold. He added he has never seen  this prolonged gap between what the market has priced in compared to central  bank comments.
""Markets are pricing in rate cuts  this year because there is a growing mistrust of the forecasting ability of  central bankers,"" he said. ""Even if the Fed doesn't cut rates as soon as  markets expect, there is still plenty of support for gold because interest  rates will be coming down. It's just a matter of when.""
Looking ahead, Polleit said he sees  the Fed cutting interest rates later in the second half of the year. He added  that it's unlikely the central bank will have enough information to cut rates  before the summer.
Looking past interest rates and  inflation, Polleit said another area where the Federal Reserve and other  central banks are losing credibility is regarding the growing banking crisis.  Kicking off his press conference, Powell's first comment was that ""the banking  system is sound and resilient."" However, this was just days after First  Republic was the latest regional bank in the U.S. to collapse.

Polleit said the Federal Reserve is  downplaying the banking crisis to investors' detriment.
""The banking crisis is significant  and it's just getting started,"" he said. ""The flow of funds from small and  medium-sized banks is real. At the same time, they are seeing higher capital  costs. We also haven't seen the full impact of the commercial real estate  market.""
Polleit said that this uncertain  economic environment will continue to push investors to gold. He added that  with the bond market struggling along with the U.S. dollar, there are very few  safe-haven assets left for investors.
As to what could force gold back  below $2,000 an ounce, Polleit said that he doesn't see any of the new trends  in the global marketplace, like waning globalization or de-dollarization,  changing anytime soon.
""I'm convinced gold and silver are  going up as we see further increases in the money supply, lower interest rates  and further trouble in the banking sector spilling over into the general  economy,"" he said.

60,Lucid Motors Q1 2023 results: Production and deliveries drop,https://electrek.co/2023/05/08/lucid-motors-lcid-q1-2023-production-deliveries-drop-liquidity-remains-high/,"American automaker Lucid Motors has shared its financial report for Q1 2023 ahead of its call with shareholders later today. While year-over-year growth is encouraging, most numbers are down compared to last quarter. Still, the company remains quite optimistic about its future.
Although Lucid Motors ($LCID) still stumbled over a production finish line that it had to move up closer twice in 2022, the American EV automaker capped off the year on a high note. Q4 saw its highest output to date, producing nearly 3,500 Lucid Air sedans, although it only delivered 1,920 of them.
At that time, the company relayed that it still had 28,000 unfulfilled EV reservations, equating to approximately $2.7 billion in sales revenue should they all come to fruition. Despite falling significantly short on both initially anticipated production and deliveries last year, Lucid reported total liquidity of $4.9 billion – relaying that the company had enough capital to keep its operation going through at least Q1 of 2024.
Entering 2023, the automaker’s production guidance was targeting between 10,000-14,000 EVs and could land closer to the higher end if it were to maintain the 3,500 vehicle pace that began in Q4. 
In April, we learned that Q1 deliveries slipped a bit compared to a quarter ago, so Lucid will have some catching up to do in 2023. Following today’s more detailed quarterly report, the automaker relayed continued confidence that it will be able to produce at least 10,000 vehicles this year and still has plenty of money to get there.
Per the financial reports released by Lucid Motors this afternoon, its revenue for Q1 2023 was $149.4 million, which is a 159% increase compared to a year ago. In contrast to a quarter ago, however, Lucid’s revenue is down. In Q4 2022, the automaker reported $257.7 million.
You could blame seasonality for the higher numbers in Q4 as everyone scrambled to sell as many EVs as possible before year’s end, but Q1 2023 revenue is also down from Lucid’s Q3 2022 numbers ($195.5 million). Even so, the automaker still has loads of cash on hand and once again relayed confidence it will remain liquid for at least another year. Per Lucid CFO Sherry House:
Our Q1 revenue was approximately $149 million, which represented a year-over-year increase of 159%. We ended the quarter with just over $3.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and investments, with total liquidity of approximately $4.1 billion, which we believe is sufficient to fund the Company at least into Q2 of 2024. Our mission and optimism are unchanged. We are committed to an environmentally sustainable future – designing, building, and delivering the best EVs on the market.
As we reported last month, Lucid Motors produced 2,314 vehicles at its AMP-1 manufacturing facility in Arizona in Q1 2023 and delivered 1,406 of them. Following those numbers, the automaker has now focused on the lower end of its previous production guidance, stating it remains on track to produce 10,000 EVs this year.
Despite the positive tone Elektrek tries to spin on earnings report, this manufacturer may be heading to hit a brick wall soon. They lost $800M in liquidity and the sales numbers point to a demand problem despite what the article says. Production estimates for year now down to 10K. They will run out of cash by year end. Looks like a take over candidate. 
Company CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson briefly addressed the production guidance, and then quickly pivoted to promoting Lucid’s second model – the Gravity SUV, which is currently going through public road testing and is slotted to begin production in 2024. Per the release:
We are on track to produce over 10,000 vehicles in 2023, with company-wide initiatives ongoing that will enable Lucid to pivot to higher volumes as market conditions allow. We continue to grow our brand awareness and I’m proud to say that the Lucid Air was recently awarded a number of prestigious industry accolades. We will unveil our Gravity SUV later this year ahead of its launch in 2024 and we cannot wait for everyone to experience it. The Lucid Air redefined the luxury sedan category and we believe the continuing advancements of our in-house technology position our Gravity SUV to do the same in the SUV category – game-changing range, driving experience, charging speed, voluminous interior space, and an unrivaled combination of luxury and performance.
Lucid says the Gravity will be fully unveiled to the public later this year as the automaker continues Phase 2 construction of its Arizona facility to make way for SUV production and additional Air production capacity. The automaker said it would take its powertrain production facility, currently stationed up the road, and move it on-site as well.
Lastly, Lucid Motors says Air Pure availability will expand in the second half of 2023, and production of the tri-motor Air Sapphire will begin this summer.

61,Elizabeth Holmes Has Changed Her Voice Again,http://www.thecut.com/2023/05/elizabeth-holmes-voice-new-york-times-interview.html,"
Things you buy through our links may earn Vox Media a commission
Ever since she was sentenced to 11 years in prison for defrauding investors, Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes has been busy. In a new profile, the New York Times paid her a visit at her home in San Diego, where she lives with her partner, Billy Evans, and their two children. At the time she was interviewed, she was waiting to serve her sentence at Federal Prison Camp in Bryan, Texas, which was supposed to start at the end of April but has been pushed indefinitely owing to a last-minute appeal. This is the first time she has spoken to the press since before her trial, and a few things have changed — for example, she now goes by Liz, and she also talks in a far more normal voice.
Among the many bizarre details about the implosion of Holmes’s biotech start-up was the fake deep voice that many former employees claimed she used during her time as a young female entrepreneur. According to many accounts, she would occasionally forget to use the voice, especially when she was drunk. Although her family claimed in 2019 that Holmes’s baritone was, in fact, her real and naturally low voice, she has since stopped using it; one reporter at her trial described her speaking voice as a “normal alto” but noted that she dropped into a lower register when emphasizing certain words.
Now, it appears Holmes has officially put the voice behind her — as she would clearly like to do with the persona it represented. Times reporter Amy Chozick called Holmes’s current voice only “slightly low,” “soft,” and “totally unremarkable.” Holmes seems pretty open about the fact that she faked it: Throughout the interview, she refers to her Theranos persona as a “character” she created to be “taken seriously and not taken as a little girl or a girl who didn’t have good technical ideas.” She added, “Maybe people picked up on that not being authentic, since it wasn’t.” But she wants us to know that’s all in the past. The voice is so incredibly behind her, actually, that Holmes giggled at Evans’s impression of it while driving the family Tesla.
What else has Holmes been up to since we last heard from her? Volunteering at a rape crisis hotline, she is eager to mention. Also, raising her two kids, William and Invicta, with Evans. Evans entered the picture in 2017, when “Liz” was 32 and her company was imploding before her eyes, and after several Burning Man trips and a six-month RV adventure (Holmes did yoga and burned a “tribute to Theranos”), they attempted to settle in San Diego, where they say they have to constantly move because of Holmes’s notoriety. On the bright side, their 1-year-old, who was born during her trial, can apparently speak some Mandarin (??) and loves the zoo.
Also presumably set aflame in her Burning Man pyre: the black turtlenecks, which are nowhere to be seen in the family beach portrait featured in the profile. As Liz attempts to delay her prison sentence indefinitely, it sounds like the old Elizabeth can’t come to the phone right now.

64,Bitcoin BRC-20 Tokens Near $1 Billion Market Cap as Exchanges List ORDI - Decrypt,https://decrypt.co/139357/bitcoin-brc-20-tokens-near-billion-market-cap-exchanges-list-ordi,"Bitcoin BRC-20 Tokens Near $1 Billion Market Cap as Exchanges List ORDI
Meme token fever is sweeping through Bitcoin, as the market cap of tokens built on top of the leading cryptocurrency’s blockchain approached $1 billion on Monday after ORDI—the very first such token—was listed on major exchanges.
According to brc-20.io, which tracks the nascent market for tokens minted on the Bitcoin blockchain, the market cap of all BRC-20 tokens combined totals around $991 million, as of this writing. The market has surged in value, as well as number of tokens in circulation, over the last few days.
Short for ""Bitcoin Request for Comment,"" BRC-20 is an experimental framework for building fungible tokens on Bitcoin using Ordinals, the protocol that enables people to mint NFT-like assets on Bitcoin called inscriptions.
BRC-20 tokens have existed for two months. They were pioneered by the pseudonymous on-chain data enthusiast Domo, who took inspiration from the ERC-20 token standard on Ethereum and launched a token called ORDI on March 8.
Since then, Ordi has reached a market cap of around $400 million, according to brc-20.io. Other BRC-20 tokens like PEPE (a different token than the currently-hot Ethereum meme token of the same name), MEME, PIZA, and DOMO have followed suit as Bitcoin goes through the kind of meme coin mania that has gripped the wider crypto market in the past with Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and BONK.
On Monday, Ordi was listed for trading on Crypto.com and Gate.io, suggesting the experimental token is gaining mainstream adoption on cryptocurrency exchanges. As of this writing, the price of Ordi was $18.50 on Gate.io, a notable drop from its peak of $29.58 set earlier in the day.
Still, the current price of Ordi represents a steep increase from its price just one week ago, when Ordi traded hands at $3.78 on May 1, according to brc-20.io.
The volatility of BRC-20 tokens highlights the emergent nature of the Ordinals space, as text-based inscriptions—used to create and trade the tokens—take over and image-based inscriptions become less common. Yesterday, over 399,000 inscriptions were text-based compared to 20 that were image-based, according to data from Dune.
A record number of daily inscriptions was recorded yesterday as well at over 400,000, pushing the total number of inscriptions made past 4.5 million since the Ordinals protocol took off in late January.
The popularity of BRC-20 tokens is having a noticeable impact on Bitcoin transactions, overall. On Sunday, 65% of Bitcoin transactions were related to BRC-20 tokens, according to another Dune dashboard, and leading crypto exchange Binance briefly halted Bitcoin withdrawals due to network congestion.

65,"PayPal raises full-year profit above estimates on e-commerce strength, cost cuts",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypal-raises-full-profit-above-201657615.html,"May 8 (Reuters) -
PayPal Holdings Inc on Monday raised its annual profit forecast to above Wall Street estimates, buoyed by its higher quarterly profit as margins improved on cost-cut measures and as consumers undeterred by inflationary pressures keep shopping online.
While a cost-of-living crisis has now begun to squeeze budgets, particularly of lower income households, consumer spending has remained remarkably steady in the face of a looming economic slowdown.
The company's payments volume rose 12% on a forex-neutral basis to $354.5 billion in the first-quarter ended March 31.
The upbeat forecast echoes expectations of card giants Visa and Mastercard that have remained largely upbeat about spending volumes on pent-up travel demand and resilient consumer spending.
The company said it now expects full-year adjusted profit to grow about 20% to $4.95 per share, above analysts' average estimate of $4.88 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
The company has said in the past that it is focused on lowering expenses with executives cautioning that inflation was impacting discretionary consumer spending.
Adjusted operating margin in the first-quarter came in at 22.7% compared with 20.7% last year.
The payments firm said in January it would lay off 7% of its workforce, or about 2,000 employees in the backdrop of a high interest rate environment that has exacerbated fears around an upcoming recession.
PayPal's revenue rose 10% on a forex-neutral basis to $7.04 billion in the first-quarter.
The payments firm earned a profit of $1.17 per share on an adjusted basis in first-quarter, compared with 88 cents last year.
PayPal was one of the biggest winners during the COVID pandemic when people locked at home used its platform while shopping online. However, the company's growth slowed through the past year as countries around the world lifted restrictions and macroeconomic conditions deteriorated.

Bitcoin price chart on Monday. (CoinDesk)

Bitcoin (BTC) kicked off the U.S. trading week, falling below $27,500 in the afternoon (ET).
The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at around $27,350, down over 5.5% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data, as investors continued to mull over a surge in interest in the PEPE meme coin and Binance congestion issues that forced the exchange giant to temporarily suspend bitcoin withdrawals over the weekend.
Binance resumed the service Sunday night (ET), but the stoppages and rising price of bitcoin raised questions about the impact of large bitcoin transaction volume.
Ether (ETH) followed a similar pattern, falling beneath the $1,900 level it’s held for much of the past seven days. The second largest crypto in market value was trading at around $1,829, off 4.4% on a 24-hour basis.
ETH’s deflationary narrative post-Ethereum Shapella upgrade has strengthened as ETH’s net issuance, or the annualized inflation rate, recently dropped to -2.7%, according to ultrasound.money. More than 62,300 ETH, worth around $116 million, have been burned over the past seven days, ultrasound.money’s data tracker showed.
“Both BTC and ETH haven't tested near-term supports since the rally we saw around mid-March,"" Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, told CoinDesk in an email.
DiPasquale said BTC might test support between $25,000 and $27,000 before bouncing again, although the economic outlook is favorable for BTC and the broader crypto market to thrive. He called accumulating BTC and ETH on dips a “sound strategy.”
Most major tokens were also trading in the red on Monday, including crypto payment-focused XRP and Polygon’s MATIC, which both tanked over 8% to trade at around 42 cents and 92 cents, respectively. The PEPE craze appeared to be waning with its market cap dropping to some $878 million after peaking above $1 billion before the weekend, Messari data showed.
The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which measures the overall crypto market performance, was down over 5% for the day.
Greg Cipolaro, global head of research at bitcoin investment firm NYDIG, wrote in a Friday newsletter that despite short-term price fluctuation, BTC is increasingly serving as a “buy-and-hold asset” based on on-chain data.
“With more bitcoins being held for longer, a dwindling supply is available for short-term trading,” Cipolaro wrote, adding that this may result in increased volatility or trading costs through wider spreads.
“Given bitcoin’s fixed supply nature, this also means that fewer bitcoins are available for others to purchase. This may result in upward pressure on prices if the demand for bitcoin grows,” he wrote.
Equity markets turned mixed on Monday midday, with the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite trading almost flat, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) was down 0.1%.
In bond markets, the note on the 2-year Treasury yield – a gauge of near-term, interest rate expectations – edged 8 basis points higher to sit around 3.99%. The note on the 10-year Treasury yield also rose 7 basis points to 3.51%.

69,Now Biden is going after your DISHWASHERS: new rules to fight climate change | Daily Mail Online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12059961/Now-Biden-going-DISHWASHERS-new-rules-fight-climate-change.html,"By James Franey, Senior U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.Com

Joe Biden will face fresh accusations of meddling in the lives of American households after his administration announced a green crackdown on dishwashers.
His Department of Energy quietly released tighter rules for the home appliances on Friday afternoon as millions of people across the country prepared to celebrate Cinco de Mayo.
The annual nationwide festivities mark the anniversary of Mexico's victory over the French at the Battle of Puebla in 1862.
The rules, which form part of the administration’s climate change agenda, would slash water use by more than one-third and cut energy use limits by 27% for dishwashers in the U.S.
Any changes would only apply to new models on sale once the new rules have officially come into effect, expected to be 2027.
The new rules would force manufacturers to limit dishwashers to using 3.2 gallons of water per cycle, far below the current federal limit of 5 gallons.
Critics of the new rules, released ahead of the U.S. Cinco de Mayo festivities, say they could push up appliance prices for customers.
President Joe Biden's Department of Energy is pushing his green agenda by wanting dishwasher manufacturers to make the machines even more efficient 
It would also require manufacturers to reduce their products' energy consumption by nearly 30%.
Most dishwashers on the market are already well below the federal standard, with most using 3.5 gallons per cycle or less.
Jill Notini, a spokeswoman for the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, warned that ordinary Americans will ultimately pick up the tab for the new rules.
 'Consumers will pay the real price,' she told DailyMail.com. 'The Department of Energy has proposed very stringent standards for home appliances that will require higher upfront costs to purchase a product.'
'Manufacturers just want to be able to deliver high performing, fully featured products at costs that consumers of all incomes can afford. The DoE is making that very difficult with the standards they are proposing,' Ms Notini added. 
But administration officials claim that the plans will ‘lower costs for American families and businesses while tackling the climate crisis.’
Abgail Marone, an aide to Josh Hawley, a Republican senator from Missouri, accused the Biden administration of peddling 'a radical green energy agenda.'
‘Leave our dishwashers alone,’ she said.
It marks the latest step in what has been branded the administration’s ‘war’ on home appliances in a bid to cut emissions and save energy.
Republicans recently reacted with fury after a Biden-appointed safety regulator suggested that authorities could ban gas stoves considered to be major polluters.
CPSC commissioner Richard Trumka Jr. said earlier this year that ‘gas stove regulation has reached a boiling point.
Trumka claimed the body 'has the responsibility to ban consumer products that emit hazardous substances, particularly, when those emissions harm children.'
'Any option is on the table. Products that can't be made safe can be banned,' he said.
He later forced to clarify that he had been speaking about new products, and that a retrospective gas stove ban was not being considered.
Gas stove manufacturers argue that they are just as harmful as other means of cooking 
The Energy Department also wants new efficiency standards for washing machines, but industry insiders are complaining that the regulations will soil laundry day 
The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission makes decisions independently from the executive branch.
But a leaked memo from October 2022, first obtained by Fox News, showed the top safety watchdog was considering tightening the rules on dangerous emissions.
Biden’s Department of Energy has already pushed through stricter environmental standards on washing machines and refrigerators that have been described as ‘overregulation on steroids.’
On his first day in office in January 2021, he signed an executive order telling DoE officials to make ‘major revisions’ to current appliance regulation standards.
A month later, the agency listed more than a dozen energy efficiency rules, impacting appliances like water heaters, cooking products and lamps, that it would review.
At the end of last year, the White House released a statement boasting that it had taken action against 110 household appliances to help cut emissions.

70,Apple loses bid to revive US copyright claims over iOS simulation | Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/legal/apple-loses-bid-revive-us-copyright-claims-over-ios-simulation-2023-05-08/,"May 8 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on Monday failed to convince a U.S. appeals court that security startup Corellium Inc infringed its copyrights by simulating its iOS operating system to help researchers find security flaws in Apple devices.
The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Corellium lawfully recreated Apple's system under the U.S. copyright doctrine of fair use, furthering scientific progress by aiding important security research.
Representatives for the companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the decision.
Florida-based Corellium's software allows users to run iOS on non-Apple devices and inspect and modify the operating system in ways that allow security researchers to search for vulnerabilities more effectively. Apple sued Corellium for copyright infringement in South Florida federal court in 2019.
Apple unsuccessfully tried to buy Corellium for nearly $23 million before filing the lawsuit, the appeals court said.
The district court dismissed Apple's claims over Corellium's iOS simulator in 2020. Apple appealed in 2021.
The 11th Circuit agreed that Corellium made fair use of iOS on Monday and said Corellium's software adds new features that help security researchers ""do their work in a way that physical iPhones just can't.""
The appeals court rejected Apple's arguments that Corellium simply repackaged iOS in a different format for profit, harming Apple's market for its operating system and its security-research programs.
Corellium ""opened the door for deeper security research into operating systems like iOS,"" the circuit court said.
The appeals court sent the case back to the district court to consider if Corellium infringed copyrights covering Apple's icons and wallpapers or contributed to infringement by third parties.

71,JPMorgan sues Charlie Javice -- then has to pay her legal fees,https://nypost.com/2023/05/08/jpmorgan-sues-charlie-javice-then-has-to-pay-her-legal-fees/,"
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	
A judge has ordered JPMorgan Chase to pay Charlie Javice’s legal fees — even as the mega-bank sues the embattled Frank founder for fraud in its $175 million acquisition of her company.
Delaware Chancery Court Judge Kathaleen McCormick ruled on Monday that JPMorgan was legally obligated to pay 31-year-old Javice’s defense costs. It’s also likely the ruling includes Javice’s defense in criminal fraud charges brought by federal prosecutors.
To avoid paying Javice’s legal fees, JPMorgan had previously argued that the payments fell outside its September 2021 acquisition agreement with Javice, where the bank had agreed to purchase Javice’s college financial-planning site, Frank, for $175 million.
As a result of the acquisition, however, Javice was hired by by JPMorgan as a managing director of Frank. Accordingly, Javice had argued she was entitled to payment of her legal fees as a JPMorgan employee.
Judge McCormick on Monday sided with Javice, ruling that the contract lacked a “carve out” to free JPMorgan from its obligations.
Javice — along with with Frank’s chief growth and acquisition officer, Olivier Amar — reportedly received $26 million from the deal.
Javice — who was named on Forbes’s 2019 “30 under 30” list in finance — was fired from her role at JPMorgan last November when it was revealed that she allegedly used fake customer data to get the bank to buy her company. 
According to a lawsuit filed by JPMorgan in December, the acquisition was completed under the guise that Frank “was a business deeply engaged with the college-aged market segment with 4.265 million customers.”
JPMorgan instead “received a business with fewer than 300,000 customers,” as stated in the explosive suit.
As a result, the Frank founder is facing criminal charges for conspiracy, wire fraud, bank fraud and securities fraud. She faces more than 100 years in jail if convicted.
She has not entered a plea in the case after being charged in federal court in Manhattan last month. However, she has had “discussions regarding a possible disposition of this case,” Assistant US Attorney Dina McLeod said in a filing disclosed publicly on Thursday.
Since being fired, Javice countersued the bank with claims that she was owed millions in legal expenses as a result of an internal investigation from last spring.
She also claimed that she was owed $20 million more in a bonus payment, and alleged that she was fired so JPMorgan could skirt it.
Alex Spiro, Javice’s attorney, called JPMorgan’s lawsuit “nothing but a cover.”
Spiro didn’t immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment following the latest advancements in Javice’s suit against the bank.
JPMorgan has also sued Amar for his participation in the alleged fraud.
According to the Department of Justice criminal complaint, Javice and Amar allegedly hired a data scientist for $18,000 to fabricate a list of fake names and addresses that were passed off as customers.
That data scientist then used computer-generated data to create a fake user base that included information such as customers’ names, birthdates, and colleges they attended, the lawsuit claimed.
Amar has not been charged in the criminal case, but he has countersued JPMorgan demanding the bank cover his legal fees. In their suits, both Amar and Javice claimed they deserved coverage under JPMorgan’s policies since they were employees as a result of the bank’s merger with Frank.
JPMorgan also will be paying Amar’s defense costs, according to a spokesman for the bank.",1

Surveillance video shows Kentavious White, 26, called his manager to the door of a McDonald’s in Moultrie before shooting and killing her, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.
White then turned the gun on himself, agents said.
Authorities responded to the restaurant May 4 and found their bodies inside, investigators said. The woman who died was identified as Amia Smith.
“She had just gotten an award, I think it was in December, for some achievement,” Smith’s cousin, Felicia Mcgough, told WALB. “For this to happen with someone that actually worked there. I guess you’re just not safe anywhere.”
White, who authorities said was involved in separate shootings the day before, is also accused of killing his mother and grandmother, Police Chief Sean Ladson told The Moultrie Observer.
Susie Arnold, 50, and Hilda Marshall, 74, were found shot inside their homes, which are next door to each other, the newspaper reported. One of the women was still alive when agents found her, authorities said, but she died from her injuries.
The victims’ autopsies will be handled by the GBI, according to a news release.
Authorities didn’t say if they had determined a motive for the shootings, but said the case is under investigation.

In the streaming wars, ""you need fewer companies or you need higher prices, or it doesn't work,"" the Berkshire Hathaway founder said.

							By 

	Alex Weprin

Media & Business Writer

	Paramount’s difficult quarter appears to have given one of the company’s largest outside shareholders some pause.

	On Saturday, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway held its annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. And, as is tradition, Buffett and his Berkshire vice chairman Charlie Munger answered dozens of questions from shareholders, over multiple hours.



	While many of the questions tackled the global economy, inflation, Apple, artificial intelligence and Berkshire’s lucrative insurance businesses, one question homed in on a particular Berkshire holding: Paramount Global. Buffett and Berkshire own about 94 million Paramount shares, currently valued at about $1.6 billion, per Berkshire’s latest filings.

	A Berkshire shareholder asked whether Buffett still had “conviction in his investment thesis” in Paramount, and how he sees the streaming wars evolving.

	Paramount slashed its dividend last week as it sought to conserve free cash flow and shift its streaming business toward profitability.

	“It’s not good news when any company cuts its dividend dramatically,” Buffett told the shareholder.

	But his comments on the streaming wars suggest that the legendary investor sees a long, drawn-out, bloody battle for, as he calls it, “eyeballs.”

	“The streaming business is extremely interesting to watch, because people love to use their eyeballs being entertained on a screen in front of them or a phone, whatever it may be, but there is a lot of companies doing it, and you need fewer companies or you need higher prices, or it doesn’t work,” Buffett said.

	Buffett went on to recall a time when he owned a gas station in Omaha and found that his profits were being determined by a larger station down the street. “He determined our profit, because we looked at his price every day,” Buffett said, adding that his station eventually went under because they couldn’t compete in price and make a profit.

	In the streaming wars, “you’ve got a bunch of companies that don’t want to quit. Who knows what pricing does under that?” Buffett said.

	Berkshire first bought into Paramount about a year ago and has increased its stake since then. The stake has lost more than a billion dollars in value since Berkshire bought it, but so far Buffett’s firm hasn’t sold.

75,"Drug Contractor Catalent Plunges After Annual Guidance Cut, Results Delayed",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/drug-contractor-catalent-plunges-annual-135520974.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Catalent Inc. shares traded at their lowest in three years following cuts to its annual financial outlook that hurt investor confidence in the contract drug manufacturer.

The company expects to reduce its guidance for net revenue and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by at least $400 million each, according to a statement Monday, and to push back the release of its third-quarter earnings results until May 15. The shares sank to about $34, their lowest price since March 2020. The drop of as much as 28% was the biggest since April 14.
That was the day Catalent said its financial results would be affected by high costs and production issues at three plants and announced a new interim chief financial officer, following Thomas Castellano’s departure from the company. Days later, Bloomberg reported that Danaher Corp. was no longer considering a takeover of Catalent, according to people familiar with the situation. Danaher had earlier made overtures to the company valuing it at a significant premium.
The Monday warning “is the latest (and perhaps largest) shoe to drop” at Catalent, Stephens Inc. analysts led by Jacob Johnson said in a note to clients. “This raises a variety of questions including the impact to potential strategic interest.”
Bank of America Securities Inc. analysts downgraded Catalent to underperform from neutral, saying they “lack confidence in quick recovery.” The announcement was “a much steeper cut than what had been anticipated” and raises further questions about Catalent’s operational issues, wrote analysts Derik de Bruin and Michael Ryskin.
In April, Catalent said revenue was hit after its Maryland manufacturing site was unable to ramp up production capacity for a customer’s product as quickly as anticipated. On Monday, the company cited operational and productivity issues for the reduction, ruling out the loss of a customer or order.
Catalent also said it had “identified significant issues with its forecasts over the past year” and potential non-cash adjustments related to its operations in Bloomington, Indiana. The company didn’t respond to requests for comment.
In February, Catalent had predicted annual net revenue between $4.63 billion and $4.88 billion. Adjusted Ebitda was expected to be between $1.22 billion to $1.3 billion.
“We are dissatisfied with our recent results and are taking the necessary steps to address the issues that negatively impacted our performance,” Chief Executive Officer Alessandro Maselli said in the Monday statement.
Other activity in the contract manufacturing space includes the $4.25 billion cash sale of a Baxter International Inc. unit to investor Warburg Pincus and private equity firm Advent International Monday.

The satellite TV company, led by chairman Charlie Ergen and CEO Erik Carlson, had a decline of 462,000 in the year-ago quarter.

							By 

	Etan Vlessing

Canada Bureau Chief

Dish Network reported that it lost about 552,000 net pay TV subscribers in the first quarter, compared with a decline of 462,000 in the year-ago period and a drop of 268,000 in the fourth quarter of 2022.

	The company, led by CEO Erik Carlson and chairman Charlie Ergen, ended the financial quarter with 9.2 million total subscribers. That includes 7.09 million Dish TV customers and 2.1 million Sling TV subscribers, which faces stiff competition from YouTube TV, Hulu+ Live TV and fuboTV.



	Dish has been consistently losing pay TV subscriber amid cord-cutting and a shift in consumers to streaming platforms, and more recently saw its subscriber base impacted by an internal cybersecurity attack. The company had an overall pay TV customer base of 9.75 million at the end of the first quarter of 2022.

					Sling TV Raises Prices as Dish Adds Pay Subscribers		
			








	Dish is looking to transform itself from a satellite TV provider in decline to offering a 5G wireless network as part of a broadband wireless business. The company lost 81,000 wireless phone subscribers during the first quarter, against a year-earlier loss 343,000 customers to close the latest quarter with 7.91 million subscribers.

	The latest subscriber losses — where Dish’s retail satellite TV business is shedding subscribers at a faster pace than losses for its retail wireless business — had overall revenues falling to $3.96 billion for the first quarter, compared to $4.33 billion in the year ago period.

	And net income attributable to shareholders fell to $233 million, compared to $433 million for the first quarter of 2022.

	On a morning analyst call, Dish Network execs said the fallout from a previously-disclosed network outage in February due to a cybersecurity attack fell most heavily on Sling TV, as late fees for monthly invoices were waived after payment systems and call centers went offline.

	“That’s where the impact happened,” Carlson reported as efforts to acquire and retain Sling TV customers took a hit, even as Dish Network execs were keen to dispel concerns the ransomware attack would have a long term impact on the pay TV brand and and its subscriber count. 

	Stock in Dish Network edged up 4 cents, or .5 percent, to $7.16 in early afternoon trading. 

	Dish Network has seen its share price fall amid investor concerns over the company’s high debt load to build out its broadband wireless business as interest rates rise and pay TV and wireless phone revenues continue under pressure.

	










	“We have a path and it’s not evident to people on this call, but we have a path and we have to execute on that and hope that it doesn’t get any worse in the marketplace,” Charlie Ergen told analysts as he touted his company’s evolving 5G wireless phone network build-out.

78,"Cyberattacks a Problem for Nearby EDs, Too | MedPage Today",https://www.medpagetoday.com/special-reports/features/104392,"
      by
             Michael DePeau-Wilson, Enterprise & Investigative Writer, MedPage Today                                
        May 8, 2023
      

A ransomware attack at one healthcare system had a significant impact on two neighboring emergency departments (EDs) that weren't targeted in the attack, researchers found.
Daily mean ED volume rose 15.1% at the two facilities, from 218.4 in the pre-attack period to 251.4 in the attack period (P<0.001), Christian Dameff, MD, MS, of the University of California San Diego, and colleagues reported in JAMA Network Open.
Mean ambulance arrivals rose 35.2% from 1,741 prior to the attack to 2,354 during the attack (P<0.001), and there was a 127.8% increase in visits where patients left without being seen (from 158 to 360, P<0.001).
The researchers also reported increases in patients who left against medical advice (50.4% increase), median waiting room times (47.6% increase), and median total length of stay for admitted patients (33.9% increase).
In the post-attack period, only some parameters  --  such as EMS arrivals and patients who left against medical advice  --  returned to pre-attack rates, the authors noted.
Anecdotal reports from clinicians said disruptions were most pronounced during the first 2 weeks of the attack, and were likely the result of ""early chaos when no mitigations existed yet for hospitals to develop ad hoc workarounds,"" the researchers observed.
""Ransomware attacks on hospital systems have previously been reported to be costly and disabling,"" they wrote. ""Increases in healthcare cybersecurity incidents suggest the need for coordinated regional surge planning similar to that conducted for natural disasters.""
""Increasing cyberattack prevention efforts and operational resiliency across all healthcare systems should be a high national priority,"" they continued. ""These findings support the need for coordinated regional cyber disaster planning, further study on the potential patient care effects of cyberattacks, and continued work to build technical healthcare systems resilient to cyberattacks such as ransomware.""
The team noted that proper planning and coordination across groups of healthcare delivery organizations, such as hospitals, community health centers, and home health agencies in a designated region, could help mitigate the negative effects found in this analysis.
""Hospital systems infected with ransomware can likely reduce regional effects by developing cyberattack-specific emergency operations plans to minimize recovery times in addition to engaging regional partners to proactively plan for and drill for cyberattacks,"" the researchers wrote.
They suggested measures including limiting elective surgeries when an attack occurs at a nearby healthcare delivery organization. The investigators also highlighted the need to anticipate risks to specific individuals, such as stroke and trauma patients, and recommended that ""measures to rapidly facilitate transfers among hospitals should be prioritized.""
They noted, for example, that several hospitals in the targeted health system were stroke centers, which meant high-acuity patients needed to be transported to other stroke centers in the area. One of the two facilities saw a 74.6% increase in stroke code activations and a 113.6% increase in confirmed strokes from the pre-attack phase to the attack phase, they noted.
For their study, Dameff and colleagues examined adult and pediatric patient volume as well as stroke care data from two urban academic EDs in San Diego County. They collected data from the 4 weeks prior to a ransomware attack that occurred on May 1, 2021, and the period during the attack and initial recovery through May 28, 2021. They also collected data from the 4 weeks thereafter.
Ultimately, the analysis included data on 19,857 ED visits, including 6,114 prior to the attack phase, 7,039 during the attack phase, and 6,704 after the attack phase. The patient demographic data were similar in all three phases of the study, the researchers said.

79,Virgin Galactic set for first spaceflight since Richard Branson's trip two years ago | CNN Business,https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/08/business/virgin-galactic-space-tourism-test-flight-scn/index.html,"Markets

      Virgin Galactic, the suborbital space tourism company founded by British billionaire Richard Branson, is gearing up for its first flight to the edge of space in nearly two years. 
  

      The flight, slated for late May, will carry two pilots and a crew of four Virgin Galactic employees, the company announced Monday. The company expects it will be the final test run before Virgin Galactic can open up rides for paying customers after years of promises, missed deadlines, and Branson selling off a huge chunk of his original stake in the company.
  

      If all goes well, Virgin Galactic expects to begin commercial services out of its spaceport in New Mexico in late June.
  

      Virgin Galactic had appeared poised to begin commercial operations after it launched Branson to the edge of space alongside three crewmates in July 2021, a flight that came less than two weeks before Branson’s rival Jeff Bezos conducted his own flight to the edge of space. Branson denied he had been racing with Bezos.
  

      But the Federal Aviation Administration, which licenses commercial rocket launches, later opened an investigation into Branson’s flight when it was revealed that the space plane veered off course during the high-profile flight. 
  

Virgin Galactic reopens space tourism ticket sales


      That investigation concluded in September 2021 and gave Virgin Galactic the all-clear for more flights. But the company then announced it was delaying the start of commercial services, citing unrelated technology upgrades. 
  

      Several deadlines for the company’s expected return to space have passed. At one point in early 2022, the company was targeting as early as last October for its first commercial missions. At the time Virgin Galactic went public in 2019, it had also been touting plans to start commercial service in 2020. 
  

      “We are making good progress on validating the enhancements made throughout 2022, and we remain on track for commercial service in Q2 of this year,” CEO Michael Colglazier told investors during the company’s latest earnings call on February 28, 2023.
  

      Virgin Galactic conducted several test flights before Branson’s flight in 2021. But since then, the company has flown only one test flight of VSS Unity, which sent the space plane gliding through the air but did not attempt to fire up the plane’s rocket engine.
  

      The company has also been losing money for years, burning through funds as it attempts to finish its qualification flights and begin welcoming customers on board — some of whom paid for their tickets more than a decade ago.
  

      The company has sold about 800 tickets total, including 600 at prices ranging from $200,000 to $250,000 and 200 more at $450,000, which is the current ticket price, a spokesperson confirmed on Monday.
  

      Virgin Galactic is competing directly with Bezos’ Blue Origin in the suborbital space tourism business. Since Bezos’ flight in July 2021, the company has since completed five additional crewed flights to space. Blue Origin’s operations, however, have been on pause since an uncrewed flight of its New Shepard rocket exploded in September 2022.
  

      Six people will be on board Virgin Galactic’s VSS Unity space plane for this month’s test mission. They include two pilots — CJ Sturckow and Mike Masucci — as well as four Virgin Galactic employees who will ride in the passenger cabin. Those four are Jamila Gilbert, a New Mexican native who works in the company’s internal communications; Chris Hume, a flight sciences engineer and the son of Jamaican immigrants; Luke Mays, an astronaut instructor and former NASA employee; and Beth Moses, the company’s head of astronaut training, who has joined two prior flights.
  

      Virgin Galactic’s rocket-powered plane, called VSS Unity, is designed to ride to about 50,000 feet while attached beneath the wing of a massive, twin-fuselage mothership, dubbed “Eve” by the company. The space plane is designed to then detach from the mothership, fire its rocket engine and swoop straight up with its two pilots at the controls. Flights are designed to reach more than 50 miles above Earth, into altitudes the US government recognizes as the boundary of outer space. 
  

      Not every institution recognizes the 50-mile mark. Internationally, it’s more common to use the Kármán Line, which lies 62 miles (100 kilometers) above Earth’s surface.
  

      At the peak of the flight, customers are expected to experience a few minutes of weightlessness and can peer out the plane’s windows at Earth’s curved horizon and the blackness of outer space. VSS Unity then aims to glide to a landing back at the launch site. From takeoff to landing, the missions typically last under two hours. 
  

      Virgin Orbit, a sister company to Virgin Galactic that is focused on launching satellites to space on a small rocket, filed for bankruptcy in April.

80,Western Digital tells customers that hackers stole their data | TechCrunch,https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/08/western-digital-tells-customers-that-hackers-stole-their-data/,"On Friday, a month after the company revealed it had been the victim of a data breach, Western Digital published an update on the incident and notified customers that their data was stolen.
In a press release, the company said that on March 26 it detected a “a network security incident” where hackers “gained access to a number of the Company’s systems.”
“As a precautionary measure to secure our business operations, the Company proactively disconnected our systems and services from the public Internet. We are progressing through our restoration process and the majority of our impacted systems and services are now operational,” the company wrote.
Western Digital wrote that working with “outside forensic experts” it confirmed that hackers “obtained a copy of a Western Digital database used for our online store that contained some personal information of our online store customers.”
The stolen data included “customer names, billing and shipping addresses, email addresses and telephone numbers,” as well as “passwords and partial credit card numbers” that were encrypted, hashed, and salted, a process that hides the original plaintext data and makes it significantly harder for hackers to actually see the real passwords and partial credit card numbers.
The company also notified customers who were victims’ of the hack. A Western Digital customer shared the message the company sent him with TechCrunch, which matches the messages included in other articles.

In the message sent via email, the company told customers it was writing to notify them “about a network security incident involving your Western Digital online store account.”
The company also wrote that victims can take precautionary measures to protect themselves, including being “cautious of any unsolicited communications that ask for your personal information or refer you to a web page asking for personal information,” avoiding clicking on links or downloading attachments “from suspicious emails,” and checking whether their email accounts have spam settings that can help detect and block “suspicious emails.”
Western Digital spokespeople Charlie Smalling declined to comment when asked to specify how many customers were affected, referring back to the update published Friday.
On April 3, Western Digital revealed it had been the victim of a data breach, without detailing the extent of the breach or what data had been stolen. Days later, one of the hackers involved in the attack told TechCrunch that the stolen data amounted to 10 terabytes and included customer information.
At the time, the hackers were trying to extort the company promising not to publish the stolen data.
“We are the vermin who breached your company. Perhaps your attention is needed!” the hackers wrote, according to a copy of the email the hackers shared with TechCrunch. “Continue down this path and we will retaliate.”
Apparently, Western Digital did not heed these pleas, because the hackers went on and published some of the stolen data on the website of the ransomware gang Alphv. In a post on April 28, the hackers said they would “share leaks every week until we lose interest” including “code signing certificates, firmware, personally identifiable information of customers, and more.”
It doesn’t appear the hackers have yet published the full trove of stolen data.

81,City of Rochester invests $2M in accessible healthy food as Rite Aid prepares to close - WHEC.com,https://www.whec.com/local/city-invests-2m-to-make-healthy-food-more-accessible-after-rite-aid-announces-closure/,"ROCHESTER, N.Y. — Many of the city’s 200,000 residents live in food deserts, neighborhoods where options to buy grocery items are limited.
Now, the City of Rochester is targeting $2 million in a push to make healthy food more available. Mayor Malik Evans says the city wants to partner with businesses that see Rochester as an asset and offer healthy, quality food options.
“One thing we’re not going to do is beg. The residents of Rochester shouldn’t have to beg to have healthy food accessibility,” Evans said. “We should not have to beg to have pharmacies in our neighborhoods and isn’t it a shame that some of our neighborhoods feel as though they have to beg but we’re not going to because we feel as though we should not have to.”
The city is making $2 million in grants available to businesses so they can sell more nutritious foods. The money will come out of a $5 million investment that the city already made in addressing food deserts. The funds are part of the using American Rescue Plan Act.
“This financial assistance will be available to a wide variety of businesses, neighborhood markets, meat markets, small scale grocers, specialty food stores, whole sellers, and restaurants that focus on healthy foods or that are looking to sell healthy, affordable grocery or specialty items,” Evans said.
In two days, the Rite Aid on Portland Avenue will close, which is causing concern for neighbors who rely on it for food and prescriptions.
Evans said the announcement is disappointing, especially coming just months after Walgreens pulled out of the 19th Ward.
“I want businesses in our community to hear me when I say this. We want to collaborate and work with any of you that need the city’s help so we can avoid having surprises like this in the future,” Evans said.
He fears this latest closure will have a detrimental impact on a neighborhood that does not have a grocery store. Other retailers that sell food are blocks away.
“We are invested in making sure that we bring assets and amenities to our community,” said City Council President Miguel Melendez. “And to lose one at this time, at such an important intersection in our community Clifford and portland avenue, it’s painful.”
The grants will total between $25,000 and $250,000. Applications are accepted through Friday, May 19. You can learn how to apply through the city’s website here.
In the meantime, city leaders hope that Rite Aid will reconsider closing. Evans says the city would love to see stores like Aldi and Tops build in Rochester. Also, the city will help caterers and food trucks who are looking to establish a brick-and-mortar location.
Evans says the city is looking at how to use urban farmers to help get access to more urban fruits and vegetables. The city currently has a garden initiative to plant more gardens on city-owned lots to get more fresh foods in the neighborhoods.

82,Bank of Canada asks for public feedback about a national digital currency | Engadget,https://www.engadget.com/bank-of-canada-asks-for-public-feedback-about-a-national-digital-currency-172630056.html,"The Bank of Canada wants the public’s opinions on a potential digital Canadian dollar. Although the country’s central bank says a national digital currency isn’t yet needed, it wants to remain flexible and ready should that ever change.
“As Canada’s central bank, we want to make sure everyone can always take part in our country’s economy. That means being ready for whatever the future holds,” said Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Rogers in a press release published today. The bank cites the diminishing use of cash, potential competition with cryptocurrencies and national economic stability as reasons to prepare for the potential shift.
“The Bank has been providing bank notes to Canadians for more than 85 years,” its announcement states. “Cash is a safe, accessible and trusted method of payment that anyone can use, including people who don’t have a bank account, a credit score or official identification documents. However, there may come a time when bank notes are not widely used in day-to-day transactions, which could risk excluding many Canadians from taking part in the economy.”
Although cryptocurrency is less of a threat to traditional financial institutions after last year’s epic collapses, it’s still a looming danger that likely motivated this move. If decentralized currencies ever became widely enough used to reduce demand for the Canadian dollar, that could threaten the bank’s (and government’s) ability to assert control over the economy, maintain stability and implement policies. “A digital Canadian dollar would ensure Canadians always have an official, safe, and stable digital payment option issued by Canada’s central bank,” the bank says. But it also emphasized that, even if it eventually launched a national digital currency, it would still issue bank notes for anyone who wants them. “Cash isn’t going anywhere,” it unequivocally states.
The survey is a standard online questionnaire about how Canadians would likely use digital currency, which security features are essential, and their concerns about accessibility and privacy. “We want to hear from Canadians about what they value most in the design of a digital dollar. This will help us make design choices and ensure that it is secure, reliable and meets the needs of Canadians,” said Rogers. The bank says Canadians’ feedback “will be kept anonymous, confidential, and be reported in aggregate only.”",1

84,Bud Light sales are tanking. Can Anheuser-Busch recover its core customer base?,https://www.stltoday.com/business/local/bud-light-sales-are-tanking-can-anheuser-busch-recover-its-core-customer-base/article_2d7a63e2-e9cf-11ed-9c3c-3faa4ae04c46.html,"Post-Dispatch business reporters bring you insights into the latest news in the St. Louis business community.
Empty Bud Light aluminum bottles are scattered in a seating area at Busch Stadium following a Cardinals loss to the Angels on Thursday, May 4, 2023.
For years, Budweiser was the King of Beers and Anheuser-Busch was the King of Marketing. Its commercials on television, radio and print were the envy of the advertising world. 
Now, a single promotional initiative gone awry threatens the company’s standing as a marketing machine.
Bud Light is the top-selling beer in America, but its frothy sales have taken a massive hit in the past month. A short TikTok video by transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney, and a single can of beer with her face on it, has brought the once-mighty A-B marketing machine crashing to the ground.
“It basically was a post from an influencer that got blown very far out of proportion. It has been adopted by a certain section of the country as the calling card for anti-trans (support). They’re calling to boycott Bud Light,” said David Steinman, vice president and executive editor of industry publication Beer Marketer’s Insights.
The informal boycott has been successful, slashing the brand’s sales by as much as 26% in a single week. If the trend continues, Bud Light could lose its position as the No. 1 beer in America, said Bump Williams of Bump Williams Consulting, which specializes in the alcoholic beverage industry.
What went wrong?
“It’s self-inflicted,” said Robert Lachky, former chief creative officer at Anheuser-Busch.
Called “One of adworld’s greatest fixtures” by AdAge magazine, Lachky worked on the “Whassup?!” and frogs campaigns, as well as the iconic Clydesdale ads of the 1990s and 2000s and “Real Men of Genius,” which received more awards than any other radio campaign.
“It’s a complete lack of corporate oversight, and it’s been that way since (InBev) took the company over,” he said.
InBev, a Belgian-based international brewery, bought Anheuser-Busch in 2009 and forced out many executives, including Lachky, and overhauled the marketing staff.
“Effectively, it took us 20 years to take Bud Light beer to the No. 1 beer in the country, and it took them one week to dismantle it,” Lachky said.
Anheuser-Busch was flying high in 1979, when it launched one of the most effective and memorable taglines of all time, “This Bud’s for you.”
That campaign was followed by one hit after another. Three frogs croaking “Bud,” “Weis” and “Errrrr” proved to be enduringly popular — a writer at Adweek later called it one of the “most iconic alcohol campaigns in advertising history.”
A campaign featuring friends calling each other and saying “Whassup?” followed, and was an equally huge hit.
Sales soared. At its peak, in 1988, Anheuser-Busch brewed more than 50 million barrels of Bud. And when the brand slipped to No. 2 in 2001, the beer that surpassed it was Bud Light.
Bud Light’s current tagline, “Easy to drink, easy to enjoy” was unveiled February in a commercial that aired during the 2023 Super Bowl. In an earnings call with investors and analysts on Thursday, A-B InBev chief executive officer Michel Doukeris called the tagline “a strong message for Bud Light.”
Perry Drake, who teaches marketing at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, disagrees.
“It sounds like a tagline for a nice glass of white wine if you ask me. Not Bud Light,” he said.
But that is a potential minor misstep compared to the apparent marketing faceplant of working with a transgender influencer. That problem was then compounded by the brand’s marketing director, who is now on a leave of absence, insinuating that Bud Light drinkers are all frat boys.
The marketing director’s remarks were an unforced error, but the idea of appealing to the LGBTQ community was fine and well-intentioned, Drake said.
“I think it was executed really badly. They broke one of the rules of influencer marketing, and that is to make sure your influencer aligns with your customer segment,” he said.
The mistake shocked him, because the marketing people at Anheuser-Busch pride themselves for knowing their customers well and engaging with them, he said.
“If you want to work with the LGBTQ community, there are ways to do that. You could release rainbow-colored cans during Pride Week, and (customers) could buy them or not, as they choose,” Drake said.
“It’s Marketing 101, as far as I’m concerned.”
Pier Yvette Alsup, teaches a class in inclusive marketing strategies at Washington University. She said that the idea of using a transgender influencer to promote Bud Light was smart and forward-thinking, a way to reach new customers.
“If you’re trying to reach a new market or an emergent market and you’re looking at what’s changing in terms of demographics, you should be aware of their values,” she said.
Appealing to young beer-drinkers made sense from a marketing point of view, she said.
“(But) I think the timing may not have been ideal. Reading the room, we as Americans are in a hyperpolitical period,” she said.
Alsup cited a 2021 survey by the Bauer Leadership Center at Washington University and Vrity in which 55% of respondents said they paid more attention to the political stands of companies than they did just one year before.
Generations X, Y and Z — people born between 1965 and 2012 — were especially inclined to look at a brand’s values before purchasing.
Getting through the crisis and restoring some of the lost business will require a corporate mea culpa.
“You go out there and you say, ‘We don’t always get things right even with the best intentions. But there’s always room for improvement as a company and we’re always learning new things. And we want to keep the lines of communication open,’” Alsup said.
Drake, at UMSL, said he thought it would be best for Anheuser-Busch to keep quiet and let the controversy die out. The overall impact on the company should be minimal, he said.
“In the long term, I think it will be forgotten. It will just be something that will show up when you Google ‘the 10 worst marketing campaigns ever.’”

85,'Outraged' letter carriers demand action to stop robberies - ABC News,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/outraged-letter-carriers-demand-action-stop-robberies-99172304,"Postal carriers have more worries than snow, rain or the gloom of night keeping them from their appointed rounds
PORTLAND, Maine -- Postal carriers have more worries than snow, rain or the gloom of night keeping them from their appointed rounds. They're increasingly being robbed, often at gunpoint, from Maine to California. 
Robberies of postal carriers have exploded, surging 78% to nearly 500 in 2022, according to data provided by U.S. Postal Inspection Service to The Associated Press under the Freedom of Information Act. 
Letter carriers are demanding action from the U.S. Postal Service.
“The National Association of Letter Carriers is outraged and angered by the assaults, armed robberies and even murders that America’s letter carriers increasingly face as they deliver the mail. These attacks are completely unacceptable,” said Paul Barner, the union’s executive vice president.
The Postal Service said it’s adapting and implementing new measures to address the robberies, which are taking a toll on letter carriers tasked with delivering about 162.1 million pieces of first-class mail each day.
“Every postal employee deserves to work in safety and to be free from targeting by criminals seeking to access the public’s mail,” said Michael Martel, spokesperson for the inspection service.
The robberies have more than quadrupled over a decade, the data show. Weapons were used in most of the 496 robberies, injuring 31 postal carriers, last year. One, Milwaukee letter carrier Aundre Cross, was shot to death, leading to three arrests. 
“They definitely need some type of security,” said Cross's friend, Jared Tangle. ""They need someone watching their back, so they can do their jobs safely.”
Many of these criminals are becoming more sophisticated and organized. Some are targeting the special keys that carriers use to access collection boxes and to deliver mail in apartment buildings.
A case this January north of Boston was typical. A letter carrier in Peabody was on his route when a 20-year-old man told him, “Give me your keys” and “Hurry up or I’ll shoot you” while pointing a semi-automatic handgun at the carrier, law enforcement officials said. The assailant fled but was later arrested. 
In March, a postal carrier was slashed with a machete in Lowell, Massachusetts. That assailant also was located and arrested.
The Postal Service leadership is preparing to announce more measures to address the problem, USPS spokesperson Dave Partenheimer said.
Already, the service is working to enhance collection box key and lock technology; implement dual authentication to make keys less attractive targets for criminals; and “harden” blue collection boxes to prevent tampering, while continuing to work closely with other law enforcement agencies to bring the criminals to justice, Partenheimer said.
Partenheimer added Monday that the USPS is in the process of briefing congressional committees on its responses to postal crime. 
Theft of mail carries a penalty of up to five years in prison, and possession, concealment or disposal of property carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison, Martel said. Assault carries a sentence of up to 10 years for a first offense, and up to 25 years for a subsequent offense, he said.
“We will continue to adapt to evolving security threats and implement expanded measures to safeguard our employees and preserve the security of the mail that our customers expect and deserve,” Partenheimer said.
But Barner said letter carriers “demand solutions now.” 
""While we will continue to engage with the Postal Service and relevant law enforcement agencies to develop measures that will enhance the safety of letter carriers, the fear and the danger that letter carriers are confronting has to end,"" Barner's statement said.

87,"Tyson Foods shares plunge after surprise loss, revenue forecast cut | Reuters",https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tyson-foods-cuts-2023-sales-forecast-demand-slows-2023-05-08/,"May 8 (Reuters) - Tyson Foods Inc (TSN.N) shares plunged 16% to a three-year low on Monday as the U.S. meatpacker posted a surprise second-quarter loss and cut its full-year revenue forecast amid slowing consumer demand.
The weaker-than-expected results indicate cash-strapped shoppers are cutting back on meat spending in a high-inflation environment while a shrinking cattle herd forces Tyson to pay more for livestock, eroding margins. Tyson also continues to struggle with increased expenses for staples like animal feed.
CEO Donnie King, who is seeking to cut costs, said Tyson is in the unusual position of facing challenges in its beef, pork and chicken businesses simultaneously.
The company lowered its forecast for full-year sales to $53 billion to $54 billion from $55 billion to $57 billion, after adjusted operating income for the first half of fiscal year 2023 sank 80% to $518 million.
""This quarter was definitely a tough one,"" King said on a conference call.
Tyson hiked meat prices last year to offset inflation, but average sales prices for its beef and pork fell 5.4% and 10.3%, respectively, in the quarter ending April 1. Reduced demand for beef is making it difficult for Tyson to pass on higher costs to consumers, the company said.
Sales volumes in Tyson's beef segment also fell, putting overall sales down 8.3% at $4.62 billion.
Elevated feed costs and drought have driven cattle producers to send animals to slaughter instead of keeping them for breeding, forcing meatpackers to compete to buy fewer livestock.
Tyson's costs to buy live cattle increased $305 million and its beef unit's operating margins fell to 0.2% from 12.7% a year earlier. The company pegged full-year beef margins at negative 1% to positive 1%, compared with its previous forecast of 2% to 4%.
Beef margins were Tyson's worst since 2015, while pork margins were the worst in more than two decades at negative 2.2%, JPMorgan analyst Ken Goldman said.
In Tyson's chicken business, margins were negative 3.7% as feed costs jumped by $145 million. The unit's adjusted operating income swung to a loss of $166 million from profits of $203 million a year earlier as Tyson recorded $92 million in charges related to the planned closure of two processing plants this month.
Higher chicken feed costs were a ""particular disappointment,"" Goldman said, as grain prices have moderated.
Tyson posted an overall adjusted loss of 4 cents per share, below analysts' expectations for an 80-cent profit. A year earlier, earnings were $2.29 per share.
""Many of the headwinds experienced are likely to persist for the remainder of the fiscal year,"" Chief Financial Officer John R. Tyson said.

Gas prices fell through most of the second half of 2022, increased, and then began edging downward — again.
""Michigan motorists continue to see lower prices at the pump for the third straight week,"" said Adrienne Woodland, spokeswoman for AAA, which tracks prices at about 120,000 stations nationwide. ""If demand remains low, drivers will likely see gas prices continue to decline.""
Monday's average price is 23 cents less than this time last month and 94 cents less than this time last year. Motorists are paying about $50 for a full 15-gallon tank of gasoline; about $28 less from 2022's highest price last June. The national average price is $3.54 a gallon.
Metro Detroit’s current average is $3.39 per gallon, about 9 cents less than last week’s average.
Gas demand decreased significantly from 9.51 to 8.62 million barrels a day, according to new data from the Energy Information Administration. The fall in demand is in line with what market observers expected. Total domestic gasoline stocks increased by 1.8 million barrels to 222.9 million barrels.
""In addition to gasoline prices declining, the average price of a gallon of diesel will join gasoline in the days ahead, falling below $4 per gallon in the next 48 hours or so, a sign of how far we’ve come,"" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, another group that tracks prices. ""Americans are spending hundreds of millions less on fuel every week compared to a year ago, and that’s a number that could rise further as prices are poised to continue trending lower this week.""

Lower demand, alongside an increase in stocks, has contributed to pushing pump prices lower.
West Texas Intermediate, a global oil benchmark, decreased by $3.06 a barrel to settle at $68.60. Oil prices decreased amid ongoing market concerns that rising interest rates will tip the economy into a recession. If a recession occurs, oil demand and prices will likely decline.

90,San Diego TV Station Acquired By CW Parent Nexstar For $35M – Deadline,https://deadline.com/2023/05/nexstar-cw-san-diego-tv-stations-acquired-35-million-1235359051/,"
					By Dade Hayes 
Business Editor

Nexstar Media Group, which owns The CW and the largest group of local TV stations in the U.S., is adding an independent station in San Diego to its portfolio.

	The company has agreed to pay $35 million to acquire KUSI-TV (Channel 51) from McKinnon Broadcasting Company. It will join Nexstar-owned Fox affiliate KSWB-TV in San Diego, which is the No. 30 market in the U.S.

	The move is a potential step toward creating an owned-and-operated CW station in the market. The network is currently carried by KFMB, a Tegna-owned station, and any transition would have to wait until the expiration of its affiliate agreement. Still, the upside of that scenario was noted in Nexstar’s announcement of the deal. The station combination is “expected to be accretive to Nexstar’s operating results when The CW Network affiliation becomes available in the market,” the announcement said.

	










	The San Diego shuffle comes days after eight CBS stations in major markets shed their CW affiliations to become independent, a development that had been expected since Nexstar acquired a majority stake in The CW last fall.  

	The transaction is expected to close later this year, pending FCC approval. The FCC also is continuing to evaluate Tegna’s pending sale to private equity firm Standard General, though that process has been mired in litigation since the regulatory agency opted to refer the matter to an administrative hearing.

	“KUSI-TV’s established local news operations serving viewers and advertisers across the San Diegocommunity is a perfect fit with our station group and existing San Diego operations at KSWB-TV,” Nexstar President and COO Tom Carter said in a press release. “Their mission of serving the community by delivering the most local news in the market is consistent with Nexstar’s commitment to providing consumers expansive local content on linear and digital platforms.”

	KUSI owner and CEO Mike McKinnon said the deal will create “one of the most dynamic news organizations in all of Southern California.”

NEW  YORK—The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Center for Microeconomic Data today  released the April 2023 Survey of Consumer  Expectations,  which shows that inflation expectations declined at the short-term horizon, but  increased slightly at the medium- and longer-term horizons. Labor market  expectations deteriorated slightly, with unemployment expectations and  perceived job loss risk increasing and job finding expectations decreasing. Perceptions  and expectations of credit conditions were mixed. 
The main findings  from the April 2023 Survey are:
Inflation
Labor Market
Household Finance
  
About the Survey of Consumer Expectations (SCE)

The SCE contains information about how consumers expect overall inflation  and prices for food, gas, housing, and education to behave. It also provides  insight into Americans’ views about job prospects and earnings growth and their  expectations about future spending and access to credit. The SCE also provides  measures of uncertainty regarding consumers’ outlooks. Expectations are also  available by age, geography, income, education, and numeracy. 
The SCE is a nationally representative, internet-based  survey of a rotating panel of approximately 1,300 household heads. Respondents  participate in the panel for up to 12 months, with a roughly equal number  rotating in and out of the panel each month. Unlike comparable surveys based on  repeated cross-sections with a different set of respondents in each wave, this  panel allows us to observe the changes in expectations and behavior of the same  individuals over time. For further information on the SCE, please refer to an  overview of the survey methodology here,  the interactive  chart guide, and the survey questionnaire.",1
93,Bentley production chief to lead Volkswagen's software overhaul | Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/volkswagen-name-bentley-production-chief-new-cariad-head-sources-2023-05-08/,"May 8 (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) has appointed Bentley production chief Peter Bosch to lead its software subsidiary Cariad, dismissing all but one of the unit's current executive board members as the automaker tries to get the troubled division on track.
Bosch will take over from June 1, the German group said on Monday, with two further software experts to join Cariad's board alongside him and human resources head Rainer Zugehoer, the only board member to remain in his post.
Bosch, a former Oliver Wyman consultant who spent nearly seven years at the Volkswagen brand before moving to Bentley in 2017, will also take over financial management at Cariad, Volkswagen said, confirming an earlier Handelsblatt report.
""He is a strategist, an enabler and a team player,"" Volkswagen CEO Oliver Blume said of Bosch in a statement.
Thomas Guenther, currently a senior vice president at Cariad, will fill one of the two software roles, sources told Reuters earlier on Monday, as first reported by Manager Magazin.
The company is in talks with outgoing Cariad Chief Executive Dirk Hilgenberg and his team about new roles within Volkswagen, Blume said.
The sweeping changes come as Blume conducts a strategic review of every facet of the carmaker after taking over from former leader Herbert Diess last September, who set up Cariad but failed to put it on solid footing.
Cariad is ""stepping up the pace and broadening our approach to partnerships,"" Blume said, without providing further details.
Cariad has been dogged by delays and overspending, with a new software platform intended to enable ""Level 4"" autonomous driving, due to be implemented across the fleet from 2026, pushed back to the end of the decade, sources have said.
Automakers are racing to develop competitive software-powered features from self driving to in-car entertainment that provide them with valuable data on customer behaviour and vehicle performance.
Diess bundled Volkswagen's efforts on the matter into Cariad to try to streamline development and retain control over what he believed would be the key area of innovation for cars in the future.
Blume is not planning to shift gears completely with the new leadership, sources told Reuters on Monday - but he does intend to place greater emphasis on partnerships to get the carmaker's software plans underway, rather than going at it alone.
""We will certainly make some changes, but this is not a 180-degree turn,"" one source said.

Facebook says it is not dead. Facebook also wants you to know that it is not just for ""old people,"" as young people have been saying for years.
Now, with the biggest thorn in its side — TikTok — facing heightened government scrutiny amid growing tensions between the U.S. and China, Facebook could, perhaps, position itself as a viable, domestic-bred alternative.
There's just one problem: young adults like Devin Walsh have moved on.
""I don't even remember the last time I logged in. It must have been years ago,"" said Walsh, 24, who lives in Manhattan and works in public relations.
Instead, she checks Instagram, which is also owned by Facebook parent company Meta, about five or six times a day. Then there's TikTok, of course, where she spends about an hour each day scrolling, letting the algorithm find things ""I didn't even know I was interested in.""
Walsh can't imagine a world in which Facebook, which she joined when she was in 6th grade, becomes a regular part of her life again.
""It's the branding, right? When I think of Facebook, I think ugh, like cheugy, older people, like parents posting pictures of their kids, random status updates and also people fighting about political issues,"" Walsh said, using the Gen Z term for things that are definitely not cool.
The once-cool social media platform born before the iPhone is approaching two decades in existence. For those who came of age around the time Mark Zuckerberg launched thefacebook.com from his Harvard dorm room in 2004, it's been inextricably baked into daily life — even if it's somewhat faded into the background over the years.
Facebook faces a particularly odd challenge. Today, 3 billion people check it each month. That's more than a third of the world's population. And 2 billion log in every day. Yet it still finds itself in a battle for relevancy, and its future, after two decades of existence.
For younger generations — those who signed up in middle school, or those who are now in middle school, it's decidedly not the place to be. Without this trend-setting demographic, Facebook, still the main source of revenue for parent company Meta, risks fading into the background — utilitarian but boring, like email.
It wasn't always like this. For nearly a decade, Facebook was the place to be, the cultural touchstone, the thing constantly referenced in daily conversations and late-night TV, its founding even the subject of a Hollywood movie. Rival MySpace, which launched only a year earlier, quickly became outdated as the cool kids flocked to Facebook. It didn't help MySpace's fate that it was sold to stodgy old News Corp. in 2005.
""It was this weird combination...no one knew how technology worked, but in order to have a MySpace, we all needed to become mini coders. It was so stressful."" said Moira Gaynor, 28. ""Maybe that's even why Facebook took off. Because compared to MySpace it was this beautiful, integrated, wonderful engagement area that we didn't have before and we really craved after struggling with MySpace for so long.""
Positioning himself a visionary, Zuckerberg refused to sell Facebook and pushed his company through the mobile revolution. While some rivals emerged — remember Orkut? — they generally petered out as Facebook soared, seemingly unstoppable despite scandals over user privacy and a failure to address hate speech and misinformation adequately. It reached a billion daily users in 2015.
Debra Aho Williamson, an analyst with Insider Intelligence who's followed Facebook since its early days, notes that the site's younger users have been dwindling but doesn't see Facebook going anywhere, at least not any time soon.
""The fact that we are talking about Facebook being 20 years old, I think that is a testament of what Mark developed when he was in college. It's pretty incredible,"" she said. ""It is still a very powerful platform around the world.""
AOL was once powerful too, but its user base has aged and now an aol.com email address is little more than a punchline in a joke about technologically illiterate people of a certain age.
Tom Alison, who serves as the head of Facebook (Zuckerberg's title is now Meta CEO), sounded optimistic when he outlined the platform's plans to lure in young adults in an interview with The Associated Press.
""We used to have a team at Facebook that was focused on younger cohorts, or maybe there was a project or two that was dedicated to coming up with new ideas,"" Alison said. ""And about two years ago we said no — our entire product line needs to change and evolve and adapt to the needs of the young adults.""
He calls it the era of ""social discovery.""
""It's very much motivated by what we see the next generation wanting from social media. The simple way that I like to describe it is we want Facebook to be the place where you can connect with the people you know, the people you want to know and the people that you should know,"" Alison said.
Artificial intelligence is central to this plan. Just as TikTok uses its AI and algorithm to show people videos they didn't know they wanted to see Facebook is hoping to harness its powerful technology to win back the hearts and eyeballs of young adults. Reels, the TikTok-like videos Facebook and Instagram users are bombarded with when they log into both apps, are also key. And, of course, private messaging.
""What we are seeing is more people wanting to share reels, discuss reels, and we're starting to integrate messaging features back into the app to again allow Facebook to be a place where not only do you discover great things that are relevant to you, but you share and you discuss those with people,"" Alison said.
Facebook has consistently declined to disclose user demographics, which would shed some light on how it is faring among young adults. But outside researchers say their numbers are declining. The same is true for teenagers — although Facebook seems to have stepped back from actively recruiting teens amid concerns about social media's effects on their mental health.
""Young people often shape the future of communication. I mean, that's basically how Facebook took off — young people gravitated toward it. And we we see that happening with pretty much every social platform that has come on the scene since Facebook,"" said Williamson. This year, Insider estimates that about half of TikTok's users are between the ages of 12 and 24.
Williamson doesn't see this trend reversing, but notes that Insider's estimates only go as far as 2026. There's a decline, but it's slow. That year, the research firm expects about 28% of U.S. Facebook's users to be between 18 and 34 years old, compared with nearly 46% for TikTok and 42% for Instagram. The numbers are more stark for teens aged 12-17.
""I think the best thing they could do is get away from being a social platform. Like they've lost that. But hey, if they want to become the new Yellow Pages, why not?"" said Gaynor, who lives in San Diego, California and works in government. ""I really like Marketplace. I recently just moved, so that was where I got most of my furniture.""

Blockchain company Ripple's legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is set to cost the firm around $200 million, Cointelegraph reported Monday, citing the Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse.
Garlinghouse reportedly told onlookers at the Dubai Fintech Summit that he would not advise crypto entrepreneurs to set up in the U.S., adding that the country puts politics ahead of policy.
Ripple, along with several of its executives, was sued by the securities regulator in 2020 over the unregistered sale of XRP tokens worth around $1.3 billion. The same year, the firm opened its regional headquarters in Dubai.
Since the collapse of crypto exchange FTX last year, the SEC has cracked down on some of the biggest players in the industry over violations of federal securities laws – although it recently pulled back from officially defining ""digital assets.""
Ripple has historically kept its distance from XRP, which powers some of Ripple’s products.
A judgement on the SEC case is expected in the next three to six weeks, according to the report. Hopes that the lawsuit would go in Ripple's favor caused the XRP token price to surge in March.

            PDF          


DEERFIELD Ill. and BOSTON and NEW YORK -
              2023-05-08


Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX), a leading global medtech company, today announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to divest its BioPharma Solutions (“BPS”) business to Advent International (“Advent”), one of the largest and most experienced global private equity investors, and Warburg Pincus, a leading global growth investor. 
Under the terms of the definitive agreement, Baxter will receive $4.25 billion in cash, subject to certain closing adjustments, with net after-tax proceeds currently estimated to be approximately $3.4 billion. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2023, subject to receipt of customary regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. Baxter intends to utilize the after-tax proceeds to reduce its debt, consistent with the company’s stated capital allocation priorities. For the full fourth quarter 2023, Baxter estimates the transaction to result in dilution of approximately $0.10 per share to the company’s earnings, the total amount depending on the time of close. This amount is expected to be partially offset through reduced interest expense payments following anticipated debt repayment.
“Today represents an important step in Baxter’s ongoing transformation journey as we continue to execute against our strategic priorities, enhance our focus and create additional value for all our stakeholders,” said José (Joe) E. Almeida, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer at Baxter. “BPS has long been recognized worldwide as a trusted and preferred partner of contract manufacturing services for the pharmaceutical and biotech industries. Advent International and Warburg Pincus have extensive experience helping innovative healthcare companies advance their mission and strategic priorities. I am confident that under their stewardship, BPS will continue to build on its leadership position, foster world-class talent, invest in new capabilities and capacity, and provide leading-edge, high-quality solutions for its clients.”
BPS has been a leading provider of sterile contract manufacturing solutions, parenteral delivery systems and customized support services to the pharma and biotech industries for decades. As a standalone company and in partnership with Advent and Warburg Pincus, BPS will operate as a premier, independent end-to-end CDMO providing a range of services for clients, from clinical research to commercial deployment. BPS should be well-positioned to accelerate its go-to-market strategy and clinical development pipeline, execute on throughput expansion and drive further product innovation. The proposed transaction includes BPS manufacturing facilities and approximately 1,700 employees in Bloomington, Indiana and Halle, Germany. BPS is expected to generate revenues of approximately $600 million on a reported basis for full year 2023.
“BPS is a premier asset at the forefront of the biopharma industry, and one we’ve been closely following for a number of years,” said John Maldonado, a Managing Partner at Advent. “Leveraging our deep sector expertise and significant strategic resources, we believe this partnership can unlock multiple opportunities for growth and help the business realize its full potential by serving blue-chip customers, including Baxter, with high-value, specialized and end-to-end capabilities as a standalone company. We're thrilled to partner with BPS to alleviate critical pain points for its customers and to help them provide life-changing therapies to patients around the world.” 
“BPS’s success and exceptional market reputation within the pharmaceutical sector position the company well to continue to grow its mission-critical services across a variety of therapeutic areas including oncology, metabolic disease, and infectious disease, among others,” said TJ Carella, Managing Director and Head of Healthcare at Warburg Pincus. “We are excited to partner with Advent and the impressive team at BPS who have developed differentiated technical capabilities and established an industry-leading reputation for quality and reliability in the supply chain for parenteral drugs.”
“We strongly believe in the company’s mission to partner with pharmaceutical companies around the world to provide the scientific expertise, sterile solutions, and customized support needed to meet the unique challenges of today’s healthcare environment and are eager to carry forward the strong franchise and legacy that Baxter has built at BPS,” added Ruoxi Chen, Managing Director at Warburg Pincus. “This investment underscores our commitment to working with companies that support the delivery of innovative life sciences products and services worldwide.”
“BPS has an exceptional track record of delivering high-quality services and products addressing the unique needs of pharmaceutical and biotech customers worldwide,” said Carmine Petrone, a Managing Director on Advent’s Healthcare team. “We believe that, alongside our partners at Warburg Pincus, our collective carve out experience, vision and support will help create a scaled, diversified platform poised to capitalize on its significant market opportunity. We look forward to supporting BPS’s continued growth as it enhances its positive impact on patients worldwide and continues to help its customers achieve their commercialization objectives.”

100,COVID test recall: FDA warns of bacterial contamination in some Pilot COVID-19 At-Home Tests from Roche and SD Biosensor - CBS Minnesota,https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/covid-tests-recall-bacteria-fda-roche-biosensor/,"Watch CBS News

More than a half million home COVID-19 tests from Roche and SD Biosensor should be thrown out immediately, the Food and Drug Administration is warning, citing ""significant concerns"" over bacteria that could infect users of the tests.
The FDA says the recalled ""Pilot COVID-19 At-Home Tests"" can be identified by lot numbers listed on this page. 500,000 were distributed to CVS and 16,000 to Amazon.
None of the potentially contaminated kits were distributed through the federal government's testing programs like COVID.gov/tests, the FDA says.
""SD Biosensor Inc., the manufacturer of the Pilot COVID-19 At-Home Test, informed Roche that this issue was identified during routine quality assurance testing. Potentially harmful bacteria were found in the liquid buffer solution,"" Roche said in a statement.
The FDA says bacteria discovered in liquid tubes that come with the test kits include Enterococcus, Enterobacter, Klebsiella and Serratia, which can lead to potentially dangerous infections, especially in people with compromised immune systems.
So far, the FDA says it has not received any reports of injuries or deaths linked to contaminated tests. 
The agency also warns that people who have already used the tests may have gotten false positive or false negative results.
Roche and SD Biosensor said they have worked with distributors and retailers to quarantine lots of the tests while their investigation continues, and are cooperating with the FDA.
Evie Baik, a spokesperson for SD Biosensor, said in a statement that their probe has identified raw materials from one of their suppliers as the likely culprit.
The company is ramping up their quality control efforts, Baik said, in hopes of rooting out further contaminated batches before distribution. SD Biosensor also cut off the supplier behind the contamination.
""To date, no such illness has been reported and to date no impact on performance has been confirmed,"" Baik said.

101,"Why it can be hard to find a Tesla, Rivian, GM, or Ford electric vehicle near you - Vox",https://www.vox.com/technology/23713040/ev-car-dealer-dealership-electric-sales-gm-ford-tesla-rivian,"A new survey finds two-thirds of car dealers didn’t have a single electric vehicle for sale.
Electric cars and trucks are more popular than ever, and sales are growing, but if you want one, you’ll probably have a hard time finding an EV in stock near you. 
Two-thirds of US car dealers surveyed in a new Sierra Club study, published Monday, didn’t have any battery electric or plug-in hybrids for sale in 2022, new or used. 
“There are more dealerships that have electric vehicles since the last time we did this report [in 2019], but it’s still shockingly low,” said Katherine García, director of the Clean Transportation for All Campaign at the Sierra Club. 
Transportation is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the US, with passenger cars and trucks making up 57 percent of this share. So electrifying sedans, SUVs, and pickups is an essential component of the strategy for meeting climate change targets. The US has committed to cutting its total emissions in half from 2005 levels by 2030. Meanwhile, automakers like General Motors have committed to going all-electric, and there are looming bans on fossil fuel-powered cars in some of the largest car-buying states like California and New York.

So what’s the holdup?
A big part of it is due to supply chain blockages, with shortfalls in semiconductor and battery production preventing manufacturers from making enough electrics to meet demand. Some of the largest carmakers in the world — Honda, Toyota, Stellantis — had few if any EVs and plug-in hybrid models at all for sale in North America last year. According to the Sierra Club survey, 44 percent of car dealers who didn’t have an EV on their lots would gladly sell them if they could get their hands on one. 
“The larger bottleneck is with the manufacturers themselves,” García said. 
But 45 percent of dealers without EVs said they wouldn’t sell them even if they were available. The structure of the car sales model can put dealers, manufacturers, and customers at odds since the economics of EVs can disrupt the business model for dealerships. It’s another critical choke point: If a dealer is resistant to stocking electric cars and trucks, a buyer might not have any nearby options for the specific EV they want since manufacturers grant dealers monopolies in a given area. 
With the rise of all-electric carmakers like Tesla and Rivian, however, there’s a push for car companies to sell their vehicles directly to customers without the middleman. It’s forcing major auto companies and dealers to adapt and it will chart the route ahead for zero-emissions cars and trucks.
The EV buying experience varies a lot depending on what kind of car you’re looking for and where you are. Ninety percent of Mercedes-Benz dealers had an EV for sale compared to 11 percent of Honda retailers, according to the Sierra Club study. This includes used vehicles for sale that were made by another manufacturer.
Your best bet for finding an EV on the lot was in the southeastern US in states like Georgia and Florida, where 41 percent of dealers had an electric for sale. In Western states like California, Oregon, and Washington, only 27 percent of dealers had EVs in stock. This region also accounted for 45 percent of EV sales in the US, so the lower stock was likely due to more demand.
Some manufacturers are racing to keep up while also coping with recalls. Dealers in turn are adjusting to these sporadic supplies, but also trying to accommodate how EVs are changing the way they do business. 
All states have rules that encourage or require carmakers to sell vehicles to customers through dealerships. There are close to 17,000 franchise new car dealers in the US, and they sold 13.7 million light-duty vehicles last year, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association. 
Originally, these regulations were designed to prevent a handful of major car companies from colluding across the country and fixing prices. Dealers also expanded the footprint of carmakers and gave buyers a local point of contact. They’re technically independent franchises, which means that they can set their own prices and incentives, but carmakers have a lot of leverage in how dealerships function. 
Vivek Astvansh, an assistant professor of marketing at Indiana University, explained that car dealers have three main functions: They sell cars and take trade-ins on behalf of the manufacturer, they provide loans to buyers, and they perform maintenance and repairs.
It turns out that parts and service can account for nearly half of a dealership’s profits. But EVs don’t need oil changes, spark plugs, or valve checks. “All else equal, an electric car has fewer mechanical parts than a gasoline or diesel car, which directly means that the revenue a car dealer makes from an electric car is much lower than what the dealer will make from a gas or diesel counterpart,” said Astvansh.  
If there are any issues or recalls, many fixes for EVs can be applied over the air rather than going to a dealer. It’s a selling point for an EV buyer but a challenge for a dealer. “That is why they are hesitant to make a strong case for electric cars,” Astvansh said. 
On the other hand, many people are buying EVs for the first time and they’re counting on dealers to teach them the ins and outs of charging, maximizing range, and taking advantage of government incentives. As cars have become less mechanical, they’ve become more computerized, creating a learning curve for first-time drivers who may not appreciate the importance of keeping their car’s software updated, for example.  
“The foremost function that a dealer can provide is that of educating the buyers,” Astvansh said. “Customers cannot just use ChatGPT or Google and have all the information. They need to interact with a human being.” 
But dealers have to make investments in their infrastructure to sell EVs. Ford has created an EV certification program for its dealers, which requires them to build fast chargers and train their staff to work on electrics. The top-tier certification can cost a dealership up to $1.2 million to achieve, but it gives them first crack at new EVs and allocates them more inventory. Ford said that more than half of Ford dealers in the US have signed on as the company aims to build its own EV charging network.

“It’s good for Ford; it’s just that the initial investment is expensive,” said Devron Stevenson, general manager of Banister Ford of Marlow Heights in Maryland. Stevenson said his dealership is gearing up to install level 3 fast chargers this year that can top up an EV in minutes, but require dedicated grid connections and specialized electrical hardware.  
Similarly, General Motors, the parent company of Chevrolet, is enacting standards for dealers. “For EVs, dealers must maintain the proper service tools, battery charging equipment, and training, as well as meeting customer experience standards,” said David Caldwell, a spokesperson for GM. “More than 90 percent of Chevrolet dealers are enrolled.”
But even if manufacturers build them and dealers sell them, the trickier question is whether enough people will buy electric cars and trucks to make this all worthwhile. With borrowing costs increasing, EVs are a tougher sell since on average they have a higher sticker price than their fossil fuel counterparts. Earlier this month, Ford announced a price cut of up to 8 percent on its Mustang Mach-E. For dealers, how much they invest in EV infrastructure now is a delicate balancing act. “It’s going to depend: How fast can we get them? Can we afford them? Does it make sense overall in the next 24 months? To me, it’s a bit of a toss-up,” Stevenson said.  
Dealer franchise laws across the US benefit existing dealers but pose a problem for manufacturers that want to sell directly to their customers in some states. Tesla operates a factory in Texas, but the company can’t sell its cars to Texans directly. The cars have to be shipped out of the state before delivery to a Texas buyer. 
Other EV-only carmakers like Rivian and Lucid also sell directly to consumers. This doesn’t factor into the Sierra Club’s calculations, so EVs are more accessible to more people than the number of cars on lots lets on. 
EV companies say that this direct-to-consumer model lets them elide the haggling of traditional car dealers and avoid the costs of maintaining dealer lots and sales staff. Twenty-three states now allow direct sales for EV-only auto companies, though they they still face restrictions in many cases. Several more states are working on laws to make direct sales easier, either by relaxing rules or granting EV makers dealer licenses. 
Conventional automakers like Ford and Volkswagen have recently started to echo this, letting customers buy cars online and pick them up at a dealer rather than going through the sales process in person. 
Yet even EVs need to have their tires rotated, and all-electric companies are rushing to build out service centers to handle maintenance and recalls, or leaning on traditional automakers. “How important is convenient local service to customers? Since 2021, Tesla owners have come to GM dealerships for service on more than 11,000 occasions,” Caldwell said. 
He added that while EVs may not yet be available everywhere, the auto industry is making the largest and fastest technological change in its history. In 2020, electric cars and trucks accounted for 4.2 percent of new vehicle sales worldwide. In 2021, 8.3 percent. Last year, 14 percent.
“Two words: It’s happening,” Caldwell said.

103,"German industrial output slumps, recession fears rise | Reuters",https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/german-industrial-output-drops-34-march-2023-05-08/,"BERLIN, May 8 (Reuters) - German industrial production fell more than expected in March, partly due to a weak performance by the automotive sector, spurring again recession fears in Europe's largest economy.
Production decreased by 3.4% on the previous month following a slightly revised increase of 2.1% in February, the federal statistical office said on Monday. In a Reuters poll, analysts had pointed to a 1.3% fall.
""After a buoyant performance by industrial production at the beginning of the year, there was an unexpectedly sharp decline in March,"" the economics ministry said.
The manufacture of motor vehicles and automotive parts fell by 6.5% on the previous month. Production in machinery and equipment fell by 3.4% and output in the construction sector decreased by 4.6% on the month.
In the first quarter, production was 2.5% higher than in the last quarter of 2022, according to the statistics office.
In March, German industrial orders fell by 10.7% from the previous month on a seasonally and calendar adjusted basis, posting the largest month-on-month decline since 2020 at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.
""German manufacturing is suffering more and more from the global rate hikes, which are increasingly applying the brakes on the economy,"" said Commerzbank's chief economist Ralph Solveen. ""The risks of a recession in Germany are rising.""
Retail sales and exports also dropped sharply in March, increasing the odds of a downward revision to first-quarter gross domestic product, ING's global head of macro Carsten Brzeski said.
GDP was unchanged quarter on quarter in adjusted terms in the first quarter, following a 0.5% contraction in the fourth quarter of 2022. A recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction.
""A downward revision would mean the economy fell into recession after all,"" Brzeski said.

Pepecoin (PEPE) holders may be taking profits on their positions following one of the most spectacular rises in the history of alternative currencies (altcoins) with an almost 5,000,000% rise in the past few weeks.
The tokens are down nearly 45% after setting a peak of $0.00000431 on Friday, reaching a market capitalization of $1.8 billion just over three weeks since issuance in mid-April.
This price drop was likely exacerbated by traders taking profits on their positions or utilizing advanced trading strategies following the introduction of several pepe-tracked futures in the past week.
These profits are likely being converted into ether (ETH), which hit an all-time high in deposits to exchanges since November 2021, when it set a lifetime high of $4,500 at the time.
As per a Monday tweet, on-chain analytics firm Santiment stated that the increasing number of ether deposits could be stemming from traders taking profits on their pepe positions.
“Exchange addresses interacting on the network is now at its highest level since November, 2021. As expected, $ETH is showing decoupling signs and on the cusp of breaking $2k once again,” Santiment said.
As such, some traders have converted mere pittances into generational fortunes in the span of a few days after investing in pepe coins right after their issuance.
As CoinDesk previously reported, a pseudonymous trader named dimethyltryptamine.eth spent $263 just three weeks ago to buy trillions of PEPE tokens, selling a part of the holdings for over $3.8 million in profits. The trader continues to hold over $5 million worth of the tokens as of Monday.
Such meteoric fortunes aren’t the norm, however: Analysts have repeatedly raised concerns about the behavior of investors who bought relatively large amounts of PEPE after its issuance on the Ethereum blockchain – opening the risk of too much of the coin in too few hands looming over the short-term future of the trending meme coin.

105,Oil climbs over 2% as recession fears begin to fade | Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/oil-prices-inch-up-recession-fears-begin-fade-2023-05-08/,"SINGAPORE, May 8 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose over 2% on Monday as U.S. recession fears eased and some traders saw crude's three-week slide on demand worries as overdone.
Brent crude settled up $1.71, or 2.3%, at $77.01. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude also gained $1.82, or 2.6%, to $73.16.
A healthy U.S. jobs report for April helped oil to climb by about 4% on Friday even though labour market strength could compel the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates higher for longer.
Brent had finished last week with a decline of about 5.3% while U.S. crude plunged by 7.1% even after Friday's rebound. Both benchmarks were down for three weeks in a row for the first time since November.
""Oil's rebound (on Monday) follows energy stocks' comeback on Wall Street last Friday after the U.S. reported strong job data, which eased concerns about an imminent economic recession,"" said CMC Markets analyst Tina Teng.
Banking concerns have plagued the market recently after the collapse of three major U.S. regional banks in recent months. Still, the KBW Regional Banking index (.KRX) posted its best single-day performance in seven weeks on Friday, before falling on Monday.
""The market is less worried about a banking crisis that could lead to a recession and hurt demand,"" said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group.
Also supporting oil prices, Alberta declared a state of emergency over the weekend in response to wildfires that have displaced nearly 30,000 people and prompted energy producers to shut in at least 185,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), about 2% of Canada's output.
Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said oil's recent drop looked excessive.
""An oversold market condition combined with Brent managing to find support ahead of the March low forced recently established short sellers to seek cover, potentially highlighting that the recent sell-off was overdone,"" he said.
Goldman Sachs analysts on Saturday said that concerns over near-term demand and elevated supplies were ""overblown.""
A round of voluntary output cuts by some members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, together called OPEC+, begin this month and the group holds its next meeting on June 4.
Before then, U.S. consumer price inflation figures for April will be in focus on Wednesday, potentially influencing the Fed's stance on future interest rate decisions.
OPEC's latest monthly oil market report is due on Thursday, providing an updated reading on the demand and supply outlook.

106,The jobs AI won't take yet - BBC Worklife,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20230507-the-jobs-ai-wont-take-yet,"
What is Worklife?
How We Work
How We Live
How We Think

Since the start of the industrial revolution, there have been threats that new machines – from mechanized looms to microchips – would usurp human jobs. For the most part, the humans have prevailed. Now, say some experts, with AI ubiquity on the horizon, the threat’s being realized: the robots really are coming for some jobs.
A March 2023 report from Goldman Sachs estimated that AI capable of content generation could do a quarter of all the work currently done by humans. Across the European Union and US, the report further notes, 300 million jobs could be lost to automation. And that could be dire, says Martin Ford, author of Rule of the Robots: How Artificial Intelligence Will Transform Everything.
“It's not just that this would happen to individuals, but it could be pretty systemic,” he says. “It could happen to a lot of people, potentially quite suddenly, potentially all at the same time. And that has implications not just for those individuals, but for the whole economy.”
Thankfully, it’s not all bad news. The experts issue their warnings with a caveat: there are still things AI isn’t capable of – tasks that involve distinctly human qualities, like emotional intelligence and outside-the-box thinking. And moving into roles that centre those skills could help lessen the chances of being replaced.
“I think there are generally three categories that are going to be relatively insulated in the foreseeable future,” says Ford. “The first would be jobs that are genuinely creative: you’re not doing formulaic work or just rearranging things, but you're genuinely coming up with new ideas and building something new.”

That doesn’t necessarily mean all jobs that are considered ‘creative’ are safe. In fact, things like graphic design and visual art-related roles may be among the first to go; basic algorithms can direct a bot to analyse millions of images, allowing AI to master aesthetics instantly. But there’s some security in other kinds of creativity, says Ford: “in science, and medicine and law … people whose job is coming up with a new legal strategy or business strategy. I think that there's going to continue to be a place there for human beings”. 
The second insulated category, he continues, is jobs that require sophisticated interpersonal relationships. He points to nurses, business consultants and investigative journalists. These are jobs, he says, “where you need a very deep understanding of people. I think it’ll be a long time before AI has the ability to interact in the kinds of ways that really build relationships”.
The third safe zone, says Ford, “are jobs that really require lots of mobility and dexterity and problem-solving ability in unpredictable environments”. Many trade jobs – think electricians, plumbers, welders and the like – fall under this umbrella. “These are the kinds of jobs where you're dealing with a new situation all the time,” he adds. “They are probably the hardest of anything to automate. In order to automate jobs like this, you would need a science fiction robot. You’d need Star Wars’s C-3PO.”
While humans will likely remain in jobs that fall within those categories, that doesn’t mean those professions are totally insulated from the ascent of AI. In fact, says Joanne Song McLaughlin, associate professor of labour economics at the University of Buffalo, US, most jobs, regardless of industry, have aspects that are likely to be automated by the technology.
“In many cases, there’s no immediate threat to jobs,” she says, “but tasks will change.” Human jobs will become more focused on interpersonal skills, continues Song McLaughlin. “It’s easy to imagine that, for instance, AI will detect cancers way better than humans could. In the future, I’m assuming doctors will use that new technology. But I don’t think the doctor’s whole role will be replaced.”

While a robot may ostensibly do a better job of finding cancer, she says, most people will still want a doctor – a real person – to be the one to tell them about it. That’s true of almost all jobs, she adds, and so developing those distinctly human skills could help people learn to do their jobs alongside AI.
“I think it’s smart to really think, ‘what kind of tasks within my job will be replaced, or will be better done by computer or AI? And what's my complementary skill?’” She points to bank tellers, who once had to be very accurate money counters. Now, that task has been automated – but there’s still a place for the teller.  “The task of money counting became obsolete because of a machine,” she says. “But now, the tellers are more focused on connecting with customers and introducing new products. The social skill has become more important.” 
It’s important to note, says Ford, that an advanced education or a high-paying position is not a defence against AI takeover. “We might think the person in the white-collar job is higher on the food chain than someone who drives a car for a living,” he says. “But the white-collar employee’s future is more threatened by the Uber driver, because we still don’t have self-driving cars, but AI can certainly write reports. In many cases, more educated workers are going to be more threatened than then even the least educated workers. Think of the person that works cleaning hotel rooms – it's really hard to automate that job.” 
In short, seeking roles in dynamic, shifting environments that include unpredictable tasks is good way to stave off job loss to AI. At least, for a while.",1
107,‘Is it worth it?’ Victim of stolen car has message for thieves,https://www.fox17online.com/news/local-news/kent/is-it-worth-it-stolen-car-victim-has-message-for-thieves,"Menu
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. — Michigan State Police is now providing wheel locks as a new, proactive approach to preventing car thefts.
This comes as hundreds of Kia and Hyundai vehicles have been stolen throughout West Michigan.
FOX 17 talked with Mallory Karazewski who dealt with car theft firsthand.
“I don’t understand the thought process of why people would want to steal people’s cars just for fun, just to joy ride and for them to just, to trash them,” she said.
Karazewski is the proud owner of a 2019 Kia— the first new car she has ever owned.
“I like that one the best. I was like this is actually a really spacious car for the size of it,” she said.
After getting the car, Karazewski started hearing about the thefts throughout West Michigan. Then she became part of the statistics.
“There was points where I would wake up two or three times throughout the night and check to make sure my car was still out there,” Karazewski added.
The Kent County Sheriff’s Office says it investigated 415 stolen vehicles in 2022— 112 of those were either a Kia or a Hyundai.
The most recent numbers show the sheriff’s office has investigated 109 stolen vehicles so far in 2023 with 24 of those being Kias and Hyundais.
Karazewski says someone broke into her car and took it for an hours-long joy ride. She got it back but not without damage.
“The front end and part of the grill are smashed out on the passenger side. There is part of the bumpers all smashed out. The whole side, passenger side, is sideswiped down it. There’s some scuffs on the other side of the back bumper. The plastic that covers the wheel, like, inside is ripped off the bumpers,” she explained. ""The ignition is obviously tore apart because that's how they get it home...smashed beer cans in the back.""
Now, she’s without a car as deputies try to figure out who stole it.
“I had just got the letter in the mail about the software update and was planning on taking it to the Kia dealership that day to have the update done because it was my first day off because I work six, seven days a week.”
Michigan State Police says it partnered with Hyundai Motor America so it will provide wheel locks to any Hyundai owner who wants one.

The actor who plays Tom Wambsgans spoke on the show's podcast about the breaking point in episode seven of the final season.

							By 

	Jackie Strause

Managing Editor, East Coast

[This story contains spoilers for the seventh episode of Succession season four, “Tailgate Party.”]

	With three episodes left in the series, Succession ended its latest episode with a major blowup. 



	After dancing a strategic waltz around the status of their relationship all season long, Shiv Roy (Sarah Snook) and Tom Wambsgans (Matthew Macfadyen) finally decided to confront one another and clear the air. Shiv, who hasn’t yet told her estranged husband that she is pregnant (likely with his baby), provoked Tom to air out all of his grievances while the pair were co-hosting the Election Eve tailgate party during the seventh episode of the HBO drama’s final season.

	“Tailgate Party” followed an episode that had suggested the pair were pausing their divorce and rekindling — director Lorene Scafaria told The Hollywood Reporter last week of their honest conversation in “Living+”: “Their love is messed up. There’s something pure, but it’s messed up. … And it kind of does bring them together and make him the right man for her, in a way.” But this week, the Shiv-Tom whiplash continued and ended on a new low. The episode began with Tom complaining about being so tired from their late-night sexcapades (with explicit text messages to prove it) and ended with the pair having a knock-down, drag-out fight outside of their Manhattan apartment for their crowd of elite media guests inside to witness.

	“It was deliciously set because we’re on the balcony of our apartment and everybody is inside looking at us in this pre-Election party. So it’s sort of awful. They can’t hear it exactly, but they can see we’re having a screaming match. So that added a wonderful layer to it,” said Macfadyen, speaking after the episode on the official Succession podcast, unpacking the conversation that can never be taken back.

	The co-hosts of the Election Eve soirée took to their balcony to confront Shiv suggesting Tom will be fired when Lukas Matsson’s (Alexander Skarsgård) GoJo acquires Waystar Royco, and everything else that has been bubbling under the surface of their marriage. The conversation saw them each hurl both insults and truths at one another, with Tom telling Shiv she is “incapable of love and maybe not a good person to have children,” and Shiv telling Tom, “I don’t like you; I don’t even care about you” when Tom calls her broken for never getting her father, Logan Roy’s (Brian Cox), approval. 

	










	The episode ended with each of them sleeping alone in their shared apartment, with an expression that left much to be desired as a sleepless Tom stared at the ceiling.

	“It’s just the fucking injustice that he feels,” explains Macfadyen of what caused Tom to explode. “He thought maybe they were in a good place and he realizes she spent the whole party, when they were supposed to be throwing it together, sort of telling everybody he was heading for the chop. So, something breaks.”

	Creator Jesse Armstrong and the writers have brought Macfadyen and Snook several meaty scenes to chew on as scene partners in this fourth and final season of the Emmy-winning saga. But Macfadyen tells journalist and host Kara Swisher, “Nothing like this. The lid has not come off in this way.”

	He continues, “It just comes to a head. The facade goes and he can’t accept it. I remember in the scene feeling the terrible rage at the injustice of it. He spends a lot of the time being diplomatic and politick and swallowing his tongue and letting her win and letting her have the last word, and maybe he doesn’t this time.”

	Macfadyen feels that Tom is less damaged than Shiv, simply because she’s a child who has suffered under Logan Roy. “They don’t feel loved by either of their parents, so maybe you can’t love yourself or you can’t love anybody else and you don’t have a real confidence. And I don’t think that’s true of Tom, necessarily,” he says.

	He agrees, however, with some of Shiv’s charges against Tom. Namely, that he only married her because of her DNA. But he also thinks they met at the right time.

	










	“I think [it was] partly attraction to her surname and her father and the business and all that stuff,” he says. “I think there was a strong sexual attraction, and they had a laugh. And we decided she was in a very, very bad way when they met. She’d come out of an awful, heartbreaking relationship and he was there to pick up the pieces and he was just a safe pair of hands. And he quite liked playing that role.”

	Macfadyen feels that, at this point, Tom is a “precarious” character because of how desperate he is, now faced with not only losing his job but also his status among the Roy family: “He’s treading water. His heart rate is racing and he’s sort of under … he’s sinking a little bit.”

	Skarsgård, meanwhile, spoke to The Hollywood Reporter about wedging his character between Shiv and Tom, but mainly between Shiv and brothers Kendall (Jeremy Strong) and Roman (Kieran Culkin). “He’s one hundred percent using her,” he said of Lukas. “He smells blood in the water, this friction between the siblings. He smells the opening. He does move fast and break things, but he can read people. He sees that in Shiv, and he goes after that. It’s worked. She’s let him in. Where we’re at now, he’s still feeling the waters and testing her out. Is she also a charlatan? Is she just like her siblings, a little Nepo Baby, or does she have what it takes? That’s what he’s trying to figure out.”

Kevin Costner’s estranged wife, Christine Baumgartner, was reportedly “unhappy” with his work schedule prior to her filing for divorce last week.
“Christine wants them to spend family time at their Santa Barbara home,” a source close to the family told People on Monday amid their split.
“During filming, Kevin is not around very much. His absence has been very hard for her.”
Despite knowing that his wife was unhappy, the insider claimed the actor was “obsessed” with directing, producing and starring in his upcoming film, “Horizon” — which took place in southern Utah from August through November 2022.
“She wasn’t happy about it,” the source simply said.
Another source in the entertainment industry told the outlet that Costner’s career has occasionally “taken precedence over his home life.”
“Kevin hasn’t been home very much for quite some time due to filming, the popularity of ‘Yellowstone,’ and the time necessary for his other projects. He has been in demand,” the source said, referring to Costner’s leading role in the hit Western drama series.

The insider admitted that the “Bodyguard” actor’s “success and excitement over the new project probably took his attention away from his family more than he realized. “
“Since it didn’t look like that would change and likely could get worse, it caused tension at home,” the source concluded.
Last week, Baumgartner, 49, filed for divorce from her estranged husband after 18 years of marriage, citing “irreconcilable differences.”
A source then told Page Six that Costner, 68, was “very surprised” when she filed.
“He obviously doesn’t want the divorce, and he would take her back,” the insider spilled and added that he still “loves [Baumgartner] and he loves his children.”
The exes share three children together — Cayden, 16, Hayes, 14, and Grace, 12 – and each parent requested for joint custody.
Since then, Baumgartner has been photographed out and about without her wedding ring and alongside daughter Grace.
Costner has kept a low profile since news of the split broke, but he was spotted wearing his wedding ring and smiling with two women just one day before his wife filed.
Shortly after her filing, Paramount announced that “Yellowstone” would be canceled after its upcoming fifth season.

                                    If she had recorded her songs just a few years later, Connie Converse might very likely be a household name to this day, writes Howard Fishman in the New York Times. Instead, she's an enigmatic footnote in modern music history, though interest appears to be growing in her legacy. Converse lived in New York City from 1945 through the '50s, mostly in its bohemian neighborhoods, working a day job while writing and recording her own songs. She even scored a TV appearance in 1954 with Walter Cronkite on CBS' The Morning Show, but her musical career never quite clicked. Her songs were seen as ""lovely, but not commercial,"" she herself put it in a letter to her brother at the time. She left New York in 1961, ironically just as Bob Dylan arrived and as the folk scene of Greenwich Village took off.
                                

                                    ""She was the female Bob Dylan,"" folk music scholar Ellen Stekert tells Fishman, who's working on a book about Converse. ""She was even better than him, as a lyricist and composer, but she didn't have his showbiz savvy, and she wasn't interested in writing protest songs."" Converse is known today mostly because NYU student Dan Dzula stumbled upon a bootleg recording from 1954 and, with a friend, assembled a 2009 album. After leaving New York, Converse went to Ann Arbor, Michigan, ""where she reinvented herself as an editor, a scholar, and an activist,"" per Fishman. And in 1974, just after her 50th birthday, she vanished without a trace. (Read the full story, which calls her ""a pioneer of what's become known as the singer-songwriter era."")

114,King Charles III and Queen Camilla pose for official royal portraits,https://nypost.com/2023/05/08/king-charles-iii-and-queen-camilla-pose-for-official-royal-portraits/,"
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	
These portraits are fit for a king and queen.
The official coronation photos of King Charles III and Queen Camilla were revealed Monday and showed the new leaders of the Commonwealth in their finest regalia.
But two royals were notably missing from the portrait session: Prince Harry and Prince Andrew.
Hugo Burnand, who took Charles and Camilla’s wedding photos in 2005, snapped the pictures immediately after the 74-year-old monarch was officially crowned at Westminster Abbey on May 6, reports the BBC.
Dressed in the Robe of Estate and wearing the Imperial State Crown, Charles looked regal in Buckingham Palace’s Throne Room. 
The new monarch is captured holding the Sovereign’s Orb and Sovereign’s Scepter with Cross in his often-mocked “sausage” fingers. 
In the photo, Charles is seen sitting on one of the thrones that was built for the1902 coronation of King Edward VII.
Camilla, 75, was photographed in the palace’s Green Drawing Room wearing Queen Mary’s crown and robe.
Burnand, 59, also released a group photo of all the senior royal members including Prince William, 40, and Kate Middleton, 41; Princess Anne and Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence; the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester; Prince Edward and Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh; and Princess Alexandra. 
Notably missing from the photo were disgraced Prince Andrew and Prince Harry, who attended his father’s coronation but immediately left the UK to return to Los Angeles after the ceremony. 
The unveiling of the portraits concluded the three-day celebration in the UK, which included a star-studded concert on Sunday featuring acts such as Lionel Richie, Katy Perry, Nicole Scherzinger and a reunion of British boyband Take That. 
Charles and his wife issued a statement offering their “most sincere and heartfelt thanks” to those who helped make the coronation weekend “such a special occasion.”
“To know that we have your support and encouragement, and to witness your kindness expressed in so many different ways, has been the greatest possible coronation gift,” the statement said. 
The king and queen also promised to rededicate their lives to “serving the people of the United Kingdom, the Realms and Commonwealth.”",1
116,Seth Rogen's beloved dog Zelda has died | CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/08/entertainment/seth-rogen-dog-died/index.html,"
      Seth Rogen and Lauren Miller-Rogen have lost their beloved dog, Zelda, who they have always said was their child. 
  

      Zelda had multitudes of fans and even appeared in a number of Rogen’s movies. 
  

      Miller-Rogen took to Instagram with the sad news, posting a carousel of pictures of the pooch, and writing a long caption about why Zelda was so special. 
  

      “We said goodbye to our perfect girl Zelda on Thursday, May 4th. She was almost 14 years old,” she wrote. “She was truly the most special, magical creature. She taught us about love, resilience, strength and kindness. We loved her more than words can describe. Everyone who met her saw what a unique little puppy she was. She’d stare in to your soul with her gigantic buggy eyes. She was so judgmental, that when she loved you, you really knew you earned it, and it made you feel like you had won.”
  

      She continued: “She had an incredible life and was lucky to have so many friends and shared her special love with so many people. She was a girl who was so shy no one adopted her as a baby who became a girl who traveled to multiple countries, appeared in three movies, on two magazine covers, and inspired countless works of Zelda-art— including a lighter that is now in the homes of hundreds of people.”
  

      Miller-Rogen also included a list of things about Zelda that stood out including “Her big eyeballs and her intense eye contact” as well as  “The way the fur on her legs looks like culottes from the back.”
  

      “The way she would sit and wait to be called to walk through the metal detectors at the airport and then she’d run through them and everyone would comment about what a good girl she was,” Miller-Rogen wrote. 
  

      Rogen shared the same post on his own Instagram.

117,Shakira spotted with Tom Cruise after seemingly slamming ex Gerard Piqué in Woman of the Year speech,https://news.yahoo.com/shakira-spotted-tom-cruise-seemingly-183831983.html,"A month after moving to Miami, Shakira is immersing herself in the city's culture, getting in on the action of Miami's Grand Prix.
The ""Hips Don't Lie"" singer did not enjoy the festivities solo, however, as she was spotted mingling with actor Tom Cruise throughout the day on Sunday.
Hidden behind massive sunglasses, the Colombian singer and ""Mission Impossible"" actor walked below the thousands of attendees in the stands, and briefly posed for a photo.
Cruise chose to attend the Grand Prix over King Charles' coronation in England.

Shakira's weekend included more than just racing. She was also recognized as Billboard's first Woman of the Year at the Latin Women in Music gala on Saturday.
The singer, whose world has been upended in the last year, celebrated the power of a woman while seemingly taking a shot at her ex, Gerard Piqué.
""This has been a year of seismic change in my life where I’ve felt more than ever and very personally what it is to be women. And what it means,"" she said to the crowd in Spanish, translated to English by Billboard. ""It’s been a year where I’ve realized we women are stronger than we think, braver than we believed, more independent than we were taught to be. Because what woman hasn’t, at some time in her life, forgotten herself because she’s seeking the attention and love of someone else?""
""It happened to me, more than once,"" she confessed.

""But there comes a time in the life of every woman where she no longer depends on someone else to love and accept herself just as she is,"" she said. ""A time when the search for someone else is replaced by the search for oneself. A time when the desire to be perfect is replaced by the desire to be authentic, and where finding someone who is faithful is less important than being faithful to ourselves.""
She and her partner of 12 years, former FC-Barcelona star Piqué, split last June. Rumors surrounding infidelity on Piqué's part swirled after the couple announced they would be going their separate ways. According to Page Six, fans noticed that Piqué's now girlfriend, Clara Chia Marti, was in the background of a Zoom he had done in 2021.
A source close to Shakira told the outlet that the Grammy Award-winning singer had been ""devastated to learn that this woman clearly felt at home in the house they shared with their children.""
Engaging in a custody battle of their two sons, Milan, 10, and Sasha, 8, Shakira and Piqué reached a custody agreement in November, allowing her to move to Miami with her boys.
""It’s true that when I felt most lost, music put me in the road back to myself. But the most important lessons I learned from other women, and for them, I wrote what I wrote, and I sang what I sang. Because only a woman can love until she’s ripped apart; can speak with the most brutal honesty; can sing with anger; dance in ecstasy and be brought to tears with emotion. Only a woman can do that,"" she said to the audience.
Shakira released a scathing diss-track earlier this year, calling out both Piqué and Marti in ""Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 5.""
Pivoting to more positivity, Shakira went on to applaud her mother, Nidia.
""Mami, despite the hardships you’ve faced this year, you’re still standing with limitless love and resilience. You, mami, have been my woman of the year. So, this recognition is for you, and also for my friends who have supported me and who hold me up when my legs give out.""
She continued: ""I receive this honor with lots of love, but for me, more than celebrating the women of the year, we should celebrate the year of the woman. A year where us women have touched subjects that couldn’t be touched, and said things that couldn’t be said. And though some may have complained, there’s no going back. Together, we’ve taken a step forward, and with each step we’re more free and more fulfilled.""

118,Could Ed Sheeran’s Copyright Win Change Landscape of Music Lawsuits? – The Hollywood Reporter,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/music-news/ed-sheeran-thinking-out-loud-win-analysis-music-lawsuits-future-1235482119/,"Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter

The English singer's court victory might change the narrative of legal conflicts over songs following the major loss 'Blurred Lines' creators Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams experienced.

							By 

	Mesfin Fekadu


	When a jury determined “Blurred Lines” borrowed from Marvin Gaye’s “Got to Give It Up” and Pharrell Williams and Robin Thicke were ordered to pay millions of dollars in damages, it not only shook up the music industry but also set off a flurry of other lawsuits that made songwriters more willing to give credit, whether it was due or not.

	After the 2015 decision, John Legend argued that the verdict would set a bad precedent for artists creating music inspired by others. It certainly set a precedent for legal action as other veteran songwriters decided to go after hitmakers they felt were a little too inspired by their work. Some went to trial, others settled outside the courtroom and a number of artists began extending writing credit to older songs — some because the melodies were similar but others to avoid a repeat of the “Blurred Lines” backlash.

	But Ed Sheeran’s win last week — a jury said his hit “Thinking Out Loud” didn’t steal key components of Gaye’s classic “Let’s Get It On” — could change the narrative.

	“In this particular situation, I think the verdict was right. At some point there are only so many chords or notes you can play. I’m happy with the verdict because it [lets] songwriters [know] that if something small sounds similar, you won’t have to pay for copying something that you really didn’t copy,” Johnta Austin, the Grammy-winning songwriter behind hits like Mariah Carey’s “We Belong Together” and Mary J. Blige’s “Be Without You,” tells The Hollywood Reporter.

	Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars named the writers of the Gap Band’s “Ooops Upside Your Head” as co-writers of the anthemic “Uptown Funk,” Billboard’s No. 1 song of the last decade. The Chainsmokers’ smash “Closer” — No. 3 on that Billboard list — gave writing credit to Isaac Slade and Joe King of The Fray because of commonalities to the rock band’s hit “Over My Head (Cable Car).” And Sam Smith’s Grammy-winning debut hit, “Stay With Me,” added Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne as co-writers because of comparisons to the former’s “I Won’t Back Down.” 

	Sheeran’s eight-year battle was over, but the English superstar let the world know no one left the trial as real winners. “We need to be able to write our original music and engage in independent creation without worrying at every step of the way that such creativity will be wrongly called into question,” he said.

	










	“These chords are common building blocks which were used to create music long before ‘Let’s Get It On’ was written and will be used to make music long after we are all gone,” he said. “They are a songwriter’s ‘alphabet’ — our tool kit and should be there for us all to use. No one owns them or the way they are played, in the same way, nobody owns the color blue.”

Sean Garrett, the Grammy-nominated songwriter-producer behind hits for Beyoncé, Usher and Chris Brown, says Sheeran’s win is great for the industry, but the music community is still rattled.

	“I think the lines are blurred, for sure,” Garrett says. 

	“I think the score is 1-1 now,” he explains about Thicke’s loss and Sheeran’s win. “I don’t think that we are more clear. I don’t think [this new win] brought clarity. I still feel that it’s case-by-case, unfortunately. That’s the part that’s scary.”

	Garrett says he was super-emotional when “Blurred Lines” lost millions of dollars in court. He felt creators were being restricted and limited and had to make music from a fearful place.

	“That was a sad moment for me. I felt like, creatively, you’re really just trying to make great music,” he says. “I tend to really respect Ed Sheeran and Pharrell as creatives and they’re super-talented. They don’t really have to borrow from anyone. They’re just that talented.”

	He adds, “I felt like it was a loss. It wasn’t a good day for music. You want to make music from your heart. You want to make music to make people feel good. You don’t want to make music and feel scared or feel like you’re worried about a lawsuit. It just takes the beauty out of music.”

	










	Austin remembers being in Sheeran’s shoes when a singer claimed elements of her song were lifted to create Carey’s upbeat 2005 jam “It’s Like That,” which he co-wrote with the pop diva, Jermaine Dupri and Manuel Seal. The group had to “turn over our laptops and everything to prove that we never visited this person’s page or website,” Austin recalls.

	“It never went to trial. It didn’t get past a certain stage. But they accused us. And we didn’t borrow from it, so we were in the clear,” he explains.

	“We’ve always credited inspiration that we’ve taken verbatim. When you look at ‘We Belong Together’ and all of the writers that we credited when we used one line,” he added of Carey’s No. 1 song, which interpolates lyrics from Bobby Womack’s “If You Think You’re Lonely Now” and “Two Occasions” by the Deele. 

	“When you’re sued and you know that you didn’t do it and you’re accused of something that you know didn’t do, it’s like, ‘Come on guys.’”

	But this wasn’t Sheeran’s first court case about allegedly stealing music. The singer, along with Tim McGraw and Faith Hill, settled a copyright lawsuit claiming that their song “The Rest of Our Life” was a rip-off of a song by two Australian songwriters called “When I Found You.” Sheeran also won a copyright battle over his megahit “Shape of You” when a judge ruled he didn’t plagiarize another song that claimed Sheeran’s hook was similar to a song he created.

	










Kandi Burruss — the Xscape band member and star of The Real Housewives of Atlanta who has written songs for Destiny’s Child, ‘N Sync and Pink — has a writing credit on “Shape of You” because it borrows from TLC’s pop culture smash “No Scrubs,” which Burruss won a Grammy for co-writing. But she says they had to work out the logistics with Sheeran’s team after the song was released.

	“With ‘Shape of You,’ they reached out to us during the process of him recording the album. We discussed the split or whatever, and then we just didn’t hear anything else about it. But then the song came out and we were like, ‘Oh,’” Burruss recalls. “After we didn’t settle on anything, we thought, ‘OK, well maybe he’s not going to use the song.’”

	The two parties got in touch after the song came out. “And we were like, ‘Oh, OK. Thank you,’” a smiling Burruss says after earning credit on the track, which ranks third on Billboard’s decade-end chart.

	The recent lawsuit against Sheeran’s “Thinking Out Loud” was filed by the heirs of Ed Townsend, who co-wrote “Let’s Get It On” with Gaye. The two sides argued over the songs sharing a similar syncopated chord pattern, which Townsend’s family called the “heart” of “Let’s Get It On.” Sheeran’s lawyers said the similarities were commonplace musical building blocks that are also part of other songs currently available, and the jury found that Sheeran and co-writer Amy Wadge created “Thinking Out Loud” independently.

	










	“If you listen to blues music, and you listen to that popular blues riff [Austin begins singing] — it’s like, ‘Yeah, at some point somebody wrote it first.’ But now at this stage everyone uses it,” Austin says. “There are only so many chords [available].”

	Garrett said he understands both sides. If he weren’t around, he’d want his family to defend the music he created like Townsend’s heirs have done. But he also understands Sheeran’s position.

	“To have to feel like you’re dealing with legal ramifications for something that you’re doing with so much passion, it’s just a very scary thing. It’s like, ‘I might go to jail for what I love to do?’ It sucks,” Garrett said.

	“I am so touched by the situation because it’s such an in-the-middle thing. It’s gut-wrenching. This is worse than a horror movie.”

122,Review: Smashing Pumpkins’ ‘ATUM: Act Three’ – Rolling Stone,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/smashing-pumpkins-atum-act-three-1234731395/,"
							By 

	Dan Epstein


Say what you  like about Billy Corgan–and, let’s be honest, you could say quite a bit– you’ve gotta give the man props for his tireless work ethic and relentless creative energy. Even while putting the finishing touches on Cyr, the Smashing Pumpkins’ 20-song 2020 release, Corgan was already deep into crafting ATUM: A Rock Opera in Three Acts, a 33-song trilogy he described as a sequel to 1995’s Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness and 2000’s Machina/The Machines of God. However tortured Corgan may seem at times, it’s clear that his demons do not manifest in the form of writer’s block.   

	Of course, a 33-song album totaling nearly two hours and twenty minutes would be a lot to digest for even the most adoring Pumpkins fans, so Corgan wisely decided to premiere ATUM’s songs one at a time via his weekly podcast, and split the album’s official release into three 11-song segments. Act One was released in November 2022, Act Two in January 2023, and Act Three was finally released last week. Though considerably longer than either of the two previous installments, Act Three is the easiest to take in at first listen; more varied in tone, tempo and atmosphere, Act Three breathes in a way that its densely packed predecessors don’t. It is, however, also the most synth-heavy of the three acts, which means that Pumpkins fans still clinging tightly to the memory of the guitar-heavy onslaughts of 1991’s Gish or 1993’s Siamese Dream may find it disappointing, or even downright infuriating.

	But if you can hang with Corgan’s flights of electronic fancy, ATUM: Act Three contains no shortage of highlights. With its synth strings and yacht-rock chords, the lengthy opener “Sojourner” could be a direct descendant of Gary Wright’s spacy mid-seventies keyboard opus The Dream Weaver. “Pacer” goes hard into eighties territory, with glacial synth textures that eventually give way to a Giorgio Moroder-esque dance groove. And the nine-minute epic “Intergalactic” twice builds from a brooding electro pulse into a dramatic rock assault led by the rampaging drums of Jimmy Chamberlin, who sounds as powerful as ever here and on the more straight-ahead rock tracks “In Lieu of Failure,” “Harmageddon” and “Spellbinding”. Best of all are “The Canary Trainer” and “Cenotaph” — the former a goth-tinged mid-tempo track that sounds like a collision between The Cure and The Church, and the latter an intimate acoustic ballad colored by moody synth squiggles.

	What these songs mean, and how they all fit into ATUM’s story line — which is essentially an expansive sci-fi metaphor for Corgan’s experiences after reviving the Smashing Pumpkins in 2007 — can take some time to parse. A lyric like “In parried odes to thy mountains/The spirit of us was pungent laughter”(from “Intergalactic”) would be difficult to wrap your mind around even if it weren’t obscured by Corgan’s eccentric enunciation, and the fact that his vocals are often mixed down to point where his voice simply blends into the music like another instrument. But that’s also part of the point here; ATUM is clearly meant to be the kind of record that requires your full attention, and Act Three makes for a nicely trippy conclusion to the whole project, as well as an intriguing listening experience in and of itself.

It’s not Bridgerton if there is no orchestral version of a pop song. Shonda Rhimes’s Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story, the latest entry in the sprawling Netflix costume-drama universe, one-ups its own formula by giving fans a live music video for Alicia Keys’s “If I Ain’t Got You” orchestral arrangement. In the show, we hear the instrumental version, which is all well and good, but the music video contains an all-women-of-color orchestra, a Regency-era dress code (gowns — beautiful gowns), a 19th-century English ballroom, plus the added bonus of Keys on the keys, lending her signature vocals. The visuals are lush. Black women painted with dramatic makeup wear pantaloons and lacy corsets to create editorial tableaux reminiscent of a Beyoncé visual album. The camera pans over each section of the symphony and its Black woman conductor. The harpists, cellists, percussionists, and more — playing in harmony as the piece hits its crescendo — wear Empire waists and satin gloves. There’s another reason for the gathering: the 20th anniversary of “If I Ain’t Got You.” It’s high time we had another version of the touching classic to move us to tears yet again. We can feed on this until we get Renaissance images.

124,"Morgan Wallen No. 1, Rema & Selena Gomez’ No. 5 on Hot 100 – Billboard",https://www.billboard.com/music/chart-beat/morgan-wallen-last-night-rema-selena-gomez-calm-down-hot-100-top-10-1235324287/,"""Last Night"" becomes the first song to top the Hot 100 and Country Airplay charts simultaneously.

													By
												

	Gary Trust


Morgan Wallen’s “Last Night” adds a fifth week at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart. It first led in March, becoming his initial leader on the list.

	Notably, as “Last Night” ascends to No. 1 on the Country Airplay chart, it becomes the first song ever to have topped that tally and the Hot 100 simultaneously.

	Elsewhere, Eslabon Armado and Peso Pluma’s “Ella Baila Sola” holds at its No. 4 Hot 100 high, the best rank ever for a regional Mexican song. It concurrently hits No. 1 on Streaming Songs – becoming the first regional Mexican title to rule that chart.

	










	Plus, Rema and Selena Gomez’s “Calm Down” rises 6-5 on the Hot 100, marking the former’s first top five hit and Gomez’s fourth.

	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data. All charts (dated May 13, 2023) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow (May 9). For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both Twitter and Instagram.

	Wallen’s “Last Night,” released on Big Loud/Mercury/Republic Records, drew 55.9 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 17%) and 32.4 million streams (down 4%) and sold 9,000 downloads (down 7%) in the April 28-May 4 tracking week, according to Luminate.

	The single slips to No. 2 after seven weeks atop the Streaming Songs chart; rebounds 4-2 on Digital Song Sales, following a week on top; and pushes 7-5 on Radio Songs, where Wallen earns his first top five hit.

	As previously reported, “Last Night” crowns the Country Airplay chart, vaulting from No. 5 (as it also scales the top 15 of both Pop Airplay and Adult Pop Airplay). It makes history as the first song to top the Hot 100 and Country Airplay simultaneously, dating to the latter’s January 1990 inception. (The Hot 100 began in August 1958.) It’s just the second song to have ruled both the Hot 100 and Country Airplay overall, after Lonestar’s “Amazed” led the Hot 100 for two weeks in March 2000, propelled in part by pop and adult crossover airplay. The ballad had dominated Country Airplay for a then-record eight weeks in July-September 1999.

	“Last Night” concurrently leads the Hot Country Songs chart, which uses the same methodology as the Hot 100, for a 13th week. It became just the 20th song to have topped both charts. As it has now ruled the Hot 100 for five weeks and Hot Country Songs for 13, among those 20 songs, its 18 combined weeks atop the rankings mark the most, surpassing Johnny Horton’s “The Battle of New Orleans,” which spent six and 10 weeks at No. 1, respectively, in 1959.

	SZA’s “Kill Bill” keeps at No. 2 on the Hot 100, two weeks after it became her first No. 1. It concurrently commands the multi-metric Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot R&B Songs charts for a 19th and 20th week, respectively. On Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, “Kill Bill” claims the sole second-longest No. 1 run – and moves to within a week of tying the record for the longest.

T.I. + Pharrell, 201315, “Be Without You,” Mary J. Blige, 2006

	










	Miley Cyrus’ “Flowers” holds at No. 3 on the Hot 100, after eight weeks at No. 1, beginning upon its debut in January. It logs a 12th week atop Radio Songs (90.7 million in audience, down 1%).

	Eslabon Armado and Peso Pluma’s “Ella Baila Sola” repeats at its No. 4 high on the Hot 100, the best rank ever for a regional Mexican song in the chart’s history. It concurrently climbs 2-1 on Streaming Songs (34.6 million, up 2%) – becoming the first regional Mexican song to lead the list. The collaboration also adds a fifth week at No. 1 on the multi-metric Hot Latin Songs chart.

	Rema and Selena Gomez’s “Calm Down” rises 6-5 on the Hot 100, with 78.9 million in airplay audience (up 19%), 15.7 million streams (up 1%) and 5,000 sold (up 3%).

	Rema released the original version of “Calm Down” in February 2022 as a single from his debut solo LP, Rave & Roses. Its remix with Gomez arrived last August, and that version’s official video premiered in September.

	Rema hits the Hot 100’s top five with his first entry on the chart. Gomez adds her fourth top five hit, as “Calm Down” joins “Lose You To Love Me” (No. 1, one week, November 2019), “Same Old Love” (No. 5, January 2016) and “Good for You,” featuring A$AP Rocky (No. 5, October 2015).

	“Calm Down” simultaneously tops the Billboard U.S. Afrobeats Songs chart for a 36th week, extending the longest rule since the ranking began just over a year ago (in partnership with music festival and global brand Afro Nation). As previously reported, it also ascends to No. 1 on the Pop Airplay chart, becoming the first hit to have led both Billboard U.S. Afrobeats Songs and Pop Airplay.

	










	Metro Boomin, The Weeknd and 21 Savage’s “Creepin’ “ lifts 7-6 on the Hot 100, after hitting No. 3; Grupo Frontera and Bad Bunny’s “Un x100to” backtracks to No. 7 from its No. 5 high, a week after it became the chart’s second-ever top five regional Mexican hit; The Weeknd and Ariana Grande’s “Die for You” holds at No. 8, following a week at No. 1 in March; and PinkPantheress and Ice Spice’s “Boy’s a Liar, Pt. 2” is steady at No. 9, after reaching No. 3.

	Rounding out the Hot 100’s top 10, Taylor Swift’s “Anti-Hero” keeps at No. 10. The song became her sole longest-leading No. 1, for eight weeks in November-January. It adds a 26th week in the top 10, likewise extending her longest run in the region.

125,Dianna Agron responds to Taylor Swift relationship rumors | EW.com,https://ew.com/celebrity/dianna-agron-responds-taylor-swift-relationship-rumors/,"Dianna Agron isn't convinced she's the muse for ""22"" by Taylor Swift.
The former Glee star responded to fan speculation that she inspired the track from Swift's 2012 album Red in an interview with Rolling Stone published Sunday — and also laughed off decades-long rumors that she dated the Grammy-winning pop star. 
""Me? Oh, if only!"" Agron said when told she's long believed to have inspired the song. ""That's more because of a friendship than being the inspiration for the song. But I would not be the person to ask about that. I cannot claim that!""
Agron — endearingly unfamiliar with the word ""shipped,"" used by fans to pair celebrities as ideal couples — called the dating rumors ""so interesting."" 
""I mean, there have been many stories about my dating life that are so wildly untrue,"" she said. ""That's funny.""
Agron and Swift were regularly photographed together between 2011 and 2012, prompting fan theories that the relationship might have been romantic. 
In the wide-ranging interview, Agron also discussed her role in the upcoming Hulu drama film Clock, centered on a woman who enrolls in a clinical trial to fix her broken biological clock amid pressure to have children, and looked back on her time on Glee. 
""I think it was a sliding scale of appropriate to terribly inappropriate, and especially if you're playing a character who people find to be attractive, or you are a young person who people find to be fit in a box that they would like to put you in, which is 'young and sexy,'"" she said of being a young female star on the series. ""That was the hardest thing for me to reconcile with.""
As for Swift, the pop star has been in the midst of her Eras Tour and recently announced that the re-recorded version of her third studio album, Speak Now, would arrive July 7. 
""I always looked at this album as my album, and the lump in my throat expands to a quivering voice as I say this,"" she wrote in a note. ""Thanks to you, dear reader, it finally will be. I consider this music to be, along with your faith in me, the best thing that's ever been mine.""

126,Christina Applegate says she won't return to TV and film following multiple sclerosis diagnosis | CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/08/entertainment/christina-applegate-acting-multiple-sclerosis/index.html,"
      Christina Applegate says she’s done with on-camera work while she is living with multiple sclerosis.
  

      The “Dead to Me” actress told Vanity Fair that her time on that hit Netflix series is probably her last and that she loved working with co-star Linda Cardellini.
  

      “I’m probably not going to work on-camera again,” Applegate said.
  

      “Ping-pong is so much more fun when the other person is just as good as you are,” she added, referring to working with Cardellini. “I’m so glad that I went out with someone who is by far the greatest actress I’ve ever worked with in my entire life, if not the greatest human I’ve ever known.”
  

      Applegate was diagnosed with MS in August 2021. 


      The disease affects the central nervous system and muscle control. She had been filming “Dead to Me” and the show paused production so she could start treatment.
  

      Applegate added that she will miss the show, telling Vanity Fair that she loves her coworkers and crew, but that the past year has been a “struggle.”
  

      “I miss the experience of it, but at the same time, because it was such an incredible struggle this last year, I’m relieved that I no longer have to push so hard to get through my day,” she said.

127,Jamie Foxx's friends and family aren't sharing his medical diagnosis. Here's why | CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/08/entertainment/jamie-foxx-medical-condition/index.html,"
      Jamie Foxx was hospitalized weeks ago but there’s still not much publicly known. 
  

      Anyone who has followed Jamie Foxx’s career closely, however, shouldn’t be surprised by that.
  

      On April 11, Foxx was hospitalized in Atlanta, Georgia, where he had been filming the Netflix movie, “Back in Action.” 
  

      CNN has reached out to reps for Foxx multiple times for information on both what happened and the actor’s status, and has been unable to get additional details from them.
  

      There has been practically no information released other than his family initially asking for privacy and a post last week on Foxx’s verified social media account. 


      “Appreciate all the love!!!” the post reads.“Feeling blessed.” 
  

      The desire for privacy is in keeping with how the “Ray” star has always lived, despite a career that puts him in the spotlight.
  

      A perusal of interviews with Foxx over the years yields plenty of information about his thoughts on his roles, a multitude of jokes, some information about his childhood and very little insight into his actual personal life. 
  

      Foxx reportedly dated fellow superstar Katie Holmes, the ex-wife of Tom Cruise, for half a dozen years – a relationship neither ever confirmed on the record despite being photographed over the years during what appeared to be romantic dates or moments where they were affectionate with one another. 
  

      In 2016, former “Real Housewives of Atlanta” cast member Claudia Jordan appeared to confirm Foxx and Holmes were dating during a podcast appearance saying, “He is very happy with her. I like that he seems very happy.”
  

      Jordan later clarified her comments, telling “Entertainment Tonight” she “misspoke.”
  

      “I have no knowledge of Jamie with Katie at all,” she said. “I’ve never seen them together.” 
  

      Two years later, Foxx was being interviewed by SportsCenter host Michael Smith about participating in an NBA celebrity basketball game when Smith asked the star, “Did you and Katie Holmes play basketball for Valentine’s Day? Like some real Love & Basketball?”
  

      Foxx abruptly ended the interview by taking off his headset and walking away.
  

      Foxx and Holmes reportedly split in 2019. 
  

      So the silence surrounding Foxx’s “medical complication,” to use his family’s words initially, seems in keeping with how the performer conducts himself.
  

      Celebrities have handled such situations in a variety of ways, from Jeremy Renner’s very public recuperation following being run over by a snow plow to Chadwick Boseman’s colon cancer diagnosis not becoming public until after the “Black Panther” actor’s death.
  

      Those who know Foxx have been circumspect when they do talk about his current state.
  

      During an interview on the “Impaulsive” podcast released last week, Kevin Hart said he was “fortunate” to have a close enough friendship with Foxx that he can check on him.
  

      Hart said Foxx is “getting better” and also touched on why not much has been shared about him publicly from Foxx’s inner circle. 
  

      “They’re being tight for reasons just about where he is because Jamie’s always been a private person to a certain degree,” Hart said. 
  

      Fox network has announced that that Nick Cannon will be filling in as guest host on “Beat Shazam,” a musical game show that Foxx hosts with his daughter, Corinne.
  

A previous version of this story incorrectly stated Foxx was transported to the hospital via emergency vehicle.

Angelina Jolie has shared a heartbreaking tribute on Instagram.
On Monday morning the Oscar-winning Girl, Interrupted actress posted an old photo with her mother Marcheline Bertrand.
Jolie had blonder hair as she wore a white summer dress and beige straw hat while posing with her mom, who passed away in 2007, in the early Eighties.
The resemblance of the 47-year-old Maleficent actress to her mother - who was also an actress - is unmistakable.
In her caption, the mother of six - who was seen leaving Washington DC last week - penned a sweet message. 'Tomorrow would have been my mother’s 73rd birthday,' began the ex-wife of Brad Pitt.
Her sad loss: Angelina Jolie has shared a heartbreaking tribute to her late mother Marcheline Bertrand on Instagram on Monday morning. In her caption, she penned a sweet message. 'Tomorrow would have been my mother’s 73rd birthday,' began the ex-wife of Brad Pitt
Hard to look back: Jolie then explained that Marcheline passed away 15 years ago. It was 'after a long struggle with breast and ovarian cancer,' noted the humanitarian. 'In June, I will be a month away from the age when she was diagnosed,' she shared; seen in April
Hard truth to face: 'In June, I will be a month away from the age when she was diagnosed,' she noted. 'I have had preventive surgeries to try to lessen chances but I continue to have check ups,' she said. Seen with her mother in 2001
Jolie then explained that Marcheline passed away 15 years ago.
It was 'after a long struggle with breast and ovarian cancer,' noted the humanitarian. 
'In June, I will be a month away from the age when she was diagnosed,' she said.
'I have had preventive surgeries to try to lessen chances but I continue to have check ups,' wrote the Those Who Wish Me Dead star.
Jolie underwent a double mastectomy in 2013 so she would not get breast cancer.
It was what is called a prophylactic double mastectomy. That means she had both of her breasts removed even though she had not been diagnosed with breast cancer. She said she did this because she carries a gene, called BRCA1, that significantly increases the odds of developing breast or ovarian cancer.
Jolie then talked about her mother's personality.
'My mom loved Hendrix. And would always sign her letters Kiss the Sky,' shared the Salt star.
'It took on new meaning after she passed. Sending my love to those who have also lost loved ones and strength to those who are fighting at this very moment for their lives and the lives of those they love. 
Mama bear: (L-R) Maddox, Vivienne, Angelina, Knox, Shiloh, and Zahara attend the Los Angeles premiere of Eternals in 2021
'And to other women, please take the time to look after yourself and go for your mammograms and blood tests or ultrasounds, particularly if you have a family history of cancer.'
She then said that there was more info in her bio and added '#WOCD2023 #worldovariancancerday.'
Beverly Hills, 90210 actress Shannen Doherty, who has cancer, liked the post. 
Jolie's father is actor Jon Voight whom she acted with in Tomb Raider. The two have had a difficult relationship but do not seem to be estranged.
This comes after Jolie and her son Maddox were among the high-profile names to attend the White House state dinner in the nation's capitol in late April.
This year, President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden hosted South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol and his wife Kim Keon-hee in celebration of the 70th anniversary of the U.S.-ROK alliance.
Angelina and her eldest child, 21, were dressed to the nines for the lavish affair and had the pleasure of witnessing President Yoon belt out Don McLean's 1971 hit American Pie.
Maddox - who was adopted by the actress from Cambodia in 2002 - is very familiar with South Korea after studying biochemistry at Yonsei University in Seoul.
Angelina flew to South Korea to send her son off to college in August 2019.
In DC! Jolie and her son Maddox were among the high-profile names to attend the White House state dinner in the nation's capitol 
Meet n greet: Kim Keon Hee (L), wife of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, meets with US actress Angelina 
They first visited the school, as well as other college campuses in South Korea, in late 2018.
Although he 'got accepted to other universities,' Maddox ultimately decided that Yonsei was the right fit for him, as reported by PEOPLE at the time.
Along with biochemistry courses, the outlet claimed that Maddox was 'studying Korean language.'
But Maddox's study abroad was interrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic which forced him to trade in-person classes for online school.
As a result, he returned to his family home in Los Angeles in March 2020, according to Angelina, who opened up about her son's education in an interview with Extra that year.
She worked with the UN for 20 years: The humanitarian said she is dedicated to working with refugees
Because his classes remained on Korea time, the Changeling star revealed that Maddox had no choice but to become a night owl. 
'He had to stay back from Korea. He's going online, and so I think he starts at 6pm at night,' she told the outlet.
Maddox eventually retuned to South Korea in March of 2021 after a year of remote learning.
The Sun reported in 2021 that classes - specifically 'labs, studio and field study courses' - recommenced that April.
Angelina previously gushed over her son's ambitious academic pursuits to PEOPLE in 2019, telling the outlet that she is 'nothing but proud' of him.
She added: 'I look forward to all he will do.' It's unclear whether or not Maddox has officially completed his degree at Yonsei.

132,Blood In Cody Rhodes/Brock Lesnar Match At WWE Backlash Was Reportedly Planned,https://www.wrestlinginc.com/1279595/blood-in-cody-rhodesbrock-lesnar-match-at-wwe-backlash-was-reportedly-planned/,"Bloody brawls have gone hand in hand with professional wrestling in Puerto Rico over the years, and that was no different at WWE Backlash last Saturday when Brock Lesnar was busted open during his main event match with Cody Rhodes. Given how blood is a rarity in WWE these days, however, some wondered whether the cut was intentional or an accident.


As it turns out, it was the former. Per both Fightful Select and the Wrestling Observer Newsletter, the blood in the Lesnar/Rhodes match was planned. And while blading or blood is generally frowned upon in WWE — and is generally dealt with quickly when it occurs — in this instance, it was given the green light with Lesnar displaying the proverbial crimson mask after being sent face first into an exposed turnbuckle by Rhodes. Undaunted, Lesnar continued coming and appeared to have ""The American Nightmare"" dead to rights with the Kimura lock hooked in. However, Rhodes managed to turn the tides and scored the surprise pinfall, leaving ""The Beast"" shocked.
While the win wasn't as definitive as Rhodes might have hoped, Rhodes' attention now turns to the tournament to crown the new WWE World Heavyweight Champion, which begins tonight on ""WWE Raw."" Rhodes will be one of six ""Raw"" stars participating in tonight's tournament matches, including Seth Rollins, The Miz, Sheamus, Shinsuke Nakamura, and Damian Priest. If Lesnar will be at ""Raw"" remains a mystery as the longtime WWE star is currently a free agent following the WWE Draft and can appear whenever and wherever he pleases.

“Haven’t had any nicotine in about a little over a year now,” DeMarco said: “I did it on the Five Easy Hot Dogs trip, driving from New York to Salt Lake City — it was a horrible drive. I did that, and now I don’t do caffeine either … It’s not about being ‘straight,’ it’s about being free. I’m going to acupuncture. He says no cold foods, so there’s not going to be any more cold foods. No cold water, only hot water … and steak.” 
“My journey with sobriety or whatever — I don’t have a journey, that sounds a bit weird,” he continued. “I’m not the most ‘sober guy’ sober guy, but I think I don’t like being beholden to things like that. As humans, what are we? We gotta have water, you gotta have shelter, you gotta have food — that’s enough things to be trapped by. I don’t want to be trapped by alcohol, I don’t want to be trapped by cigarettes.”
“The real thing?” DeMarco went on. “I quit cigarettes and started vaping. That’s a problem. Marlboro Reds? You can get them any … go to a little town in China somewhere, they’re gonna have Marlboro Reds. Juul? Mhmmm … I remember I crossed into Canada and everyone was like, ‘Wow, you have a Juul, that’s so rare and interesting’ and I was like ‘Noooo…’ I don’t want that, I want ease of life. All I need is that air I breathe and hot water, no cold water.”

137,Jennifer Lopez Talks About Parenting Blended Family With Ben Affleck,https://www.insider.com/jennifer-lopez-parenting-blended-family-ben-affleck-2023-5,"Jump to




Jennifer Lopez shared the dynamics of parenting with Ben Affleck in the lead-up to the couple's one-year marriage anniversary.
On May 4, Lopez said in a guest appearance on ""The View"" that Affleck is an ""amazing dad"" to his children from his previous marriage. 
""It brings tears to my eyes, he is honestly the best dad I have ever seen,"" she said, explaining that Affleck has sometimes taught her new things about how to interact with their kids.
""He's such a brilliant guy anyway, and you can tell that when he had his kids he must have read every book and everything that you could possibly learn about children, and he applies it,"" she said.
Lopez added: ""He's present, and that's all you can ask, for a present, loving dad who shows up every single day, and that's who he is."" 
After originally dating in the early 2000s, Affleck and Lopez rekindled their relationship during the pandemic and were married in July 2022. Lopez has two children from her previous marriage to Marc Anthony, while Affleck has three children with his ex-wife Jennifer Garner, who he was married to from June 2005 to October 2018. 
When asked by the show's hosts who plays ""good cop"" and ""bad cop"" in their blended family, Lopez referred back to her own relationship with her mother, who she said did most of the disciplining in the household. 
""I remember my mom saying to me, 'I'm always the bad guy,'"" Lopez explained, going on to talk about her relationship with her own children by saying, ""There is some truth to that, you know, the mom, you get a little bit of the brunt of it."" 
""They need that too,"" Lopez said, referring to discipline. 
Lopez went on to say that her children, 15-year-old twins Emme and Max, have reached an age where they ""don't want to talk"" to her so much. 
""It's all necessary, and intellectually, I understand it, but my heart, my heart hurts,"" she said. 
Affleck and Lopez originally began dating in 2002, after they both starred in the 2001 comedy ""Gigli,"" and got engaged that year, but ended up postponing the wedding and splitting up in January 2004. 
In February 2022, Lopez spoke on ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show"" about getting back together with Affleck. 
""I don't think anybody was more surprised than us,"" Lopez said. ""You never could imagine something like that could happen. It's a beautiful thing.""

In the wake of scaring up over $100 million at the worldwide box office, Bloody Disgusting can exclusively report today that Evil Dead Rise is now headed home this week!
Experience a riveting, gore-filled nightmare when Evil Dead Rise arrives for purchase Digitally at home on May 9. The film will also be available to purchase on 4K UHD Combo Pack, Blu-ray and DVD beginning on June 27. Here’s everything you need to know:
Evil Dead Rise is directed by Lee Cronin, starring Lily Sullivan (“I Met a Girl,” TV’s “Barkskins”) and Alyssa Sutherland (TV’s “New Gold Mountain,” TV’s “Vikings).
From New Line Cinema and Renaissance Pictures, the film also stars Morgan Davies (TV’s “The End,” “Storm Boy”), Gabrielle Echols (“Reminiscence”) and introducing Nell Fisher (“Northspur”). The film was produced by longtime franchise producer Rob Tapert and executive produced by series creator and horror icon Sam Raimi and cult legend and “Ash” himself, Bruce Campbell, along with John Keville, Macdara Kelleher, Richard Brener, Dave Neustadter, Romel Adam and Victoria Palmeri.
In Evil Dead Rise, the action moves out of the woods and into the city, and tells a twisted tale of two estranged sisters, played by Sullivan and Sutherland, whose reunion is cut short by the rise of flesh-possessing demons, thrusting them into a primal battle for survival as they face the most nightmarish version of family imaginable.
Meagan Navarro writes in her Evil Dead Rise review for BD, “Evil Dead Rise is an absolute crowd pleaser that’s best enjoyed with a rowdy crowd of fellow fans.”

The latest taut horror-thriller from M. Night Shyamalan, Knock at the Cabin has arrived on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray, and DVD. While there’s no audio commentary, the home video releases include four making-of featurettes: “Choosing Wisely: Behind the Scenes of Knock at the Cabin,” “Tools of the Apocalypse,” “Drawing a Picture,” and “Kristen Cui Shines a Light.”
Totalling about 35 minutes, these extras feature insight from Shyamalan, actors Dave Bautista, Jonathan Groff, Ben Aldridge, Nikki Amuka-Bird, Abby Quinn, Rupert Grint, and Kristen Cui, and several key crew members.
Here are seven things I learned from the Knock at the Cabin Blu-ray…
1. Knock at the Cabin came to Shyamalan as a producing opportunity.

Shyamalan originally received the Knock at the Cabin script by Steve Desmond and Michael Sherman as a producing opportunity via his Blinding Edge Pictures before deciding to work on the screenplay and board the project as director.
“It organically came into my life,” Shyamalan explains. “It came as a producing opportunity. I think the premise of the book just stayed with me so much, and I started to kind of fall in love with the idea and just let my mind feely go to, ‘How would I tell this story?’ or ‘What would be best for this story?'”
2. The premise resonated with Shyamalan and the cast.

“The idea of telling large-scale, Biblical stories but in modern times and in modern settings is resonating with me,” enthuses Shyamalan. “Knock at the Cabin is that, is this kind of incredible opportunity for us to experience this gigantic, global, Biblical story, but just through the experience of a family of three.”
The cast was also captivated by the material. “When I read the script, I was breathless through the entire thing. I felt great anxiety and confusion and excitement and shock and horror,” exclaims Groff. Amuka-Bird adds, “I was gripped from beginning to end. I was terrified.”
“It kind of combined two of my biggest nightmares: home invasion and the apocalypse,” Grint notes. “It stayed with me a long time, because it forces you to kind of put yourself in a situation and think what would you do.”
3. Knock at the Cabin deviates from the source material.

Knock at the Cabin is based on Paul Tremblay’s 2018 novel, The Cabin at the End of the World. While the two set-ups are essentially identical, the movie’s third act radically deviates from the source material.
“It’s very unusual, in that we adapted a book to make this movie but essentially went in an entirely different direction around the midway point of the story. That weighed on me a little bit,” confesses Shyamalan. “In my mind, the story needed and wanted to go this way very strongly, and in fact that was the exciting part of the challenge. Can I make a movie about a very horrific Sophie’s choice, and can I get the audience there to make that decision with the main characters?”
4. The film’s gay representation was important to Shyamalan.

Although Knock at the Cabin deviates from the book, Shayamlan maintained the central characters being a same-sex couple with an adopted daughter. It was important to him to cast gay actors in the parts of the fathers.
“Telling a story that would normally have been told with a typical husband-wife story and having it told with these two people; super, super moving. As a viewer, watching as we shot this and made this, I was feeling things that I never felt before for protagonists. I was seeing dynamics that were fresh and new.”
The representation also impacted the actors. “Something that attracted me to it and that I love about it is that it’s about a same-sex parented family, and they are central to the story. Their queerness is part of the story but it’s not the story,” Aldridge notes. “We are pinching ourselves that we get to be in this Hollywood horror movie as gay actors playing gay characters in an M. Night Shyamalan movie,” Groff says.
5. Shyamalan meticulously storyboarded the entire film.

While his visual style constantly evolves, Shyamalan meticulously storboards every movie so he knows exactly what he wants and needs before stepping on set. Brick Mason — Shyamalan’s go-to storyboard artist since The Sixth Season, with other credits including The Amazing Spider-Man 2, A Beautiful Mind, and True Detective — is no stranger to the process:
“When he’s finished writing the script, storyboarding is the next big phase, and he’s converting those words into pictures. He wants to see in his head every single shot. In the end, when he gets it the way he wants it, he sticks [to the storybaords] way more closely than pretty much any director that I’ve ever worked with.”
Shyamalan explains, “I’ve spent five, six, seven, eight months alone thinking about that, and every color, every choice, every fabric, every frame, every single frame has been chosen to maximize the emotional impact of the characters.”
Mason continues, “By the time he’s done storyboarding and he’s explored the emotions of every single character in every single scene, the storyboards are in a sense like a bible to him for that project.”
6. Shyamalan does not shoot standard film coverage.

Since the storyboarding process affords Shyamalan the knowledge of exactly what he needs, he does not shoot standard film coverage (a wide master shot, close ups, etc. for every scene). He rehearses with the cast like a play and then aims to get three good takes each with something unique.
“I want to feel that electricity in the performance, that unexpected thing of realness, and I want it three times. Why I want it three times is, there’s a relationship to everything that we’re putting next to each other. That thing that was so beautiful-angry or so beautiful-vulnerable or beautiful-soft or -scared won’t play with the previous scene or the previous thing. The juxtaposition, it’s always about the family and how they interact together, so I try to get at least three amazing takes of slightly different colors so that I have a little bit of pliability. This color vs. this color creates this experience.
“Sometimes you only get one that really has that electricity, and when I have to move onto another shot with that feeling that I have one — and it’s rare that I would move on — I’m very nervous, because I know there’s a high probability that that won’t be the perfect color against this other thing, and I have nowhere to go because I don’t do coverage.”
7. Shyamalan challenged the art department to design makeshift weapons for the film.

Seeing them as emblematic of the movie’s core, Shyamalan placed an importance on the makeshift weapons that the strangers carry. He described it as a bake off, challenging the art department to concoct deadly combinations of tools, farming equipment, and othet sharp objects.
“We started putting ourselves in the character that is making the weapon, and it was like, if it’s hard for us, it doesn’t make sense for the film,” explains production designer Naaman Marshall. “We’re talking about people who just got the vision. That started changing our techniques about how we went about it, and it very much became about finding parts that were visual, that they might have seen in a vision. It started driving the actual visual of the weapons by the process at which we thought these people would be able to make them.”
Each of the four weapons — nicknamed by the crew as cowkiller, sleeper, morning star, halberd — were crafted in firm, medium and soft versions for various uses.
Knock at the Cabin is available now on 4K UHD, Blu-ray, and DVD via Universal.

139,"‘Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3’ Sees $118M Box Office, Promo Campaign $90M – Deadline",https://deadline.com/2023/05/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3-box-office-marketing-campaign-mcdonalds-1235359041/,"
					By Anthony D'Alessandro 
Editorial Director/Box Office Editor

	James Gunn’s MCU threequel, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, came in even higher than Disney was anticipating. We had a sense it was $116M on Saturday night. The pic is now at $118.4M per Disney this morning after a $31.4M Sunday (yesterday was forecasted at $27M). That’s the 12th highest opening of all-time during the month of May, and $8M+ ahead of the projected $110M. 

	Disney accomplished this feat this AM off a global promotional partner campaign valued at $90M, ad sources tell us.  I understand that amount is more than double the spend for the two previous Guardians of the Galaxy films combined.

	In keeping with the theme of the film, multiple partners licensed popular songs from the 80s and 90s for inclusion in their co-branded spots to link to key themes (e.g., family, fun, comedy). Those partners included McDonald’s, King’s Hawaiian, General Mills, Enterprise, Microsoft, Realtor.com and Cisco.

	McDonald’s debuted a Happy Meal program in the US, LATAM and China, coupled with eight toys of the film characters that link together. This was further supported with an UberEats US BOGO offer. To bring the film to life, a custom “in-world” TV spot set in “Knowhere” (the Guardians new home base) was revealed featuring a dance-off with Groot. 

	King’s Hawaiian bread co. kicked off grilling season with a custom spot about a family barbecue with some new guests including Rocket and Groot as well as a movie offer at 13K US national grocery/mass retailers. 

	NASCAR got in on the action too with a film-themed wrapped car driven by Brad Keselowski that debuted during the AdventHealth 400 NASCAR Cup Series race.

	HelloFresh launched a new, limited edition Guardians Recipe Adventure series with six recipes inspired by the film along with Guardians Snack Adventure Kits so fans could create HelloFresh versions of two tasty intergalactic snacks – Zarg Nut Bites and Mango Milky Fizz, complete with collectible milk cartons and jars. In the custom spot we see what brought “aliens” to the office. Campaign was tied into a sweepstakes with No. 3 circuit Cinemark.

	General Mills cereals had GOTG3 takeovers on boxes of Cinnamon Toast Crunch, Lucky Charms, Reese’s Puffs, Trix and Cookie Crisp, Groot-Gurt Go-Gurt and limited-edition cereal kits with film-themed pin sets available at Walmart starting.

	










	Enterprise timed its campaign to the kickoff of summer travel season tied to the film’s theme of exploration with TV/digital and social support, a world premiere sponsorship and custom spot.

	Microsoft, a longstanding MCU partner, leveraged its Zune MP3 film integration by paying homage to the original failed device and teaming up with Redwire to give it a second chance on board the International Space Station through 3D-printing technology. Microsoft launched an entire website dedicated to its gadget featuring a short ad with the Guardians which promoted education among students, creating different space-themed activities on the website for young explorers.

	Realtor.com’s campaign was inspired by the intergalactic locations seen in the Guardians films and gave fans a chance to “own your place in space.” Fans were able to take a quiz to earn digital “units” to unlock coordinates for their very own piece of the galaxy, with locations spanning six intergalactic settings from the MCU including Knowhere, Morag and Sovereign. 

	There was also a team-up between Disney Marvel Studios and Cisco which centered around protection with the brand’s new multi-factor authentication security product. This included a spot that celebrated the parallels of the Guardians (a force for good throughout the galaxy) and Cisco Duo (a guardian for the good of businesses across the globe) along with a Fandango ticket offer for a chance to win passes to see the film.

	In China, juggernauts Alipay and JD supported the pic with cinema advertising and tech companies Samsung, Netease and Razer contributed with out-door and digital/social. Other markets that participated included Indonesia, Malaysia, Phillipines, Singapore, Thailand, Korea and Vietnam with activations like special ticket offers, in-store POS, film-themed mall installations and gift with purchase.

	In Brazil, Visa’s rewards program supported the threequel with cinema advertising and more. Kia held a sweepstakes in Mexico for a trip for four and Motorola had a gift with purchase. Virgin Plus was a partner in Canada. 

	Deadline was there at San Diego Comic-Con last July when Gunn first took the stage with the cast, showed off the first footage and the High Evolutionary crashed Hall H. That’s when the GOTG3 campaign officially launched. 

	At Brazil Comic Con in December, the teaser trailer debuted, which led to a simultaneous online debut along with the Teaser Poster. The trailer debut was in the upper comps generating 121M views in 24-hrs, and the trailer trended on Twitter and rose to the #2 trend.

	Among some of the broadcast stunts to push the pic, SportsCenter anchors, Jason Fitz and Arda Ocal, became swole like Groot in a custom content piece featuring the pic’s star Chris Pratt. On Adult Swim, a “Grootologist” broke down the meaning of “I am Groot” in custom content. At ABC, three was an in-episode story moments featuring film mentions with surrounding special looks for both the Rookie and The Conners. On Freeform, the cast fielded fans’ burning questions while on Univision, during the Santos Laguna vs Cruz Azul game, there was an in-Game feature with Zoe Saldana and Pratt.

	On April 1, a new TV spot debuted in the NCAA Final 4 game, announcing that tickets were going on sale on April 3. In support of the tickets on sale messaging, the day was filled with new content and art including a Fandango Cast Roundtable with Pratt, Karen Gillan, Sean Gunn and Gunn; exclusive partner one sheets (IMAX, Dolby, RealD, ScreenX, 4DX, and Fandango). Gunn also announced on social the soundtrack and tracklist poster.

GOTG3‘s  music campaign was the largest in the franchise and featured music from several decades in trailers, television spots, and digital activations. The 17-track soundtrack album was released on vinyl, CD, and collectible cassettes featuring nine unique character designs. The campaign included promotions such as the Target Media Wall at over 1,800 locations, TV spots, online ads, and outdoor in NYC Time Square. Additionally, a special fan event at Amoeba Music featured a live performance by Royston Langdon of Spacehog.

	One big music-related highlight: The “Knowhere Depot” Coachella activation which tapped into the festival’s zeitgeist as attendees were encouraged to stop at the pop-up during their drive. Billboards along the freeway gave the location, and the Knowhere Depot offered photo opportunities and free swag for festival goers. K-GOTG radio was also launched as the official Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 Spotify radio program.
Out in the desert? 🌵 Knowhere is waiting for you.  Stop by today before 6pm 🕕 for your last chance to visit.   13033 Malki Road Banning, CA 92220  #GotGVol3 pic.twitter.com/Zx5v4ZQ8tH

140,"Taylor Swift and Matty Healy 'Like Each Other,' Were Reconnected by Jack Antonoff, Sources Say | Entertainment Tonight",https://www.etonline.com/taylor-swift-and-matty-healy-like-each-other-were-reconnected-by-jack-antonoff-sources-say-204192,"Taylor Swift and Matty Healy have been spending time together and it was a mutual friend that reconnected them, ET has learned.
A source tells ET, ""Taylor and Matty like each other. Taylor has a crush on Matty and they are having a good time hanging out. Matty also thinks Taylor is awesome and incredibly talented, too. They dated briefly in the past.""
Another source tells ET, ""Taylor and Matty have been hanging out recently and Jack Antonoff reconnected them.""
Last month, the ""Anti-Hero"" singer was spotted grabbing dinner in New York City with her friend and longtime collaborator, Antonoff, and his fiancée, Margaret Qualley, just days after ET broke the news of Swift's split from boyfriend Joe Alwyn.
Videos and photos shared on social media showed Swift smiling as she stepped out for dinner with the couple at Via Carota restaurant in downtown Manhattan, just blocks away from Cornelia Street, which was the inspiration for one of Swift's songs on her Lover album -- fittingly named after the street where she once had a home -- and believed to be inspired by Alwyn.
""And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends / I’d never walk Cornelia Street again / That’s the kind of heartbreak time could never mend / I’d never walk Cornelia Street again,"" Swift sings on the 2019 track.
Swift and Antonoff have a history of working on music together and the Bleachers lead singer recently helped produce Being Funny in a Foreign Language, the fifth studio album by Healy's band, The 1975. 
Swift and Healy first met nearly 10 years ago and were briefly linked at the time, but Matty denied there was anything romantic between them.
In 2015, the British rock star addressed the romance rumors during a radio interview with Australia's 2DayFM. ""It's fake. It's all bloody fake. It's a farce!"" he said of reports that he was secretly seeing the pop star.
""We met each other, we exchanged numbers in the same way that a lot of people in this kind of world do, and we spoke occasionally,"" he said. ""She's the biggest pop star in the world and I'm in Australia. There's no relationship or anything happening. It's just funny how people really, really buy into that.""
Swift and The 1975 frontman were photographed in Nashville, Tennessee just after midnight on Sunday in the back of their chauffeured car before arriving at Swift's Nashville condo.
The photos come after Swift performed to a packed hometown crowd for the second night, where eagle-eyed fans were quick to notice one particular guest who sent them all into a frenzy.
The English pop star was spotted -- again -- having the time of his life during the concert at Nissan Stadium, belting out the lyrics to some of Swift's biggest hits. But Healy wasn't just there to watch -- he also performed with opening act Phoebe Bridgers. A video shared on social media shows Healy playing guitar to the sold-out stadium while wearing a skeleton suit.
MATTY HEALY IS PLAYING AT THE ERAS TOUR! Amid rumors that he’s dating Taylor Swift, The 1975’s lead singer joined @phoebebridgers on stage dressed as a skeleton on night two of the #ErasTourNashvillepic.twitter.com/DLU46l9Fpt
Healy's appearance at Saturday night's show comes after he attended Friday night's performance as well. Photographers spotted him like every other fan in the stadium Friday, snapping pics on his cell phone. There's also a video circulating on social media of him dancing the night away.
The new photos of the pair and his presence along the Nashville leg of the tour amplified speculation that he's dating Swift, though neither has commented on the matter. 
The pics also come just three weeks after Swift returned to the stage in Tampa, Florida, for the first time since ET exclusively revealed her split from Joe Alwyn.
A source previously told ET that their split was amicable and ""it was not dramatic."" ET had also learned that ""the relationship had just run its course"" and ""it's why [Alwyn hadn't] been spotted at any shows.""
""Taylor and Joe are in totally different places in their lives right now,"" a separate source told ET of the reason for the split. ""It was more of Taylor's decision to break up, but both of them realized that they weren't completely right for one another. They had been together for such a long time and were spending so much time together, but their personalities were just too different. Joe is more introverted, shy and quiet."" 
""She's very focused on touring and her career right now,"" the source added. ""Taylor has nothing but respect for Joe and really loved and enjoyed all the time and memories she shared with him. They had a deep connection and she really appreciated that. She hopes they can be friendly in the future."" 
In November, Healy revealed in an interview that The 1975 had planned to appear on Swift‘s latest album ‘Midnights’, but said the songs they worked on together ""never came out.""

141,Awkward MTV Movie & TV Awards reaffirms importance of writers,https://www.avclub.com/mtv-movie-tv-awards-reaffirm-importance-of-writers-1850414471,"The MTV Movie & TV Awards was a shell of its former self on Sunday. Literally: one of the first major casualties of the Writers Guild of America strike, the ceremony fell back on that tried and true sitcom method of transforming into a clip show of past moments rather than producing something new. It doesn’t make for a great awards show, but it does make a solid argument for the necessity of writers in the Hollywood ecosystem. 
That’s not simply because writers are the ones doing the writing (duh!). It’s also because the entertainment industry has fostered an environment of solidarity. Host Drew Barrymore pulled out of the proceedings in support of the strike (though several pre-taped bits still aired), and much of the talent reportedly dropped out even before Paramount decided to cancel the live event. Rather than test who was willing to cross the writers’ planned picket line, the network decided to throw in the towel altogether. 
Yet the not-live host-less 2023 edition couldn’t escape the specter of the strike, not least because some of its biggest stars expressed their support directly in taped acceptance speeches. The queens who accepted on behalf of RuPaul’s Drag Race emphasized the importance of advocating “for yourself and your worth” in their support of the strike, while Pedro Pascal spoke on behalf of The Last Of Us in stating “solidarity with the WGA, that is fighting very hard for fair wages.” 
But the most robust of these statements came from “Comedic Genius” winner Jennifer Coolidge. “Almost all great comedy starts with great writers. … As a proud member of [the Screen Actors Guild], I stand here before you tonight, side by side with my sisters and brothers from the WGA that are fighting right now, fighting for the rights of artists everywhere,” Coolidge said in her speech. “I think of the words of Shakespeare where he once said, ‘The play is the thing.’ Well, I don’t wanna put words in his mouth or anything, but I think what he really meant was, ‘It’s everything.’”
Like so many other flailing Hollywood institutions before it, the awards show tried to turn things around with a stunt from Tom Cruise in which he professed his passion for entertaining (and plugged Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part One) while flying a plane. But Cruise’s daredevil ways couldn’t cover up the fact that the night was MTV’s own Frankenstein’s monster, with new clips sewn together with old clips so as to be nearly indistinguishable. Even Barrymore’s most significant pre-taped bit relied on nostalgia (reprising her role as Josie Grossie in Never Been Kissed, something she’s done multiple times on her talk show, by the way) merged with pre-existing clips from the year’s biggest shows and movies. Without writers, there was nothing new—and by the way, without writers, we wouldn’t have any of that old stuff, either.
Kick back!This durable daybed lounger is super-durable. The finishing touch to your backyard.
It’s the first (though probably not the last) chance of the 2023 strike for audiences to see what Hollywood is like sans scribes. Flashy, maybe, with plenty of shiny faces, but ultimately an empty husk. In an environment where awards shows are already struggling to stay relevant, it’s obvious that the formula can’t survive without that key ingredient. ",1

Workout guru Denise Austin says that she feels just as fit now as she did in her 20s.
In a post shared this weekend, the fitness icon was wearing the exact same pink swimsuit she modeled in the 1990s.
She was on the beach with her blonde hair down as she looked phenomenal in both images - on the left she is seen in her thirties and on the right she was in her sixties.
The star - who was seen making a margarita on Cinco de Mayo -  said that she is just as confident now about her look as she was 30 years ago, which is an empowering statement.
'WOW!! what an incredible memory to look back on!' she began her Instagram caption.
Then and now works for her: Workout guru Denise Austin says that she feels just as fit now as she did in her 20s. In a post shared this weekend, the fitness icon was wearing the exact same pink swimsuit she modeled in the 1990s
'This Then and Now brings back such nostalgia,' added the California resident.
'I wore this suit back in the ‘90s while shooting my TV show!
'How many of you remember watching? I still feel as confident and fit as ever and love that I have this suit to remind me how far I’ve come!'
Austin then added, 'Longevity baby!! Thank you to everyone that has always supported me.. THEN and NOW!!!!xoxo.'
The exercise queen spoke to DailyMail.com last year about her figure.
The svelte star has told DailyMail.com that one of the ways to maintain a flat belly is to skip 'sugar substitutes.' 
She said that women over 50 need to try different foods. Foods high in fiber are a must, she noted. 
Stay clean: Last year the svelte star has told DailyMail.com that one of the ways to maintain a flat belly during the holidays it to skip 'sugar substitutes.' That means saying no to diet sodas and processed sweets that claim to be zero sugar
Easy plan: 'I have some tips that can help ease that feeling and keep your bloated belly at bay. Some are as simple as eating slower and to steer clear of sugar substitutes,' she said 
'Our 50s is when staying regular can become a challenge, so in addition to fiber-rich whole grains, begin to incorporate other fiber-rich foods such as beans and legumes, broccoli, berries and avocados,' she said.
She also recommends inflammation-fighting foods. 'Help minimize inflammation with the addition of turmeric, salmon, olive oil and even dark chocolate... these foods can also help to promote heart health and a healthy weight, when eaten in moderation!'
And her last tip is to consume plant-based protein. 'To help keep your heart healthy, at this point in your life you may want to begin to substitute in plant-based protein for animal protein, such as red meat. Consider a meat-free bean chili, tossing lentils into your salads, or fajitas with tofu instead of steak.'
As far as food, she told DailyMail.com she watches what she eats but keeps it delicious. And her portions are just right for shedding the pounds.
Take note! She also recommends inflammation-fighting foods. 'Help minimize inflammation with the addition of turmeric, salmon, olive oil and even dark chocolate... these foods can also help to promote heart health and a healthy weight, when eaten in moderation'
Still a hottie: Austin looked youthful in the small orange bikini top paired with small briefs as she added a white jacket while wearing her hair down
'I eat smaller portions,' Denise told DailyMail.com. 'For dinner I may have salmon and veggies. A snack is flax seed with yogurt. I love avocadoes and eggs for breakfast.
'I cook really healthy for my family. There are a lot of salads, chicken tacos, vegetable lasagnas, casseroles with less cheese.' 
But she is not always careful: 'I eat well 80 percent of the time and the other 20 percent I am bad.'
She is referring to the popular 80/20 diet method which allows for cheat days. Some of the things she loves to cheat with: carbs and sugar. 
And she also talked working out.         
The exercise proponent's answer to battling the bulge is by taking baby steps.
Still a stunner: And her last tip is to consume plant-based protein. 'To help keep your heart healthy, at this point in your life you may want to begin to substitute in plant-based protein for animal protein, such as red meat. Consider a meat-free bean chili, tossing lentils into your salads, or fajitas with tofu instead of steak'; seen in the 1980s
'I have been doing this for 40 years and am not a fitness nut,' she clarifies straight away during the interview. 'But I am consistent.'
That means working out every day in some form.
'If you can do 10 minutes of working out at a time and do that three times a day, you will have worked out 30 minutes in one day,' noted the star.
And she added that it is important to keep moving all day long: 'It is all about blood circulation and moving. I even stand up and walk in place when I watch TV just to keep it flowing.'
Sounds like smart math, and an easy way to lean into exercising.
'The consistency pays off,' added the affable pinup who is very active on Instagram.

143,WWE RAW preview: WWE RAW Preview: Predicting who will advance in the new World Heavyweight Championship Tournament,https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe/wwe-raw-preview-predicting-will-advance-new-world-heavyweight-championship-tournament,"Tonight's WWE RAW preview includes the beginning of the new World Heavyweight Championship tournament. 12 stars were already announced, with six participants battling it out on this week's RAW and SmackDown episodes. It's still unknown who the match-ups are, but here are a few possible predictions for the upcoming tournament.
Before Backlash, Triple H announced that two triple-threat matches would occur for both WWE RAW and SmackDown from this week onwards. Winners of each triple threat will then face later in the night, and the winners of each brand will compete at Night of Champions for the new title. For tonight, Cody Rhodes, Damian Priest, Finn Balor, Seth Rollins, Shinsuke Nakamura, and The Miz are set to compete.
The first likely triple threat for tonight involves Finn Balor vs. The Miz vs. Shinsuke Nakamura. The latter two already had an eventful encounter on a previous episode of the red brand. On the other hand, it would make sense to separate The Judgment Day members from each other.
The second triple-threat match for the night could be between Seth Rollins, Cody Rhodes, and Damian Priest. The Visionary and The American Nightmare share an intense past and will most likely revisit it tonight. As for Priest, it would be a good way to test him against the company's top stars.
As for who will emerge victorious, it could be Nakamura or Balor for the first match, while Rollins for the other. Shinsuke has just recently returned, and it's evident that fans haven't forgotten about him yet, while Finn never got the chance to prove himself as a worthy champion after having to relinquish the Universal Championship years prior. Rollins will mostly go out on top, as Rhodes may still continue to target Roman Reigns, while Damian still needs some time to build himself.
Aside from the long-awaited World Heavyweight Championship tournament, other superstars could be expected for tonight's WWE RAW with the Draft now taking full effect. Fans should definitely expect new feuds and storylines to begin from stars previously from SmackDown and NXT.
Tonight's WWE RAW episode will also feature the fallout of the recently concluded Backlash premium live event in Puerto Rico, there could still be a number of feuds to continue. Some of them involve The Bloodline against Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn, and there's also LWO and The Judgment Day.
It remains to be seen which superstars will be successful for tonight's episode and who will advance to Night of Champions.

One of the more harrowing reads for writers concerned about artificial intelligence encroaching on their livelihoods is a study commissioned by OpenAI itself. Published in March, it places writers in the “fully exposed” category. This means that, according to OpenAI, a large language model (LLM) could reduce the time it takes for them to carry out their work by at least 50 percent. AI can already score in the 93rd percentile on SAT reading exams; it can already produce bad stories and poems. Directors are discussing the possibilities of AI-generated scripts.
It’s no wonder, then, that the Writers Guild of America is demanding a greater say in how AI is used in Hollywood.
Chris Stokel-Walker

When WGA members began their picket on May 2, the first such strike in 15 years, focus was on streaming services’ impact on Hollywood and how the residuals paid to writers for streaming projects hadn’t kept pace with those of traditional broadcast shows and theatrical releases. But there was another demand: that the agreement with studios “regulate use of material produced using artificial intelligence or similar technologies.”
The Writers Guild isn’t alone in trying to figure out AI’s place in its industry. Artists, actors, musicians—people in all creative professions—are trying to wrest control of the technology before it is used against them. It’s a smart move. If the history of automation has demonstrated anything, it’s that leaving the implementation of new technologies up to management is a bad idea.
Over the phone, John August, a member of the WGA’s negotiating committee and writer of Charlie's Angels, explains that the proposal “says that material generated by AI or similar technologies is not considered literary material or source material for the purposes of the contract.” In this context, literary material refers to the stuff writers get paid to write: screenplays, treatments, outlines. Provisions over source material, on the other hand, seek to ensure that writers will not be asked to adapt AI-generated scripts—trained on human writers’ work—as they might with a novel. In both of those scenarios, writers’ employment and pay shrinks. The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers rejected this proposal, offering “annual meetings to discuss advancements in technology.”
With emerging tech, things rarely happen as advertised. This is particularly germane to LLMs, where the scope of possible ends still ranges from flash-in-the-pan productivity tools to society-upending sci-fi intelligence. Skeptics often bring up self-driving cars, baptized in hype a decade ago but still not flooding the roads or outmoding truck drivers.
Nonetheless, generative AI’s current trajectory conjures inescapable parallels with the encroachment of streaming services on the Hollywood system. August recalls that at the time of the 2007 WGA strike, the major streaming services hadn’t yet taken off. He had, however, begun to notice the stirrings of deep sea change, portended by innovations like spin-off “webisodes” of The Office being thrown onto the internet.
“We saw that this might be the next way that companies would be able to make money off of our work,” he says. “So that strike was largely about making sure that, no matter what the medium was, our content still was paid for upfront in a fair way and paid for in the back end through residuals. We didn’t know what streaming was going to become. But we knew the internet was going to be the future.”

There’s a long history of management painting automation as something as inevitable as sunrise. It’s an echoing pattern, one the late historian of technology David F. Noble summarized in Forces of Production, his account of the implementation of machine tools in America. “‘Automatic’ or ‘self-acting’ machinery made it possible for management both to eliminate workers altogether and to control more directly the production process,” he wrote. “The machinery, in turn, was used to discipline and pace the operators who attended it, thereby reducing the “labor problem” indirectly via the seeming requirements of the technology of production itself.”
Power and Progress: Our Thousand-Year Struggle Over Technology and Prosperity, a book from MIT economists Daron Acemoglu and Simon Johnson that’s due out next month, chronicles a thousand years of elites—from European nobles in the Middle Ages to modern-day tech CEOs—gaining from technological advancements at the expense of workers. Generative AI fits neatly into this historical context. “We argue that this obsession with machine intelligence is not helpful because it’s all about replacing people,” Johnson explains. “Whereas if you focus on making machines useful to people—nurses, doctors, teachers, and so on—that will be much more helpful to productivity and therefore, potentially, to pay.”
Futures range in awfulness. August’s personal dystopia is what he calls the Nora Ephron scenario, where AI learns to mimic cultural titans, eclipsing new human writers. Studios likely won’t employ AI scabs during this strike, not least because having AI tools cross the picket line introduces a host of copyright issues, but it’s not hard to imagine that this could happen at one point. (“You cannot protect studio execs from their bad ideas,” he says.)
And then there is the most likely bad scenario, the one worth getting out in front of right now: a producer requesting that a writer edit a script (which pays less than producing an original work) and not telling them it was generated by a chatbot. “That’s a crisis in our compensation, it’s a crisis in our residuals, and a crisis in our artistic ability to do the things we are put in this industry to do,” says August. “So that’s a fundamental nightmare scenario. And that feels very obvious if we don’t get this resolved.”
More positive outcomes include improved productivity, like moving from a typewriter to a word processor. Commentators are unsure, however, whether that increase in productivity will lead to tangible improvements, like an increased standard of living. ChatGPT is already useful for brainstorming: If you need 15 different names for a Mandarin bagel shop, as August puts it, AI does an alright job. And he sees a possibility that the tech could create opportunities for more diverse writers, improving the scripts of someone for whom English is not their first language, for instance.
Automation and redundancy are not necessarily conjoined, and introducing disruptive technology—like the self-checkout machine—is a choice. There are examples of times when worker perspectives on new technologies, not just those of management, have been successfully taken into account. In their book, Acemoglu and Johnson cite West Coast longshoremen who demanded to be retrained in new technology. They won, leading to a reduction in job losses and an increase in productivity. Katya Klinova, head of Al, labor, and the economy at the Partnership on AI, points to Unite Here, which represents hospitality workers, who in 2018 successfully won the right to negotiate how Marriott plans to bring in new technology, like online services, computers, and even robots.
Digital technologies are inherently isolating: They do not lead people into factories to discuss concerns with their fellow workers. The efforts of a union with the relative power of WGA trying to assert control over AI implementation are instructive for everyone. For the writers, it’s critical: Their contract is only up for negotiation every three years. That’s a long time in tech. “You know, in 2007, streaming wasn’t there yet. But by 2010, you started to see those inklings,” says August. “In 2023, AI is not replacing us—AI is not being used to write exactly what we’re doing. But by 2026, the next time this contract is up, it really feels like that technology will be very refined. We need to make sure that this is addressed.”

149,How Michelin Guide awards stars to restaurants | Boing Boing,https://boingboing.net/2023/05/08/how-michelin-guide-awards-stars-to-restaurants.html,"Ever wondered how the Michelin Guide dishes out stars to restaurants? CBS Sunday Morning takes a peek behind the scenes by talking to a Michelin-rated chef, an anonymous restaurant inspector, and the Guide's international director Gwendal Poullennec. The Michelin Guide, first published by the French tire manufacturer in 1900, awards stars to restaurants based on specific criteria: the quality of the products, mastery of cooking techniques, harmony and balance in flavors, the personality of the chef as expressed on the plate, and consistency over time and throughout the menu.
Michelin still sells tires. But, said [Gwendal] Poullennec, ""The ones making the tires are not the professional anonymous inspectors eating out in the restaurants every day.""
Today, international teams of inspectors review restaurants in countries around the world, including the U.S., with guides in Washington, California, New York, Chicago, and (as of last year) Florida. 
Sanneh asked, ""So the idea is, while you're driving around on our car tires, here are some places you might stop for a meal?""
""One star is worth a stop,"" said Poullennec. ""Two stars worth a detour, and three stars worth a special journey.""
Restaurants often brag about having a Michelin star (or two, or three). There are only about 140 three-star restaurants worldwide, 13 of them in the United States.

Newly crowned monarchs popped into a recording for the US talent competition 
Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile
King Charles III and Queen Camilla made an unexpected addition to their royal engagements over the weekend with a cameo slot on American Idol. 
The freshly crowned monarchs gave viewers of the long-running singing competition show a surprise on Sunday (7 May) when they took part in a pre-recorded segment. 
American Idol judges Katy Perry and Lionel Richie were absent from their positions on the show as they were in the UK to perform at the Coronation Concert. 
Still, they dropped in via video recording to share their well-wishes from Windsor Castle, when they were joined by Charles and Camilla. 
After Richie addressed the audience about their absence, the King and Queen entered the shot.
“I just wanted to check how long you'd be using this room for?” the King asked with a laugh. 
After curtseying, Perry asked the Queen whether they’d been making too much noise, to which she responded no.

Reactions to the surprise segment noted that Perry was particularly excited in the close presence of Charles and Camilla.
“Katy was a bit tongue-tied. You could tell she was in a glorious moment,” one viewer commented.
Another person wrote: “Awww, what a treat! Lovely from King Charles and Queen Camilla.”

Others commented on the bit as part of the coronation weekend in general. “That was so cute,” wrote one fan. “I watched the coronation, it was so beautiful, I love watching history happen right in front of my eyes.”
The cameo didn’t go down well with everyone though. One person tweeted: “That seemed so awkward and weird to me,” while others deemed the short clip “cringe”. 
On Sunday (7 May), Perry and Richie were some of the headline performers at the concert.
Richie performed his hits “Easy Like Sunday Morning” and “All Night Long” before Perry took to the stage with “Roar” and “Firework”.

152,Prince William tells King Charles the late Queen Elizabeth would be 'proud' | CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/08/uk/coronation-concert-prince-william-scli-intl-ckc-gbr/index.html,"
      Prince William paid tribute to his “Pa” King Charles III at the coronation concert on Sunday, saying “we are all so proud of you” as he evoked the memory of the late Queen Elizabeth II.
  

      “I know she is up there fondly keeping an eye on us and she would be a very proud mother,” said the Prince of Wales at the event held on the grounds of Windsor Castle. He added that his grandmother had called coronations a “declaration of our hopes for the future.”
  

      The coronation concert capped a day of street parties and community lunch events across the UK in celebration of King Charles III. 
  

      The concert line-up was certainly fit for a King, featuring global superstars, classical music maestros and an eclectic mix of celebrity faces, from Tom Cruise to “The Muppets’” very own Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy.
  

      William kicked off his speech on a humorous note, making a promise to the crowd that, unlike singer Lionel Richie, who performed at the event, he wouldn’t “go on all night long” with his address.
  

      Instead, William said he simply wanted to “say a few words about my father and why I believe this weekend is so important.”
  

      He went on to pay a heartfelt tribute to the King, outlining his commitment to service over the years.
  

      “For all that celebrations are magnificent, at the heart of the pageantry is a simple message: Service. My father’s first words on entering Westminster Abbey yesterday were a pledge of service,” Prince William remarked.
  

      “It was a pledge to continue to serve. Because for over 50 years, in every corner of the UK, across the Commonwealth and around the world, he [King Charles] has dedicated himself to serve others, both current and future generations, and those whose memory must not be neglected,” the prince continued.
  

      William highlighted the King’s commitment to environmental causes, saying the King “warned us of the risks to our planet’s health long before it was an everyday issue.”
  

Prince Harry is already back in the US after quick coronation appearance


      He also commended the King’s charitable contributions through his foundation, the Prince’s Trust, which William said “has supported over a million young people, many from disadvantaged backgrounds, to realize their ambitions.”
  

      “Pa, we are all so proud of you,” the prince said, addressing the King directly.
  

      Prince William wrapped up his brief speech by thanking the “millions of people who serve in the forces, in classrooms, hospital wards and local communities,” giving his own pledge to “serve [them] all.”
  

      King Charles III was crowned at Westminster Abbey in London on Saturday, and well-wishers packed the streets of the British capital.
  

      After the service, the King and selected members of the royal family made the customary appearance on the Buckingham Palace balcony, but a flypast of military aircraft was scaled back due to bad weather.
  

      Police arrested dozens of people during the coronation, after controversially promising a “robust” approach to protesters.

By Ruby Miranda — Written on May 08, 2023
Three zodiac signs have rough weekly horoscopes May 8 - 14, 2023, and just to be clear, everything you read here is not only original content written for you by your hard-working Ruby, the Astro-loving blogger-deluxe, but all the doom and gloom that is promised for three signs of the zodiac this week is not even the slightest bit inspired by artificial intelligence.
In other words, zodiac signs, what you get in these blogs is good old-fashioned, heartfelt WORK. I am a real person, and I'm doing real work for you, and the reason I mention all of this is so that you know you are in the right place when you come to read these blogs. Additionally, this week will bring up this kind of existential thinking for many of us.
The week of May 8 - 14, is chock full of transits that will play with our sense of existence; there will be worry, and there will be paranoia, but one thing many of us will see happening during this week is the constant appearance of an adversary, meaning, no matter what we do or where we go, there will be someone there to contradict what we say.
We are going to share space with many planets that are in opposition, and Pluto makes a marked entry halfway through the week, which, in its way, enforces that things stay negative. We will fight it, oh yes ... we will 'fight the system,' even though we are fighting the good fight this week, we will see many depressing fails.

Three zodiac signs will take the lineup of transits the hardest. We're looking at the negative effects of Moon square Neptune, Moon opposite Venus, Moon opposite Mars (of all planets, yikes!), Moon conjunct Pluto, Mercury sextile Saturn on the 12 — which will NOT be fun, and Venus trine Saturn at week's end. All of this spells trouble, and with a Final Quarter Moon in Aquarius in our midst, many of us will stand up for our rights, only to see our rights squashed like a bug right before our eyes. Who's about to see a very rough week?
(June 21 - July 22)
This week will bring up many new topics for you to mull over, and so many of these subjects will perplex and anger you. You may wonder if you will keep your job or if somehow there's someone ... or something in your life that will sabotage everything you've worked so hard to achieve. The news that is taking place in the world right now is getting under your skin, and you can't help but admit to yourself that you are somewhat worried. With all those lunar transits, you, Cancer, can't help but feel like you are being made to witness something you'd rather hide your eyes from.
On a personal note, you'll be taken aback during the week of May 8 - 14 by something that affects your love life; your partner hasn't been completely honest with you, and while that doesn't necessarily lead to doom, you may overthink it until it does. Be careful how you let your mind wander during this week, Cancer. Perception is everything.

(December 22 - January 19)
There are moments you will experience during the week of May 8 - 14, that will be nothing short of what you could call an existential crisis. To be clear, what is an existential crisis? It's when we ask, ""What is the meaning of life?"" And ""Do I exist?"" Heavy, yes, but once you drop into that rabbit hole, the paranoia and frights come flying in fast and furious. With your Capricorn tendency to see the glass as half empty, this week may bring you so much more negativity of mind than you thought you could hold.
Communications are off for you this week, and you'll be spending a lot of time analyzing what's going on in your life, which means a lot of time spent alone in your head. During the Half-Moon in Aquarius, you may see yourself flip to a more positive viewpoint, as your response to your questions will be more along the lines of the fight rather than flight. Stay strong, Capricorn ... do your thing your way.

(February 19 - March 20)
You are looking at a week filled with self-analysis, which may lead to self-doubt. You've been reviewing some old memories, and in the same way that one would throw out their trash, you have also decided which memories are worth keeping and which are simply garbage and not worthy of your time. In this reflective state, you'll be working with Neptune energy, which may result in spending too much time on something you thought you were rid of.
This week will bring you regression. You aim to succeed and get past certain things, yet you may find that all you're doing is digging deeper into the rut you wanted to escape. Uranus' energy works in tandem with the Aquarius Quarter Moon and may give you some hope in the form of rebellion. Expect the unexpected this week, Pisces.

Iam Tongi returned to the American Idol stage with a sweet Top 8 performance dedicated to his mother. 
Tongi chose to sing Alanis Morissette’s “Guardian” in honor of his mom. Morissette, who was serving as a guest judge for the episode, also took time to mentor the contestants.   
“This song was initially written about my own inner parent talking with all these parts in here and then the chorus was about my son. So kind of turning it around,” she said. 
Morissette admitted she got emotional during Iam’s performance of the song. 
“Me listening to Iam sing it as though I was his mom brought me to tears because he has this presence of power and yet also has this beautiful vulnerability. If any of my children sang that song to me, I would be a mess. I would love to hear you split it up into three parts. The very, very intimate, the middle and then that full-blown.”
The contestant was grateful for Morissette’s guidance and advice.  
“Running through the dynamics of the song, it was hard for me. I don’t really know how to go big, but she helped me a lot,” he said, adding “I really want to make Alanis proud, but I mostly want to make my mom proud because this song is about her to her.” 
“I think there’s a potential for Iam to have a really sweet moment here,” Morissette added prior to his performance.

As his mother and his siblings watched on from the crowd, Tongi delivered a moving performance of “Guardian.” 
At the conclusion of the performance, the live audience began chanting his name. 
The judges, including Luke Bryan, and guest judges Alanis Morissette and Ed Sheeran were completely enamored with Iam Tongi’s performance.   
“You took what we shared and brainstormed together to a whole other level and your level of empathy… first that you’re singing it to your mom, I mean, I can’t even. Just the empathy in your voice, you have this velvety voice and the planet I believe needs empathy now more than ever and you’re being this and you’re showing up here and showing the planet what it looks like to live and perform from empathy is such a huge gift,” Morissette shared. 
Ed Sheeran praised Tongi’s ability to connect with the audience.  
“I just felt like you really connected with the song and that makes us as listeners connect with it. It was just really, really beautiful,” he said. 
Bryan’s comments were short, simple, and to the point. “Great job man, you just always light the room up and it’s obvious when you do,” he said.
Earlier in the show, Tongi joined Oliver Steele for a performance of Ed Sheeran’s “Photograph.” 
“Just how well your voices compliment each other. It was so beautiful to listen to like your vocal tones fit so well with each other. I know that both of you have like… I’m listening to it knowing that there’s a crazy power singing ability that’s in there, but just gentleness and soulfulness you’re bringing… I got emotional listening to that, it was good,” he said. 
Morisette then addressed the pair. “Iam and Oliver, I just know you’re coming from two completely different places and yet you have this really cohesive respective connection with each other. I was just really moved and hearing men be vulnerable is… be still my beating heart,” she admitted. 
Bryan praised the contestants’ “beautiful harmonies” and complimented the overall performance. 
Iam Tongi ultimately earned a spot in the Top 5.
Ed Sheeran and Alanis Morissette are temporarily replacing Katy Perry and Lionel Richie while they are in England performing as part of the Coronation Celebration for King Charles III. 
“I can’t wait to guide you through this stage of the competition and career and yeah this is the first time I’ve done this on American Idol, I can’t wait to take the iconic American Idol stage,” Sheeran previously shared. “Mostly, I’m just looking forward to meeting all of you and talking through life and music and I hope you’re having a great time and I’ll see you very, very soon. Lots of love.”
“I am so excited to be mentoring and hearing your interpretations of my songs. I can’t wait to hear them and surprise I’m going to be guest judging with Luke as well. So I can’t wait to see you,” Morissette previously added.
Perry and Richie made a brief appearance during Idol with a video from Windsor Castle.
American Idol airs every Sunday and Monday at 8/7c via ABC.

156,‘American Idol’ 2023: Who made the top 5? Who are the top 5 singers? - Deseret News,https://www.deseret.com/2023/5/7/23714934/american-idol-2023-top-5-singers,"Iam Tongi performs on “American Idol.” On Sunday night, “Idol” revealed that Tongi has made the top five. 
ABC
“American Idol” has officially cut the competition down to five singers. 
On Sunday night, the show eliminated three contestants and revealed the top five singers this season. Here’s a look at who remains in the competition.
Congrats on being in the Top 5, @ZachariahSmith , @megandanielle, @wtongi , @wemusic  and @ColinStough! See y’all next week. #Idol

Iam Tongi’s “American Idol” audition is the most viewed of the season — by a landslide. Posted just over two months ago, it already has 15 million views on YouTube. For his audition, 18-year-old Tongi, who is from Hawaii, performed “Monsters” by James Blunt and dedicated the performance to his father, who died a couple of months before the audition. 
With emotion, Tongi told the “Idol” judges that his father was the reason he got into music. He carried his emotion into his performance, and had judges Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan crying with his rendition of the song.
Tongi choked up as he reached his last note — but he had already convinced the judges that he would be a strong contender in the “Idol” competition.
“You hit a nerve, and that’s what great storytellers do,” Katy Perry said. “That’s what great artists do, and your voice is just so magnificent.” 
“I cannot handle your heart breaking about your dad,” Bryan added. “Just seeing you missing your dad just sucks. Gosh, man, you just got a great voice. ... You just did everything perfect, and I love you.” 
“You take this into the world and you’re going to fracture some souls,” Richie said. 
After the audition, Tongi spoke with producers about how he and his dad bonded over music, and how his dad had long wanted him to audition for “American Idol.” 
“People thought I cry because I miss him, but it’s ’cause I hear him singing — I can hear his harmony,” Tongi said. “I know he’s with me. Through my music he’ll always be with me.”

Megan Danielle, a 20-year-old singer from Georgia, got the surprise of a lifetime when she auditioned for “Idol” with Lauren Daigle’s “You Say”: Daigle, who previously competed on “Idol,” ended up joining her audition and singing along.
During her audition, Danielle, who works at a Southern restaurant with her mom, told the “Idol” judges that she had a band when she was 18 and would frequently perform in bars. But one day, she said, her grandfather pulled her aside and asked her how she could use her talent to serve God, and the singer decided to make a switch to performing Christian music. 
With Daigle at her side, Danielle received feedback from the judges, who praised her authenticity. Bryan, specifically, said Danielle had “a real honest rawness.” 
Danielle previously competed on “The Voice,” getting eliminated during the semifinals on Season 18.

From a small town in Mississippi, 18-year-old Colin Stough made it to the “Idol” judges for one main reason: His mom signed him up to audition for the show.
Stough — who hopes to put the small town of Gattman, Mississippi, on the map — wowed all of the judges with his rendition of Lynyrd Skynyrd’s “Simple Man.” His mom, who was standing outside of the room during the performance, then came in and told the judges a little more about her son. She said Stough asked for his first guitar when he was in the fifth grade — and now their house is overflowing with guitars. 
All of the judges thanked Stough’s mother for signing her son up. 
“Colin is exactly what we hope and dream for at ‘American Idol,’” Bryan said. “Somebody that’s just raw, real, humble.”

We Ani’s high speaking voice gives off the impression that she could make a living doing voiceovers for Disney. Which is why all of the “Idol” judges were shocked when the singer from Harlem, New York, began to sing Demi Lovato’s “Anyone” in a rich, deep voice. 
“Way to throw the curve ball,” Perry said before all of the judges pushed the singer through to the next round without any hesitation.
Previously, Ani competed on Season 11 of “The Voice,” where she joined Team Alicia Keys’ team following chair turns from all four coaches during her blind audition. She placed third on the show that season. 

Zachariah Smith — who is from the same area of Mississippi as fellow “Idol” contestant Stough — performed an energetic rendition of John Mellencamp’s “Hurts so Good” for his audition. The 19-year-old singer couldn’t stop smiling during his performance, and won all of the judges over with his stage presence. 
“You have a rasp, you have a growl, and then on top of it you’re having so much fun,” Richie said. 

Singers Haven Madison, Oliver Steele and Warren Peay were eliminated Sunday night. “American Idol” resumes May 14 with a Disney-themed night.

	In her first public appearance since moving to Miami last month, Shakira gave an emotional speech to accept Billboard’s first Woman of the Year award at the inaugural Latin Women in Music gala, thanking her mother, her friends and women overall.

	Speaking to a crowd that regularly roared in approval at Miami’s Watsco Center, Shakira — dressed in a fitted short, black dress — was as sincere in her words as she’s been in her recent songs.

	“It’s true that when I felt most lost, music put me in the road back to myself,” she said, speaking to over 2,000 in attendance at the May 6 gala (which aired tonight on Telemundo and Peacock), in a clear allusion to her recent public breakup with soccer star Gerard Piqué. “But the most important lessons I learned from other women, and for them I wrote what I wrote and I sang what I sang. Because only a woman can love until she’s ripped apart; can speak with the most brutal honesty; can sing with anger; dance in ecstasy and be brought to tears with emotion. Only a woman can do that.”

	










	But it was all about celebrating the global superstar at Billboard’s Women in Music. The Colombian star has achieved new heights with the biggest Spanish-language debut of 2022 (“Monotonía” featuring Ozuna) and broke 14 Guinness World Records with her “Shakira: BZRP Music Sessions #53,” which debuted at No. 9 on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart, making her the first woman to reach the top 10 on the chart with a song in Spanish.

	Fellow Colombian star Maluma pointed those records out when he came out to present Shakira, whom he referred to as a friend.

	“I’ve seen firsthand that Shakira writes her songs from the heart and her experiences, and this year she was able to turn adversity into art, emotions and pain into music, and made history with her lyrics, creating a hit that today is a universal feminine anthem: Women don’t cry, women cash in!” he said to thunderous applause.

	The standing ovation, however, was for the Woman of the Year. Read Shakira’s full acceptance speech below.
A post shared by billboard (@billboard)

This has been a year of seismic change in my life where I’ve felt more than ever and very personally what it is to be a women. And what it means.











It’s been a year where I’ve realized we women are stronger than we think, braver than we believed, more independent than we were taught to be.

Because what woman hasn’t at some time in her life forgotten herself because she’s seeking the attention and love of someone else?

It happened to me, more than once.

But there comes a time in the life of every woman where she no longer depends on someone else to love and accept herself just as she is.

A time when the search for someone else is replaced by the search for oneself. A time when the desire to be perfect is replaced by the desire to be authentic, and where finding someone who is faithful is less important than being faithful to ourselves.

It’s true that when I felt most lost, music put me in the road back to myself. But the most important lessons I learned from other women, and for them I wrote what I wrote and I sang what I sang. Because only a woman can love until she’s ripped apart; can speak with the most brutal honesty; can sing with anger; dance in ecstasy and be brought to tears with emotion. Only a woman can do that.

And there is one special woman who has inspired me more than anyone else: my mother, Nidya Ripoll. Mami, despite the hardships you’ve faced this year, you’re still standing with limitless love and resilience. You, mami, have been my woman of the year. So, this recognition is for you, and also for my friends who have supported me and who hold me up when my legs give out. And for all those single moms who defend and protect their children like lionesses. Claudia, I love you! You’re one of those.

I receive this honor with lots of love, but for me, more than celebrating the women of the year, we should celebrate the year of the woman. A year where us women have touched subjects that couldn’t be touched, and said things that couldn’t be said. And though some may have complained, there’s no going back. Together, we’ve taken a step forward, and with each step we’re more free and more fulfilled.











Thank you for this recognition, and I share it with those incredible women I call ‘sisters’ who have taught me so much because they understand their own vulnerability, but also their own strength.

Chris Brown appears to have spoken out about a reported altercation at his birthday party on Friday night that involved Usher.
In an Instagram comment that was apparently from Brown, 34, and reposted by a Twitter fan account, he appeared to deny that anything had happened between him and 44-year-old singer.
Brown and Usher had been seen appearing to have a tense argument at a skating rink in Las Vegas, Nevada, according to a video obtained by TMZ.
Video obtained by the outlet also appeared to show another incident involving Brown backstage at Missy Elliotts set for the Lovers & Friends music festival, where both he and Usher performed separate sets the night after the incident that allegedly left Usher with a bloody nose.
DailyMail.com has reached out to representatives for both Usher and Brown for comment. 
Denial: Chris Brown, 34, appears to have denied an alleged altercation with Usher over the weekend that left the 44-year-old singer with a bloodied nose; seen Saturday in Las Vegas
Ouch: Although it's not clear if Brown or any of his entourage attacked Usher, eyewitnesses claimed to have seen the latter returning with facial injuries after chasing down Brown when he left the skating rink where his party was being held in a rage; seen Saturday in Las Vegas
In his comment, Brown wrote, '.yall been geeked all weekend , y'all dragging it now. It was mad people backstage and security was trying to clear everyone off the stage. People started pushing back.. I INTERVENED To let them know MY CHILD WAS BACK THERE. So y'all can keep ya narrative.' 
His first sentence appeared to allude to the alleged confrontation with Usher, as it indicated an earlier point of contention.
The latest footage of Brown from the festival, obtained by TMZ, appears to show him shouting at security team members and trying to push forward even as a line of them try to keep him from advancing.
It's not clear what he says in the video, as several other people are also shouting and jostling around him.
However, he does seem to be pointing toward something or someone behind the line of security guards, which would seem to support his claim that he was trying to reach one of his children as the guards attempted to clear the area.
Brown has three children: Royalty, eight, whom he shares with Nia Guzman; Aeko, three, whom he shares with Ammika Harris; and one-year-old Lovely, whom he welcomed with Diamond Brown.
Despite the alleged altercation that led witnesses to claim Usher suffered a bloodied nose, he was still in good enough shape to perform on Saturday night.
He wore sunglasses for much of the performance, though he did remove them at times, and he also posted a clip of his face in closeup to social media, indicating that he had no obvious lacerations or significant swelling.
One thing after another: His first sentence appeared to allude to the alleged confrontation with Usher, as it indicated an earlier point of contention
Details: Brown was seen in video shouting and pushing against security at Missy Elliott's set during the Loves & Friends festival, but he claimed he trying to reach one of his children; seen Saturday
Nothing too serious: Usher spent much of his set wearing sunglasses, but he did remove them at some points. He didn't have any obvious lacerations and no significant swelling; seen Saturday
Getting physical: Brown and Usher reportedly got into an altercation that was said to have become violent during the former's 34th birthday party on Friday night
Setting the scene: Usher had thrown a birthday party for Brown at a skating rink in Las Vegas
However, he has not explicitly denied the claims that he suffered a bloody nose. 
The alleged conflict at Brown's birthday party seemingly came out of nowhere, as Usher had been hosting the party for his friend. 
Insiders stated that the No Guidance singer became incensed after he attempted to speak to Teyana Taylor, who was also present at the event, and she chose to ignore him completely.
A source spoke to Hollywood Unlocked, where the news about the incident was originally revealed, and expressed that the performer was 'disrespectful' to the actress during the party.
The insider also remarked that Brown was 'intoxicated' when he initially approached the 32-year-old singer.
Several sources spoke to lovebscott.com and expressed that the singer was upset about how his planned Michael Jackson tribute at the American Music Awards was canceled at the last minute.
Taylor was reportedly involved with the planned performance and ended up pulling out not long before the show, which caused the project to fall apart.
After she was approached by Brown, the singer remarked that he was 'on one' in an apparent reference to his intoxication, and he responded by asking Usher to make her leave his birthday party. 
When the U Got It Bad singer reportedly attempted to mediate the situation, the rapper allegedly called him a 'coward' and exited the roller rink with his entourage.
The performer was said to have then followed his friend to the venue's parking lot in order to discuss the situation and calm him down.
However, a source spoke to lovebscott and expressed that 'CB [Chris Brown] and his crew beat Usher's a**.'
Reasoning: Insiders stated that the No Guidance singer became incensed after he attempted to speak to Teyana Taylor, who was also present at the event, and she chose to ignore him completely
Heated: When Usher reportedly attempted to intervene and separate the artists, the rapper allegedly called him a 'coward' and exited the roller rink with his entourage
Alleged altercation: The performer was said to have then followed his friend to the venue's parking lot in order to discuss the situation and calm him down, although the Burn singer later exited the lot with what appeared to be a bloody nose; they are seen in 2007
Tentative plans: The two are both scheduled to perform during the Lovers & Friends festival, which is set to kick off on Saturday; they are seen in 2015
Better times: Usher also brought out Brown during a show that took place in Las Vegas last year and embraced him on stage before presenting him with flowers; they are seen in 2016

The performer was said to have been left with a bloodied nose and bruised ribs following the incident.
According to TMZ, it was unknown if Usher was admitted to a hospital following the alleged beatdown or if police had been contacted.
The media outlet reached out to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, although no incidents resembling the supposed encounter had been reported as of late.
Neither Brown nor Usher have made any public comments about the alleged incident as of yet. 
Taylor, who was once a friend of Brown, has since unfollowed him on Instagram. 
Usher has since confirmed that he will appear at the Lovers & Friends festival, which is scheduled to take place later today.
Sources spoke to TMZ and stated that the hitmaker would perform while recovering from the alleged attack.
Lovebscott's sources also expressed that Brown, who was also scheduled to appear at the festival, would go on with his performance as planned. 
Staying quiet: Neither Brown nor Usher have made any public comments about the alleged incident as of yet; they are seen in 2016
Taking it in stride: Usher has since confirmed that he will appear at the Lovers & Friends festival, which is scheduled to take place later today; he is seen with Brown in 2014
The pair have previously collaborated on several tracks, including New Flame, which was released in 2014, and Party, which debuted two years later. 
The My Way singer was featured in Welcome to My Life, a documentary focused on the life and career of his friend. 
Usher also brought out Brown during a show that took place as part of the former's residency in Las Vegas last year and embraced him on stage before presenting him with flowers.
He also told his friend via Hollywood Unlocked: 'You a great. You're a legend. We love you and we gonna continue to keep lifting you up, bro.'

The Hollywood Reporter checks in with the Lukas Matsson actor ahead of the HBO drama's final episodes.

[This story contains spoilers for the seventh episode of Succession season four, “Tailgate Party.”]

	As a wise man lost on a strange island once said: “The numbers are bad!” If Waystar Royco co-CEOs Kendall (Jeremy Strong) and Roman (Kieran Culkin) weren’t set on tanking the sale to streaming and tech giant GoJo before, they certainly have all the incentive they need now: purchaser Lukas Mattson (Alexander Skarsgård) is lying about his company’s subscriber numbers, in ways that only make sense if a second India exists. 



	The bomb goes off in “Tailgate Party,” set on the eve of Election Day. Kendall, Roman and sister Shiv (Sarah Snook) honor their late father‘s previously planned party, assembling many of the top movers and shakers of the United States, politicians and industrialists alike. For her part, Shiv’s secretly whispering in Matsson’s ear, angling to undermine her brothers and wrest away company control into her own hands. But in that effort, while introducing Matsson to the individuals he’ll rub up against in the world where he acquires Waystar, word starts circulating that the man’s subscriber numbers are radically inflated, to the point that Kendall’s new plan involved buying GoJo, rather than selling.

	First appearing in season three’s “Too Much Birthday,” Matsson was initially envisioned as a two-episode role for Skarsgård. Instead, Succession faces down the barrel of its final few episodes with Matsson as the final boss for Kendall, Roman and Shiv to clear. Ahead, The Hollywood Reporter checks in with the actor about embodying the tech giant, his strengths and weaknesses, and all the blood in the water beyond the liters he’s sending to his colleagues. 

You were a Succession fan before you joined the cast. When you first signed up and started shooting season three, could you see the path for Matsson’s deep involvement in the endgame?

	No, not at all. When my agent called, they mentioned that it was two episodes. I have a hard time following shows, between work and travel. At the time, Succession was probably the only show I was watching religiously. When new episodes dropped, I would always watch them. I was a fan of Jesse Armstrong from Peep Show, and I thought the writing, the acting and everything about Succession was so spectacular. So when they reached out, I didn’t need to read a script. If they’d wanted me to come on as an extra, I would have done it.

	










It’s like when actors play stormtroopers on Star Wars just to get on set.

	Kind of! It just looked like all the actors were having so much fun. I didn’t know anyone on the show, but from watching, I thought it looked like the dream gig. Not only are they extremely talented, but the writing is just so spectacular. Everything about it. Going into it, I was thrilled to play just for a few days. But then, we wrapped season three, and based on how it ended, clearly there was a way for Matsson to return, but we hadn’t discussed it creatively. I was only supposed to do those two episodes, and it ended up being three. I didn’t know until the beginning of last year when Jesse called and asked me back, and explained to me a bit about the storyline, and how Matsson was coming into it and the role he would play in the structure of it all. 

	He also mentioned the blood bricks. That got me salivating.

Oh! That’s part of the initial pitch? I might have said, “Jesse, you had me until ‘blood bricks.'”

	Oh, it was quite the opposite. Not that he didn’t already have me! Because like I said, watching the show, it looked like a dream, and then being on the show, it was better than I could have imagined. It really was one of the greatest and most creatively fulfilling jobs I’ve had, from people behind the camera and on. So of course I wanted to come on, but it did not make me any less excited when Jesse said, “There might be an ex-girlfriend he keeps sending frozen bricks of his blood to.” (Laughs.) I said, “Ooh, that’s delicious.”

	










“Do I have to film any of that?”

	I wish! That’ll be season five.

Don’t tease us with a good time. We’re learning more about Matsson in this episode, with the inflated numbers in India. There’s some question about whether he’s actually this once-in-a-lifetime talent or if he’s basically a PR creation. For you, when you tap into Matsson, what’s the balance between his genius and his incompetence? 

	He’s definitely a bull in a china shop. He subscribes to the philosophy “move fast and break things.” He’s an agent of chaos. He loves it. He’s not a PR-created … there’s nothing fake about him. If you want to call it “genius,” he’s just so out there and chaotic. He moves at such a high clip, and is so relentless and so unafraid, that he’s a tsunami of energy and ideas. He struck gold years ago, creating something that everyone wanted. It made him a gazillionaire. It also gave him a lot of leverage to move even faster and break even more things. When you have that much money and you have that much weight to throw around, some things work and some things don’t. But that’s fine, just because of the arsenal of weapons you have at your disposal. It makes him an 800-pound gorilla. He can throw a lot of money at something. There’s a fearlessness that’s benefited him in his career. He’s ruthless. There’s something about the chaos he creates that excites him. That’s why this whole deal with Waystar excites him. It’s thrilling. It’s not about the money for him anymore. He’s beyond wealthy. It’s the excitement of big shit happening.

	










Last week, Kendall makes the price-rocket play, and this week, we find out Matsson’s similarly inflating some critical numbers. The two men go toe-to-toe near the end of this episode, and it struck me how similar they are in some important ways. Do you think Matsson sees Kendall as an equal at all, or no chance?

	I think there are definite similarities. But deep down, there’s something about the nepotism that bothers him about all of the Roy kids. He really doesn’t think they would be where they are without their father. It takes a lot for him to respect them. Shiv is building up that respect, slowly, but they’re not even close to their dad’s level. He thought their dad was an asshole, but a brilliant asshole. These guys? They’re fake.

You think Matsson even feels that way about Shiv? I was curious how you viewed their relationship with each other, especially after Shiv all but says she wants to be his CEO. 

	He’s one hundred percent using her. It’s a wedge in between the siblings. He sees an opening. He’s a predator. He sees that he needs to get at least one of them on board. Roman is out, but he smells blood in the water, this friction between the siblings. He smells the opening. He does move fast and break things, but he can read people. He sees that in Shiv, and he goes after that. It’s worked. She’s let him in. Where we’re at now, he’s still feeling the waters and testing her out. Is she also a charlatan? Is she just like her siblings, a little Nepo Baby, or does she have what it takes? That’s what he’s trying to figure out.

	










One of my favorite Matsson moments came last season when he tells Roman about how he loves exploiting weaknesses. Do you think Matsson is aware of some of his own weaknesses, or is that lack of self-awareness a weakness in itself?

	I think you’re right. Sometimes he has a macro perspective. Sometimes, it’s incredibly micro. For example, he’s sending blood bricks to Ebba (Eili Harboe), and there’s something dangerous about that, obviously. If she goes public, it’s really bad for him. But in the moment, he doesn’t think about it, because it’s a really funny thing. He just keeps doing it. It triggers something in him. There are definitely moments where he realizes, “Oh, shit, I’ve definitely stepped in it here. Fuck.” But he’s also an eternal optimist: “Okay, well, we’ll fucking figure it out. I have a big machine of PR people. They’ll handle it.” I think he also really believes in his own charisma and charm, to a ridiculous degree. “Ebba, we’ll figure it out; she has some leverage, but she loves me, this fucking weird, dysfunctional, sadistic relationship that we’re having.” He assumes she’s addicted to it, so it’s safe. But he’s completely unhinged at times, which is obviously quite fun to play.

It really comes across in this episode, where sometimes, Mattson looks like he’s in the exact last place on Earth he wants to be. Then other times, he’s regal. At its worst, it was a compelling night for people-watching.

	Well, it was like throwing a golden hand grenade into a room of grey suits. Hence the golden jacket. It was one of the best sequences to film, for many reasons. One of them was, we were all there. Up until then, there were some actors on the show who I hadn’t worked with, some of them I’d never even met. This was a week of night shoots where we all got to hang out at this crazy penthouse apartment, and I got to interact with characters for the first time, which was so much fun. Then with Matsson, we got to see what’s boring to him? What’s surprising and fun? How does he navigate this room? With Shiv putting him on the little PR tour, how does he navigate that while being himself but also holding back a little bit, to not come across as too eccentric and unhinged? And what happens when he’s been there for too long? What happens when he gets bored? Because his attention span is incredibly short. Matsson doesn’t get bored. When he starts feeling bored, he changes things up. It’s not a breaking point, but when he gets restless, he’ll fucking go crazy and have some fun.

Lang Lang plays ‘Mulan’ song as a magical duet with Nicole Scherzinger at Windsor Castle

        By Sophia Alexandra Hall
    
Star pianist Lang Lang brought a sprinkle of Disney magic to the King’s Coronation Concert at Windsor Castle with his ‘Mulan’ performance.
Superstar Chinese-born pianist Lang Lang appeared at the King’s Coronation Concert alongside singer Nicole Scherzinger to perform a timeless Disney classic.
Set against the fairytale-like backdrop of a real-life castle, the internationally acclaimed pianist appeared on stage on the East Lawn of Windsor Castle in a white suit playing ‘Reflection’ from Mulan on a Steinway & Sons grand piano.
Opening with a solo instrumental interlude utilising the entire range of the piano, he then announced the arrival of his duet partner for the night, Scherzinger.
Played in by a flute solo, Scherzinger was accompanied by a 70-piece orchestra and house band comprising the Massed Bands of the Household Division and the Countess of Wessex’s String Orchestra as she belted the 1996 Disney classic.

Lang Lang is no stranger to the world of Disney, having released his own Disney-inspired album last year.
After he was asked to perform at the coronation, Lang Lang wrote on his social media that is was “an honour” to be performing at the royal event taking place at Windsor Castle the day after King Charles III’s coronation.
Following his performance with Scherzinger, Lucy Illingworth, winner of The Piano (a talent television show hosted by Lang Lang), performed Bach’s Prelude No. 1 in C major on the same stage.

Jeremy Renner posted another social media update on his recovery on Saturday.
The 52-year-old Mayor Of Kingstown actor shared a time-lapse video updating fans on the progress he has made in physical therapy since his near-fatal snowplow accident earlier this year.
The Hawkeye star was seen needing a walker to move around before now being able to walk without any assistance at all.
The Bourne Legacy alum wrote in his Instagram video: 'My PT made this for reference and to remember, you cannot walk unless you take one step at a time! #onefootinfrontoftheother'.
Just months earlier on January 1, Renner survived being crushed by a 14,000 pound snowplow and suffered from major injuries — including more than 30 broken bones.
Keeping fans updated: Jeremy Renner, 52, posted another social media update on his recovery on Saturday
Since then, the Mission Impossible alum has been sharing his daily exercises to his Instagram account and keeping fans updated on his miraculous recovery.
The California native — who made since made his first red carpet since the near-fatal accident at the premiere of his Disney+ series, Rennervations — was seen becoming more confident in his walk over time.
At the beginning of the clip, he was seen practicing steadily with a walker and had to have somebody behind him for additional support.
With dedication and diligence, he advanced to just needing a cane to walk by himself.
Later in the clip compiled by his physical therapist, he was seen not needing any support at all and was walking hands-free. 
By the end of the video, Renner was moving more swiftly and even appeared to have a little bit of pep in his walk. 
On Thursday, he also shared a video of himself pushing himself to continue exercising after a day of physical therapy.
'I've decided to push through the pain of progress (this d*** shattered tibia) and take the new parts for a tiny test drive,' he wrote in the caption.

'The body is miraculous,' he continued. 'Even though I feel like the Tin Man, needing oil for all my new joints (hips, knees, ankles, tibia etc).' 
Renner added: 'Encouraged after this warm up to press on (don’t tell my PT)'. 
In the clip, he stretched and worked out the muscles in his legs with a pulley cable connected to a treadmill.
He practiced mobility in his legs and hips by doing squats as well as various joint exercises.
Earlier in the day, he had also posted a photo of his lower body while performing physical therapy.
With the social media update, he shared that he has been making the 'great progress' in his journey to full recovery and mobility.
In the caption, the California native also wrote that he has been busy 'making recovery and surpassing goals a daily habit'.
The snap shared by Renner did not show his face but instead just the lower half of his body as he exercised on an anti-gravity treadmill.

Renner also shared a photo of himself using a bone growth stimulator and also ending off his busy day with a leg compression machine. 
In April, the Academy Award nominee made an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live to promote his documentary miniseries.
During the interview, he also spoke about how 'lucky' he was to survive the terrifying accident.
He revealed that it was fortunate that the machine missed the critical parts of his anatomy. 
'It just missed every vertebrae, did not hit any organs, membrane did not swell,' he detailed.
'My eye did pop out — that's weird — but I got pretty lucky that none of the organs got messed up,' he added.
The New Year's Day accident left more than 30 of Renner's bones broken.
He was hospitalized in 'critical condition' and underwent multiple surgical procedures.

When Kimmel asked him about the best thing to come out of the incident, Renner joked and responded that it was getting time off for the rest of the year.
'I was making so many plans,' he replied. 'I was going to buy a boat. I was going to live in Mexico ... because my year was pretty jammed up until I got crushed, right?' 
'And then also it was like a New Year's resolution,' he continued. 'I did drop like 20 pounds.'
Renner continued in good humor: 'I quit smoking. It's easy! Easiest way to quit smoking, I'm telling you!'

164,Detroit elementary school temporarily closed as illness sickens 2 dozen - ABC News,https://abcnews.go.com/US/detroit-elementary-school-temporarily-closed-illness-sickens-2/story?id=99102647,"An elementary student died last week after experiencing flu-like symptoms. 
A Detroit school will remain closed until Monday after dozens of students began experiencing flu-like symptoms. Last week, a kindergartner who was sent home with flu-like symptoms later died, the Detroit Public Schools Community District told ABC News.
An elementary student at Marcus Garvey Academy died on April 25, Chrystal Wilson, the assistant superintendent of communications at the Detroit Public Schools Community District, told ABC News. The child who died was 6 years old, according to the Wayne County Medical Examiner's Office.
The following Monday, a number of students at the school began showing flu-like symptoms, including fever and vomiting, and the school advised that those students be sent home.
School and district officials then alerted the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and the Detroit Health Department that students were experiencing symptoms of an illness. Health officials advised that they were unsure what the symptoms could be attributed to, Wilson said.
By Tuesday, there were less than 25 students experiencing symptoms so health officials advised that the school be closed and a deep cleaning be conducted, Wilson said.
While students were advised to visit their physicians for a diagnosis, health officials believe the illnesses may be related to the H flu, or H. influenzae -- a bacteria that can cause a variety of infections in infants and young children, Wilson said.
The infections can be mild, such as ear infections, to serious, like bloodstream infections, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms vary based on the kind of infection but can include fever, chills, vomiting and headaches.
The medical examiner's office has not yet determined the student's cause of death, according to Wilson. The child's cause of death is still pending, the medical examiner's office confirmed to ABC News.
The school has conducted a deep cleaning in classrooms, as recommended by health officials, according to Wilson.
Marcus Garvey Academy will reopen on Monday but students experiencing symptoms are being asked to stay home, Wilson said.

Oops: A massive new study proves the normalization of cannabis use is an ongoing social disaster.
You’ve got to be under the influence — of toxic ideology, if not pot itself — to ignore the evidence.
Researchers analyzing the health data of 6.9 million people have linked weed use to hugely increased mental-illness rates among adolescent males — including as much as a shocking 30% of schizophrenia cases among young men. 
The trend represents not just greater use, but the increasing potency of weed and weed products. 
That will only keep rising as the profit motive and industrialization of production, now that it’s so widely legalized, promote delivery of ever-more concentrated THC (the psychoactive chemical in weed) to users. 
Schizophrenia is one of the most serious, and tragic, psychiatric disorders. 
It can be treated, but patients often go off their meds, become homeless or semi-homeless and terrorize public spaces before harming or killing themselves or others. 
So the sheer size of the study and the magnitude of the effect should make the nearly 70% of Americans who generally back legalization take a hard look in the mirror. 
Including policymakers. 
Here in New York, the rollout of legal weed has been an utter disaster. 
With few legit shops, illegal ones have sprung up everywhere. 
They are targets for crime, with violent robberies at such places up massively this year. 
That’s a far cry from the “equity” paradise left-wingers in Albany promised from legalization. 
And there’s zero way to ensure the shops are following the law on selling only to over-21s.
But the larger problem is the normalization of weed. 
Above all for impressionable teen males, precisely the group most at risk here. 
The numbers prove it. 
Emergency calls related to pot use among 6- to 18-year-olds have jumped 245% since 2000. At one NYC addiction clinic alone, 95% of recent admissions were driven by cannabis. 
Anti-drug laws hold society together. 
Abandoning them doesn’t create equity: It worsens everyone’s quality of life. 
The new study shows it wrecks people’s mental health, too.
So remind us: Exactly what is the justification for continuing on this path?",1
166,From a tongue zapper to breathing classes I tried them all… so what finally stopped me snoring?  | Daily Mail Online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-12060363/From-tongue-zapper-breathing-classes-tried-finally-stopped-snoring.html,"By David Cox

Every night, shortly after my girlfriend and I go to sleep, the peaceful calm of our one-bed flat is disturbed by a cacophony of restless rumblings. At least 15 million men and women in the UK are regular snorers — and, alas, I am one of them.
Men, in particular, are far more likely to be loud sleepers because we have larger upper airways, amplifying any night-time noises.
Alcohol intake and weight gain exacerbate snoring because they make our airways floppier, resulting in the soft tissue vibrations which cause the snoring sound; while a blocked nose can force you to breathe through your mouth, also triggering snores.
In my case, it happens when I roll onto my back during sleep and my jaw retracts, narrowing the airway.
Aside from annoying your partner — according to the Mayo Clinic, women get 13 per cent less sleep a night when their other half is snoring — in some cases, snoring can be a sign of a serious health condition called sleep apnoea, where the airway collapses during sleep, briefly interrupting breathing.
Time for bed: David Cox in search of a cure for his snoring

‘Snoring itself isn’t necessarily a cause for concern,’ says Guy Leschziner, a professor of neurology and sleep medicine at King’s College London.
‘But if it’s disrupting your breathing, it could be sleep apnoea, which is associated with an increased risk of high blood pressure, abnormal heart rhythms, even dementia.’
While sleep apnoea, which is thought to affect up to 10 per cent of middle-aged adults, can be improved through losing weight or wearing a mask through which air is pumped to keep the airways open, there are other ways to combat standard snoring.
And, with an increasing number of products and wellness regimens promising help, I put five to the test. To monitor their effectiveness, I downloaded the SnoreLab app. Designed by sleep science entrepreneur Jules Goldberg after his wife complained about his snoring, it uses sophisticated algorithms to detect, record, and measure how much you snore each night.
I then gave each product a snore score rating based on the app results, my girlfriend’s feedback, cost and ease of use.
Nasal Spray to tighten tissues
Asonor Snoring Nasal Spray, £12.45, amazon.co.uk
Claim: This spray contains ingredients such as polysorbate 80 and glycerol, which the maker says ‘lubricates and softens the mucous membranes in the throat, while also slightly tightening the musculature’. They say it is the vibration of these (dry) mucous membranes which causes snoring — the spray is a ‘clinically proven and medically tested snoring solution’. Used before bed: you spray four times into each nostril.
Expert opinion: Professor Chris Fox, a psychiatrist who runs a national sleep research programme at Exeter University, says: ‘It’s cheap, and it’s using these chemicals to try to moisten things in the throat, which can work, so I think it’s worth a try,’ he says, ‘and it won’t do you any harm’.
However, ‘it claims to be clinically validated but there are no links to the research on the website,’ adds Dr Sophie Bostock, an independent sleep scientist who helped roll out the NHS Sleepio digital sleep improvement program.
My review: This didn’t make a particularly noticeable difference.
SnoreLab app result: 35 minutes of snoring.
My rating: 4/10
Tongue zapper to open airway
Zeus Anti-Snore Device, £150, zeussleep.co.uk
Claim: Targeted at ‘throat snorers’, the maker says this gadget (seen pictured, in writer’s hand) sticks to the skin just below the chin and emits a mild electrical current to stimulate the tongue muscles to contract, opening the airways ‘to aid blissful, uninterrupted sleep’.
Expert opinion: ‘This device works through the skin, transferring electrical signals to the tongue, bringing it forward,’ says Vik Veer, head of the sleep surgery department at the Royal National ENT Hospital in London. ‘This means you don’t end up blocking your breathing at night, and sleep without snoring or sleep apnoea.’
Whether it will work for you or not depends on the root cause of your snoring, he says: this device is aimed at snorers where the tongue flops back during sleep.
‘If you’re lying on your back at night and you have problems with snoring then, rather than when lying on your side, this is more likely to work for you.’
My review: For me, this was the most effective of the interventions I tested. Initially, it feels odd to have a light weight, a bit like a coin, on your throat as you go to sleep — but it is comfortable and after a few nights I forgot that I was wearing it.
The stimulation it applies to your tongue is so mild that I didn’t notice it during sleep and, according to the SnoreLab app, I definitely snored much less.
The only disadvantage with this one is that you have to remember to charge it every couple of days.
SnoreLab app result: No snoring.
My rating: 8/10
Mattress to aid sleep position
Emma Premium Mattress, £413.10, emma-sleep.co.uk
Claim: ‘Studies show sleeping on your side is best for quality breath control and reduction in snoring,’ says Theresa Schnorbach, a sleep scientist at Emma The Sleep Company, adding that this mattress has ‘high-tech springs combined with advanced Halo Memory Foam’ which she suggests will offer good support for side sleeping and will ‘boost sleep quality’.
Expert opinion: According to Professor Leschziner, any mattress or pillow that supports your spine well and helps keep your throat and neck aligned is likely to help curb snoring, as it helps keep your airways open.
‘But some people might find a firmer mattress makes it more uncomfortable to lie in a different position, so it may not always be the solution,’ he says.
My review: Our previous mattress was quite soft, so it took me a month or so to adjust to sleeping comfortably on a much firmer, memory foam one.
But having persevered with it, I now feel that I definitely sleep better.
However, my partner said that it didn’t make much difference to my snoring.
SnoreLab app result: 15 minutes of snoring (following a month of use).
My rating: 6/10
Breathing classes to train muscles
Free on YouTube, or find a local instructor (group classes cost from £11-12 per session)
Claim: A course during which you learn a series of breathing exercises said to train the throat muscles to firm up and encourage nasal breathing during sleep.
‘Breathing techniques are about learning how to breathe using your diaphragm (the dome-shaped muscle below the lungs),’ says Sophie Arkana, a London-based breathwork instructor.
Learning this, she says, helps keep the airways open as you sleep. A 2020 study in the journal Heart & Lung showed a form of breathwork called inspiratory muscle training can help reduce snoring.
Expert opinion: ‘Breathwork can tone muscles in the throat — making them less likely to vibrate — and reduces the risk of mouth-breathing during sleep,’ says Dr Bostock. ‘When you lie on your back and breathe through your mouth, the jaw puts pressure on the soft tissue at the back of the throat, creating a narrowing which can cause snoring.’
Learning to breathe through your nose instead can help stop snoring. ‘While many people breathe through their mouth habitually, nasal breathing allows for more efficient transfer of oxygen, as well as warming, filtering and dehumidifying the air we breathe,’ says Dr Bostock.
My review: I did a week of hour-long breathwork classes on a wellness retreat, which made a surprisingly quick difference — I literally stopped overnight — but free YouTube classes are a cheaper option. The only disadvantage is you need to keep doing the classes, as you can revert to old habits.
SnoreLab app result: No snoring (night after my sessions).
My Rating: 8/10
Air purifier to remove irritants
Philips 3000i Series Air Purifier, £484.99, philips.co.uk
Claim: The company told me: ‘There have been a number of studies done that link snoring to factors such as air pollution and air problems caused by dampness.
‘Philips air purifiers help remove viruses, allergens, aerosols and pollutants in the home, instantly delivering cleaner, healthier air, which can be a real benefit to a healthier and more restful night.’
Expert opinion: ‘We know the presence of dust or even pollen during hay fever season can aggravate and trigger snoring in some people,’ says Professor Fox. ‘This is because they cause nasal congestion, and you’re more likely to snore when you breathe through your mouth during sleep. So an air purifier like this can’t do any harm and it may well reduce the triggers,’ he says.
My review: As a city dweller in a cramped, often untidy, one-bed flat, I was keen to see if improving air quality could help. But while I did sleep better with the purifier running overnight, it only made a slight difference to the snoring. Using an air purifier regularly also hits your electricity bills, so may not be a long-term solution.
SnoreLab app result: 22 minutes of snoring.
My rating: 5/10
Dynamic duos: Nutrients that work best when consumed together
This week: Vitamin B12 and folate
Try: Poached eggs on steamed asparagus or spinach
A deficiency of either vitamin B12 or folate (vitamin B9) can lead to anaemia. ‘Folate needs B12 for its absorption, storage and metabolism, but the two nutrients also act together for cell division and replication,’ explains dietitian Orli Rhodes. ‘They’re vital, too, for a healthy nervous system and for breaking down homocysteine, which can damage blood vessel walls.’ Vitamin B12 is found in animal-derived foods such as eggs, red meat, fish, seafood and poultry; and folate is in plant foods such as avocado, berries and broccoli.
Try: Poached eggs on steamed asparagus or spinach; wholewheat pasta with broccoli and salmon; or steak with a leafy green salad.

167,Brain Surgery Performed on Baby in the Womb for the First Time,https://scitechdaily.com/brain-surgery-performed-on-baby-in-the-womb-for-the-first-time/,"
By American Heart Association
May 8, 2023

In a medical breakthrough, researchers successfully performed the first-ever in-utero surgery to repair a fetus’s life-threatening brain malformation, preventing heart failure and brain injury after birth.
Researchers report on the first-of-its-kind fetal procedure to fix a potentially deadly vascular malformation in the brain, avoiding heart failure and brain injury after birth, published in the journal Stroke.
For the first time, researchers performed a successful in-utero surgery to repair a potentially deadly developmental condition by treating an aggressive vascular malformation, called vein of Galen malformation, in a fetus’s brain before birth, according to new research published on May 4 in Stroke, the peer-reviewed flagship journal of the American Stroke Association, a division of the American Heart Association.
Vein of Galen malformation (VOGM) is a rare prenatal condition in which arteries bringing high-flow, high-pressure blood to the brain from the heart connect directly with one of the main collecting veins deep at the base of the brain, rather than to capillaries that are necessary to slow blood flow and deliver oxygen to surrounding brain tissue. Due to changes in the infant’s vascular physiology during and after the birth process, the high flow in the malformation has an even more serious effect on the heart and brain after birth, putting enormous pressure on the newborn’s heart and lungs. This may lead to pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, or other potentially life-threatening conditions. VOGM is most often first seen on a prenatal ultrasound and is definitively diagnosed by MRI during the late second or third trimester of pregnancy.
The researchers performed the in-utero embolization on a fetus with VOGM at 34 weeks and 2 days gestational age, as the first treated patient in a clinical trial that is underway at Boston Children’s Hospital and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, performed with oversight from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
“In our ongoing clinical trial, we are using ultrasound-guided transuterine embolization to address the vein of Galen malformation before birth, and in our first treated case, we were thrilled to see that the aggressive decline usually seen after birth simply did not appear. We are pleased to report that at six weeks, the infant is progressing remarkably well, on no medications, eating normally, gaining weight and is back home. There are no signs of any negative effects on the brain,” said lead study author Darren B. Orbach, M.D., Ph.D., co-director of the Cerebrovascular Surgery & Interventions Center at Boston Children’s Hospital and an associate professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School.
Due to premature rupture of membranes during the in-utero embolization, the infant was delivered by induction of vaginal birth two days later. Echocardiography after birth showed progressive normalization of cardiac output. In this case, the newborn did not require any cardiovascular support or surgery following the in-utero treatment and was watched in the NICU for several weeks after birth because of prematurity before being sent home. During that time, the newborn had a normal neurological exam and showed no strokes, fluid buildup or hemorrhage on brain MRI.
“While this is only our first treated patient and it is vital that we continue the trial to assess the safety and efficacy in other patients, this approach has the potential to mark a paradigm shift in managing vein of Galen malformation where we repair the malformation prior to birth and head off the heart failure before it occurs, rather than trying to reverse it after birth,” Orbach said. “This may markedly reduce the risk of long-term brain damage, disability or death among these infants.”
It is estimated that VOGM, the most common congenital vascular brain malformation, occurs in as many as one in every 60,000 births. The current standard of care for VOGM is treatment after birth with embolization, a catheter-based procedure to close off the direct artery-to-vein connections in the malformation and block the excess blood flow to the brain and heart. However, embolization itself is high risk and is not always successful at reversing heart failure. Additionally, severe brain damage may have already occurred, which may lead to life-long cognitive disabilities and life-threatening conditions for the infant, or even to death.
“The fetal intervention team at Boston Children’s Hospital and Brigham and Women’s Hospital have successfully devised another in utero procedure that may be very impactful in a specific group of patients diagnosed with vein of Galen malformation,” said Gary M. Satou, M.D., FAHA, the director of pediatric echocardiography at UCLA Mattel Children’s Hospital and co-director of the UCLA Fetal Cardiology Program and who was not involved with the study. Satou, a pediatric cardiologist, is past chair of the American Heart Association’s Congenital Cardiac Defects committee of Young Hearts Council and a clinical professor in the department of pediatrics at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. 
“As always, a number of these fetal cases will need to be performed and followed in order to establish a clear pattern of improvement in both neurologic and cardiovascular outcomes,” Satou said. “Thus, the national clinical trial will be crucial in order to achieve adequate data and, hopefully, successful outcomes.”
The procedure was not without its limitations, noted Colin P. Derdeyn, M.D., a neurointerventional radiologist at University of Iowa Health Care who performs VOGM embolizations on neonates and who was not involved with the study. 
“The key advance here is to intervene before the physiologic events of birth can cause life-threatening heart failure. There are caveats; one successful case is not enough experience for us to conclude that the risks of this procedure are worth the benefits. Safety issues may crop up in future procedures, and this approach through the veins may not be consistently successful in preventing heart failure. The procedure described here is designed to reduce the flow through the malformation and not to cure it,” said Derdeyn, the Krabbenhoft Professor of Radiology and chair and department executive officer of the department of radiology at the University of Iowa Health Care Carver College of Medicine and a past chair of the American Heart Association’s Stroke Council.
 “However, the positive hemodynamic changes that they observed in utero and after birth – reduction in flow, reduction in size of the draining vein, reversal of the abnormal reversed flow in the aorta – are really encouraging. These are some of the most exciting and surprising aspects of this case report,” he said. “This is pioneering work being done in a very careful and responsible way.”

168,"Although this deadly blood disease is still rare in Canada, cases are growing and experts warn it shouldn’t be ignored.",https://ca.style.yahoo.com/babesiosis-explainer-canada-194256991.html,"It has more than 21,000 5-star reviews.
You're probably familiar with Lyme disease, a bacterial infection spread from the bite of an infected deer tick. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), another rare tick-borne illness, babesiosis, is on the rise — with a strong foothold in northeast and midwest United States.
Cases of babesiosis in the U.S. jumped by 25 per cent from 2011 to 2019, causing the CDC to declare the illness an endemic in Vermont, Maine and New Hampshire.
Although this deadly blood disease is still rare in Canada, cases are growing and experts warn it shouldn’t be ignored.
""I expect to see babesiosis continue to spread in Canada,"" Justin Wood, founder of Geneticks, a Canadian-based lab that tests tick-borne disease, tells Yahoo Canada. ""We routinely detect babesia species in tick populations in Canada, and it is likely that babesiosis will continue to spread as the ranges of these ticks and their reservoir species continue to expand.""
""Lyme disease and babesiosis are both severe illnesses which should be taken very seriously,"" Wood says. ""They can both be debilitating to patients, particularly if left untreated.""
Unfortunately, it’s possible to be infected with both tick-carrying pathogens at the same time.
Genetick’s 2022 tick testing data shows that approximately 9 per cent of blacklegged ticks that tested positive for the bacteria that cause Lyme disease also tested positive for babesia. This represented approximately 2 per cent of blacklegged ticks tested across Canada.
In early infection, Wood says that Lyme Disease and babesiosis share a number of symptoms such as lethargy, headaches, body pain and flu-like symptoms. There is also an overlap in symptoms in the later stages of infection which include fever, chills, body aches, loss of appetite, nausea and fatigue.
According to the CDC, babesiosis can be fatal to the elderly and immunocompromised, which is uncommon in cases of Lyme. Severe complications manifest as blood disorders, renal failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
""Some of the main differences to be aware of are that Lyme disease is a bacterial infection, whereas babesiosis is caused by a microorganism called a protozoa,"" Wood explains. ""This means that babesiosis requires a different treatment approach than would generally be used for Lyme disease.""
Because babesiosis infects red blood cells, it’s often considered to be similar to malaria — another protozoan infection that affects red blood cells. Signs of the two blood diseases are so alike that clinical confusion and misdiagnosis of babesiosis as malaria has been reported.
Symptoms unique to babesiosis include air-hunger (a feeling Wood describes as not being able to draw in a complete breath), tinnitus or ringing of the ears and night sweats — which you don’t commonly see with Lyme disease.
According to a recent study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, babesiosis is a fairly new phenomenon in Canada.
The first record of human babesiosis in Canada, caused by babesia duncani, was reported in 2017.
Another study shows that tick-borne diseases (like babesiosis) are on the rise in central Canada and growing swiftly in places like Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.
Wood notes climate change is a significant factor in the rise of babesiosis. Ticks thrive in temperatures of four degrees Celsius and above, with peak blacklegged tick activity usually occurring in the fall. Because temperatures are rising, tick-borne illnesses are increasing throughout Canada.
""Climate change has allowed not only ticks, but the reservoir species that maintain diseases like babesiosis, to expand further and further north into Canada,"" he says. ""As this range expansion progresses, we can expect to see more and more areas in Canada become risk areas for tick-borne diseases like babesiosis.""
Since this blood disease is most commonly spread through the bite of an infected blacklegged tick, ""the best way for people to protect themselves from contracting babesiosis is to prevent tick bites.""
Woods says this can be done by doing regular tick checks, using an insect repellent containing picaridin or Deet, wearing light coloured clothing, and staying to the centre of trails while out hiking.
If you find a tick on your body, remove it carefully with a pair of fine-tipped tweezers as soon as possible and consult your doctor for appropriate next steps. You can also identify ticks using the etick.ca website and submit them to Geneticks for testing.

Scientists have determined that in the last 10 to 20 years of steady global warming, the ocean has played an ""important role"" in the evolution of glaciers, Eric Rignot, professor of system science at the University of California, Irvine, and author of the study, told ABC News.  Melting at the interface between ice sheets and the ocean in the Arctic is much more extensive than previously estimated, according to a study published Monday in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  What is happening at the grounding line -- the junction between a grounded ice sheet and the ocean -- led the researchers to discover much more melting that previously thought at Petermann Glacier in Greenland, according to the paper.

169,Magic Mushrooms Seem to Have A Strange Effect on Color Blindness : ScienceAlert,https://www.sciencealert.com/magic-mushrooms-seem-to-have-a-strange-effect-on-color-blindness,"A new era of clinical research on psilocybin mushrooms (aka 'magic mushrooms') has emboldened some scientists to share their own life-changing experiences with psychedelics.
A recent case study describes a young 35-year-old male researcher in the United States, who claims to distinguish red and green colors better after taking psychedelics.
Following his ingestion of magic mushrooms, which contain the psychoactive substance psilocybin, the subject says his mild color blindness improved over the course of a week according to a common self-administered test.
The case study was written by his colleagues, a team of neurologists and behavioral psychologists, but the data was collected at the initiative of the subject himself.
After self-administering a color blindness test, known as the Ishihara Test, the subject took five grams of dried mushrooms, which is considered a relatively high dose of psilocybin. He then took the Ishihara Test periodically over the next four months.
This test is composed of a series of flashcards that each feature a number made up of green dots, embedded in a background of red dots, or the reverse color arrangement.
Color blindness usually stems from a genetic defect on the X chromosome, and it causes a loss in the eye's pigments that distinguish certain colors.
For someone with red-green color blindness, the opsin pigments are abnormal, which leads red and green to bleed together, obscuring the numbers found in the Ishihara test.
Before taking mushrooms, the subject of the case study scored 14 on the Ishihara test, which indicates mild red-green blindness. Twelve hours after the trip, his score had only improved by one point.
The following day, however, the subject scored 18, which is past the threshold of 'normal color vision'. By day 8, his score had climbed to a peak of 19.
Four months after that initial dose, his score had fallen slightly but was still very much in the range of normal vision. That said, the authors admit, the subject did take other hallucinogens after day 16, which convolutes the results.
The methodology of the case study is hardly very rigorous, but that was not really the point. The subject had noticed in the past that his perceptions of red and green improved for months following the use of psychedelics. And yet since these substances are listed as schedule 1 drugs in the US, clinical research is extremely limited.
The subject simply wanted to know whether he could 'believe' his eyes. So he put them to the test.
In 2020, researchers at the Global Drug Survey announced they had collected 47 reports of color blindness improving following the ingestion of LSD or psilocybin. They suggested more research on the topic, but none came.
The new case study brings attention to the mystery once again.
The findings suggest magic mushrooms just might improve color perception in those who are color blind. What's more, those improvements could last for weeks, if not months after ingesting the drug.
Some reports from the global survey claimed the effect could even last years.
A recent post on Reddit shares a particularly extreme albeit short 'cure' to color blindness. A person who could only see greyish tones following a severe concussion suddenly claimed to see color again after taking mushrooms.
Four days later, another Reddit post announced that the regained color perception had apparently started to fade.
Without scientific testing, it's impossible to say how true these reports really are.
It's fair to be skeptical without more evidence, but what is known is that psilocybin can profoundly alter color perception.
The drug seems to trigger activity in the processing areas of the visual pathway that lie far beyond the eyes. This means that magic mushrooms might trick the mind into seeing colors that the eyes are incapable of sensing themselves.
Understanding more about the drug could help scientists find new ways to improve vision in those with disorders and diseases of the eye.
The study was published in Drug Science, Policy and Law.",1
170,"Return to office could make you fat, alcoholic: study",https://nypost.com/2023/05/08/return-to-office-could-make-you-fat-alcoholic-study/,"
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	
Don’t file this under “perks at work.”
A study shows that going to and from the office can actually be atrocious for your health.
“A lengthy commute to work is associated with being less physically active, being overweight, and having sleep problems,” wrote researchers from Stockholm University.
“And, depending on where your office is located, you may also be more likely to drink in excess.”
It takes a shockingly short travel distance for a person to feel these effects, according to researchers. 
“We found that commutes of more than [about two miles] increased the likelihood of being physically inactive and overweight, and of having poor sleep,” they wrote.
“People who worked more than 40 hours and commuted more than five hours each week were more likely to be physically inactive and experience sleep problems, compared with times when they only commuted one-to-five hours a week.” 
The study looked at the responses of nearly 13,000 Swedes, between the ages of 16 to 64, in four surveys taken in 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2018.
Those whose commutes were within the near two-mile range were observed to be “more physically active.”
“This could be because this distance made it easier to commute by bicycle or foot to work — or because a shorter commute gave participants time before and after work to exercise.”
In regard to drinking habits, an office in “a high socioeconomic status area” made it “more likely” for them to be troublesome.
Participants in the study reported they often felt the need to cut down on their drinking in addition to many who were “drinking first thing in the morning either to steady their nerves or cope with a hangover.”
“We also found that when a person’s workplace was located near a bar, they were more likely to have harmful drinking habits,” the researchers noted.
The team proposed further research and analysis of the strain of commuting, among other connected quality-of-life issues beyond the borders of their Scandinavian nation.
“It will be important to investigate these factors, alongside whether our results are similar for people living in different regions of the world.”",1

Broad-spectrum antibiotics are akin to nuclear bombs, obliterating every prokaryote they meet. They're effective at eliminating pathogens, sure, but they're not so great for maintaining a healthy microbiome. Ideally, we need precision antimicrobials that can target only the harmful bacteria while ignoring the other species we need in our bodies, leaving them to thrive. Enter SNIPR BIOME, a Danish company founded to do just that. Its first drug—SNIPR001—is currently in clinical trials.
The drug is designed for people with cancers involving blood cells. The chemotherapy these patients need can cause immunosuppression along with increased intestinal permeability, so they can't fight off any infections they may get from bacteria that escape from their guts into their bloodstream. The mortality rate from such infections in these patients is around 15–20 percent. Many of the infections are caused by E. coli, and much of this E. coli is already resistant to fluoroquinolones, the antibiotics commonly used to treat these types of infections.
The team at SNIPR BIOME engineers bacteriophages, viruses that target bacteria, to make them hyper-selective. They started by screening 162 phages to find those that would infect a broad range of E. coli strains taken from people with bloodstream or urinary tract infections, as well as from the guts of healthy people. They settled on a set of eight different phages. They then engineered these phages to carry the genes that encode the CRISPR DNA-editing system, along with the RNAs needed to target editing to a number of essential genes in the E. coli genome. This approach has been shown to prevent the evolution of resistance.
After testing the ability of these eight engineered phages to kill the E. coli panel alone and in combination, they decided that a group of four of them was the most effective, naming the mixture SNIPR001. But four engineered phages do not make a drug; the team confirmed that SNIPR001 remains stable for five months in storage and that it does not affect any other gut bacteria.
The researchers showed that SNIPR001 was well-tolerated in Göttingen minipigs—after oral administration, the pigs did not exhibit any clinical, biochemical, hematological, or immunological effects, and no phages were found in their blood, so there was no systemic exposure. In mice, oral administration of SNIPR001 reduced the amount of target E. coli in the feces, and none of the recovered E. coli were resistant to the phage cocktail.
Phage therapy, tempting though it is in theory, has a checkered history at best. But SNIPR BIOME’s goal of using CRISPR to precisely target only harmful bacteria may revitalize this technique, allowing us to continue vanquishing our bacterial foes without promoting drug resistance.

Key Facts: 
Researchers at the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at UCLA and the National Institutes of Health have developed a zebrafish model that provides new insight into how the brain acquires essential omega-3 fatty acids, including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and linolenic acid (ALA).
Their findings, published in Nature Communications, have the potential to improve understanding of lipid transport across the blood-brain barrier and of disruptions in this process that can lead to birth defects or neurological conditions.
The model may also enable researchers to design drug molecules that are capable of directly reaching the brain.
Omega-3 fatty acids are considered essential because the body cannot make them and must obtain them through foods, such as fish, nuts and seeds. DHA levels are especially high in the brain and important for a healthy nervous system.
 Infants obtain DHA from breastmilk or formula, and deficiencies of this fatty acid have been linked to problems with learning and memory.
To get to the brain, omega-3 fatty acids must pass through the blood-brain barrier via the lipid transporter Mfsd2a, which is essential for normal brain development. Despite its importance, scientists did not know precisely how Mfsd2a transports DHA and other omega-3 fatty acids.
In the study, the research team provides images of the structure of zebrafish Mfsd2a, which is similar to its human counterpart. The snapshots are the first to detail precisely how fatty acids move across the cell membrane.
The study team also identified three compartments in Mfsd2a that suggest distinct steps required to move and flip fatty acids through the transporter, as opposed to movement through a linear tunnel or along the surface of the protein complex.
The findings provide key information on how Mfsd2a transports omega-3 fatty acids into the brain and may enable researchers to optimize drug delivery via this route.
The study also provides foundational knowledge on how other members of this transporter family, called the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), regulate important cellular functions.
The study was led by Tamir Gonen, Ph.D., of UCLA and Doreen Matthies, Ph.D., of NIH’s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). Additional funding for the study was provided by NIH’s National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.

Abstract
Lipid flipping in the omega-3 fatty-acid transporter
Mfsd2a is the transporter for docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 fatty acid, across the blood brain barrier (BBB). Defects in Mfsd2a are linked to ailments from behavioral and motor dysfunctions to microcephaly.
Mfsd2a transports long-chain unsaturated fatty-acids, including DHA and α-linolenic acid (ALA), that are attached to the zwitterionic lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) headgroup.
Even with the recently determined structures of Mfsd2a, the molecular details of how this transporter performs the energetically unfavorable task of translocating and flipping lysolipids across the lipid bilayer remains unclear.
Here, we report five single-particle cryo-EM structures of Danio rerio Mfsd2a (drMfsd2a): in the inward-open conformation in the ligand-free state and displaying lipid-like densities modeled as ALA-LPC at four distinct positions.
These Mfsd2a snapshots detail the flipping mechanism for lipid-LPC from outer to inner membrane leaflet and release for membrane integration on the cytoplasmic side.
These results also map Mfsd2a mutants that disrupt lipid-LPC transport and are associated with disease.

173,When Nutrition Timing Actually Matters,https://lifehacker.com/when-nutrition-timing-actually-matters-1850410324,"When you’re working out and aiming for a particular goal,  it’s smart to pull the big levers first. Getting enough food, enough sleep, and enough training time will have the biggest impact on your results. But once you’ve got the basics down, it’s time to learn how to properly time your nutrition throughout the day. 
As a refresher, one of the most important things in nutrition is eating the right amount of food, which we usually measure in terms of calories. Eat less than you burn to lose weight, more than you burn to gain weight (useful if you are trying to gain muscle), or if you don’t want to do either, simply hold your calories at whatever level keeps your weight stable. If changing your body size isn’t a priority, you don’t need to track this exactly; just make sure you’re not accidentally undereating when you don’t mean to.
Next up is protein. If you’re gaining muscle, it’s an important building block. If you’re losing weight, eating protein (and strength training!) helps your body to retain as much muscle as possible so that most of the weight lost is fat. And if you’re doing any amount of strength training or endurance training (like running), protein helps you to maintain the muscle that helps you do all of that. 
Once you’re consistently getting enough calories and protein, you have a lot more leeway to adjust your diet to your liking. We should all get some amount of fat—0.5 grams per pound of bodyweight or more. And carbs may not be essential for life (as low-carb dieters like to point out) but people who eat a lot of carbs have a much better time in the gym than those who don’t. Carbs provide energy for activity, and they prevent your body from turning to muscle tissue for extra energy. 
Finally, the rest of the nutrient content of your food matters, too. Fiber is important. Vitamins are important. Fruits and vegetables should be a big part of everyone’s diet. These things support health even if they aren’t the macros you might be tracking. 
I mention all this because what you eat is more important than when you eat it. If you aren’t getting enough protein or enough vegetables, fixing that situation is more important than getting everything timed properly. But if you’ve got the basics down, let’s talk timing.
When we’re resting, our body fat provides most of the fuel our body needs. The body is constantly using fat for energy, which is why “fat burning” workouts or supplements are just silly. Fat is like a bank account: the amount is determined by how the deposits balance out the withdrawals, not by looking at withdrawals alone.
When we exercise, it’s hard for the slow and steady pace of our fat burning to keep up with what we’re asking our body to do. If we have carbs available, in the form of blood sugar or muscle glycogen, we use those as a source of fuel. If we don’t have enough carbs available, we can feel tired or sluggish. We might still be able to get the workout done, but workouts will often feel better if we’ve managed to get some carbs before or even during the workout.
So if you’re feeling sluggish during your workouts, consider having some carbs beforehand. Also consider this timing if your workouts start out well but you get unusually fatigued by the end, or if you’re in the habit of training before breakfast and want to test out whether nutrition timing could give you an extra boost you didn’t even know you were missing. 
“Carbs” refers to anything with sugar, or anything that breaks down quickly into sugar, which mainly means starches. If you can eat a meal shortly before your workout, try classics like:
Proteins and fats can slow down digestion, so you don’t want too much of them in a meal you have right before your workout. That’s why you’d want to go with the lower fat dairy options, or keep the peanut butter on your toast to a thin layer. But if you’re eating breakfast a few hours before your workout, feel free to go for the slower digesting versions with full-fat dairy, or even throw some protein powder into your smoothie.
When workouts go longer than an hour or so, you may need more than just a pre-workout snack. This is why marathon runners will suck down packets of gel while they run, and why powerlifters pass around bags of candy between sets. 
If you’re having carbs during a workout, you’ll want something that digests quickly. This means you want something that is more or less pure sugar. Yes, you should arguably avoid sugar in general in a healthy diet, but in the middle of a workout sugar serves a very specific purpose. It becomes available to your body very quickly, the better to fuel you in the moment. If you’re in the middle of an endurance event, like a long run or bike ride, you may want to consume 30 to 60 grams of carbs per hour. Examples would be:
Many of us don’t work out long enough or hard enough to have to worry about this. But if you’re training for a marathon or a half and you find yourself dragging toward the end of your long runs, or if your lifting sessions can extend well past an hour and you find yourself resting longer and longer between sets toward the end, try a gel or a snack mid-workout and see if you feel a difference.
Let’s take another look at muscle glycogen, one of those carb sources we use during exercise. After a workout, glycogen will be depleted. Over the course of the next 24 hours or so, we’ll eat carbs as part of our meals, and those glycogen stores will get filled back up. 
Eating a diet high in carbs helps to fill those glycogen stores throughout the day and keep them full. (You may not get as much replenishment if you follow a low-carb diet like keto.) If you finish a workout and aren’t likely to have another workout until tomorrow or the day after, you don’t really need to worry about this; just eat normally. 
But if you do two hard workouts a day, or if you just did a workout in the evening but you also want to be at your best for a run the next morning, you may want to replenish your glycogen more quickly. After a hard workout, your muscles are ready to store carbs as glycogen if they can get them, so consider a high-carb meal after your workout.
The most important factor in eating protein is the amount, as we discussed above. To meet the recommended daily allowance (the bare minimum that everybody should get, athlete or not) you want 0.36 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight. That would be 54 grams for a 150-pound person. 
But if you’re trying to build muscle, or if you’re trying to maintain muscle as you train for an endurance sport or as you  lose weight, you want more—anywhere between 0.63 to 0.82 grams per pound of bodyweight depending on how intense your needs are. That would be 95 to 123 grams for that same 150-pound person. Going over that amount is usually okay for your health (talk to your doctor if you have kidney issues) but not necessary.
So what about timing? Well, it turns out that your body makes the best use of protein if you can get it in multiple doses throughout the day. There’s a myth that your body can only use a small amount of protein in one sitting, leading some people to believe that the extra protein is “wasted.” That’s not exactly true, but you probably will give your body stronger signals to build muscle if you can spread your protein out over four or five meals rather than eating low-protein foods all day and then having a giant steak for dinner. 
A good way to follow this rule of thumb is to track your total protein, and to make sure you have several times during the day that you’re eating at least 20 grams of protein or more. That could be breakfast, lunch, a protein bar as a snack, dinner, and then a simple shake with protein powder in the evening. 
We’ve talked about quick-digesting carbs (sugar, plain starches), but the flip side is that other nutrients digest more slowly. You don’t want that when you’re in the middle of a workout, but it can be useful at other times. 
For example, oatmeal tends to make you feel full longer than something like white bread because it’s got a lot of soluble fiber. Proteins make you feel full because your stomach holds onto protein-containing foods longer than other foods. (The stomach is just one of many parts of your digestive system, but it’s the one where proteins take some time to be broken down before being sent to the next stage.) Fats tend to also make people feel full, although this can vary from person to person. 
So if you’re eating a breakfast before a long morning of work and you know it will be a while before you get to lunch, oats (fiber) with almond butter (fat) and a side of scrambled egg whites (protein) will keep you full a lot longer than some toast with jam. Save the toast for later, when you want to have a pre-workout snack. ",1
175,Scientists linked to Wuhan lab back in business as US renews grant for natural origins research,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/covid-origins-wuhan-coronavirus-scientists-virus/,"
			‘We have a lot of human serum samples in the freezers around Southeast Asia and they will provide clues,’ says EcoHealth
		
The US government has resumed its funding of EcoHealth Alliance, the pioneering but controversial research organisation whose ties with the Wuhan Institute of Virology were called into question following the outbreak of Covid-19.
EcoHealth, run by the British-born zoologist Peter Daszak, confirmed on Monday that a grant from the prestigious National Institutes of Health (NIH) will be restarted, following its “termination” shortly after the pandemic broke out in 2020 amid a political firestorm.
Under the terms of the grant, EcoHealth will receive $568,370 (£451,581) for each of the next four years to continue its work on “bat-origin coronaviruses”. It has committed, however, not to subcontract work to China, collect new virus samples from the wild or engage in any recombination or so-called “gain of function” research.
The decision to renew the grant is expected to spark heated debate in the US Congress and beyond. It will cause an “absolute s**t storm”, said one academic who asked not to be named.
Dr Daszak said the resumption of NIH funding would enable EcoHealth Alliance to analyse hundreds of animal and human genetic sequences collected ahead of the pandemic which had been archived and were now held in cold storage.. 
“We're very pleased that finally, after three and a half years, we've been able to get back to work on this critical issue,” he said. “Core to understanding why Covid emerged is why these coronaviruses seem to be able to emerge into people in this region.”
According to the grant award, the main thrust of the research is to “understand what factors allow bat-origin coronaviruses, including close relatives to Sars, to jump into humans” by studying their evolutionary diversity, patterns of spillover and genetic diversity. 
The work “will produce reagents and genetic sequences that can be used to test vaccines and therapeutics to fight future pandemics, and hotspot maps that can be used to target surveillance and control measures”, it says. 
Dr Daszak said the work was unlikely to show how the pandemic started, although stored human blood human samples held by EcoHealth may provide “clues”.
“We are not going to do any recombinant virus work. We're not going to subcontract to Wuhan or any other organisation in China but we are going to use the results from our previous work that no one's had access to,” he said.
He added: “Some of the human samples might give us clues about Covid origins. We do have a lot of human serum samples in the freezers around Southeast Asia, and it may be that some of those show high levels of spillover of SARS-like coronaviruses. But the primary goal is to understand why coronaviruses [present] a high risk of spillover, not to hunt down the origin of Covid.”
Ecohealth was first funded by the NIA in 2014 and produced ground breaking research in its first five years. The group was the first to identify bats as the wildlife reservoir of SARS-CoV and repeatedly warned ahead of the pandemic that a spillover to humans was probable.
Its grant was renewed for a further five years in 2019 only to be stopped a year later amid fierce anti-China rhetoric from the Trump administration in the early days of the pandemic. The termination came just a week after President Donald Trump, when asked about the project at a press conference, said: ""We will end that grant very quickly.""
A review of the grant published last year by the US Office of the Inspector General found infringements in the administration of the contract but concluded its early termination had been “improper”. Supporters included more than 80 former Nobel Laureates who signed a letter to the NIH calling for the funding to be resumed.
“We believe that this action sets a dangerous precedent by interfering in the conduct of science,” they wrote. “Now is precisely the time when we need to support this kind of research if we aim to control the pandemic and prevent subsequent ones.”
Nobel Laureate Sir Richard Roberts, who organised the letter, welcomed news of the new NIH funding and blamed political pressure and weak leadership for it being stopped in the first place.
“Unfortunately, NIH is subjected to political pressure from time to time, but mainly when they have a weak Director, who is afraid to stand up to the politicians,” he told The Telegraph.
“If Francis Collins [then NIH Director] had any balls he would have resigned before allowing the EcoHealth Alliance grant to be cut.”
Sir Richard added: “EcoHealth Alliance has been a very important component of our surveillance of bat viruses … Their programs are an important part of the world’s scientific efforts to identify potential pathogens and whenever possible to nip them in the bud.”
The resumption of the grant comes at an exciting time for research into the origins of SARS-CoV-2, with several important papers having been published in recent months.
Genomic data recently released by a team led by Dr George Gao, the former head of China’s Centers for Disease Control, showed DNA from suspect wildlife, including raccoon dogs, was mixed with Covid-positive samples collected in the Huanan wet market shortly after it was closed in January 2020. The data are not a smoking gun but show animals capable of catching and spreading SARS-Cov-2 were in the market – something the Chinese authorities had originally denied.
A second important study published in March showed that people living in remote parts of southeast asia are picking up a range of respiratory viruses carried by bats and pangolins through work in remote areas including logging, hunting, mining and farming. Of 693 people screened by a team in Myanmar between July 2017 and February 2020, 12.1 per cent had antibodies to such viruses in their blood.
“Antibodies against RaTG13 were the most identified antibodies among all sarbecovirus exposures identified in this study”, said the authors. “RaTG13 is the closest known relative to SARS-CoV-2.”
Last week a third study which looked at 112 bats, collected from Hainan Province, China, discovered a distant relative of SARS-CoV-2 in the wild with a number of near identical structures including a furin cleavage site - something that some had contended could only be engineered in a lab.
“This study deepens our understanding of the diversity of coronaviruses and provides clues about the natural origin of the furin cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2,” said the authors.
The process whereby novel pathogens are picked up by humans from wildlife in remote parts of southeast asia had previously been predicted by models published by EcoHealth. It estimates coronaviruses carried by bats infect around 66,000 people in the region every year. 
Most infections die out naturally either because the virus has not evolved to spread efficiently or because the community is too remote. However, the possibility of a wider outbreak is always a danger with logging, fur farms, wet markets and other, as yet unknown, factors increasing the risk.
Dr Stuart Neil, professor of virology at King's College London, welcomed news of the new funding, saying more research was needed if we are to prevent future outbreaks.
“It's happened twice in 20 years. There's no reason why it won't happen again,” he said. “Understanding where these viruses are, the hosts they’re in and how they are interacting with the environment in such a way they come into contact with us is incredibly important.”

America's biggest fruitphobe states have been revealed in a DailyMail.com interactive map.
Based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data, the map shows how nearly half of adults in eight states do not consume a single piece of fruit per day.
The states are concentrated in the South, which has traditionally scored poorly for fast food consumption, obesity and other diet metrics.
Overall, across the country, three in five Americans consume more than one piece of fruit a day. The CDC says every adult should consume 1.5 to two cups of fruits and two to three cups of vegetables per day to get enough nutrients and avoid any deficiencies, or five a day.
The data was pulled from the 2021 CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, which surveyed 440,000 Americans across the US.
For the survey, participants were asked: 'Now think about the foods you are or drank during the past month, that is, the past 30 days, including meals and snacks.
'Not including juices, how often did you eat fruit?'
Source: CDC
Data shows the proportion of people eating less than one fruit per day. 
For vegetables, they were asked: 'How often did you eat a green leafy or lettuce salad, with or without other vegetables?'
Oklahoma had the highest proportion of people who didn't eat at least one piece of fruit per day at 48.7 percent of respondents.
Rounding out the top five were Louisiana (48.6 percent), followed by Mississippi (46.8 percent), Tennessee (46.1), and West Virginia (46).
These states were also among the most impoverished in the nation, all in the top ten for those with the highest poverty rates according to the 2020 US census.
Low-income families are more likely to purchase ultra-processed foods and less likely to buy fruits and vegetables than those from wealthier households.
This is linked to ultra-processed foods being cheaper, as well as convenience and processed foods being more palatable because they contain more fats and sugars, according to a 2018 study from Johns Hopkins University.
In Oklahoma, about one in six individuals are food insecure — unable to access sufficient food to meet their needs — according to the Oklahoma Policy Institute.
One in four employees in the state also earns less than the national poverty level — below $13,590 per year for individuals.
The above graph shows fruits consumed in the US per capita. It reveals a gradual downturn in the proportion consumed that is processed, while the amount that is consumed fresh is ticking upwards

Source: CDC.
Data shows the proportion of people eating less than one vegetable per day. 
The situation is no better in Louisiana, where nearly a fifth of children live in a house that is food insecure, data from 2019 to 2021 collected by the Annie E. Casey Foundation shows.
Some 19 percent of households in the state also live below the national poverty line, while the proportion in deep poverty — earning less than half the $27,750 needed for a family of four — was 8.7 percent.
In terms of vegetable consumption, Louisiana had the most people eating too few vegetables, with 25.6 percent having less than one a day.
It was followed by Texas (24.1 percent), Nevada (24), Mississippi (23.2) and Iowa (23).
The lack of consumption of sufficient fruits and vegetables is putting people in these states at higher risk of obesity because they are eating more processed foods.
Of the top ten states for the most people avoiding fruits, seven of them — Oklahoma, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, West Virginia, Arkansas and Kentucky — were also in the top ten obesity rates in the US.
Oklahoma also had the highest death rate from heart disease in the US — at 264.2 fatalities per 100,000 people — while Louisiana — at 235.5 per 100,000 — has the fourth highest.
Health officials say it is essential to get the 'full rainbow' of fruit and vegetables every day to ensure consumption of the full range of nutrients their body needs.
Previous research has shown how adequate consumption is linked to a lower risk for heart disease, diabetes, some cancers and obesity.

The method dramatically improves the performance of advanced protein-misfolding detection methods. The technique could lead to earlier treatment and mitigation of various diseases that affect humans and animals.
Key Facts: 
Source: University of Minnesota
University of Minnesota Twin Cities researchers have developed a groundbreaking new diagnostic technique that will allow for faster and more accurate detection of neurodegenerative diseases. 
The method will likely open a door for earlier treatment and mitigation of various diseases that affect humans, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, and similar diseases that affect animals, such as chronic wasting disease (CWD).
Their new study is published in Nano Letters, a premier journal in the field of nanotechnology published by the American Chemical Society.
“This paper mainly focuses on chronic wasting disease in deer, but ultimately our goal is to expand the technology for a broad spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s being the two main targets,” said Sang-Hyun Oh, senior co-author of the paper and a Distinguished McKnight University Professor in the University of Minnesota Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.
“Our vision is to develop ultra-sensitive, powerful diagnostic techniques for a variety of neurodegenerative diseases so that we can detect biomarkers early on, perhaps allowing more time for the deployment of therapeutic agents that can slow down the disease progression. We want to help improve the lives of millions of people affected by neurodegenerative diseases.”
Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, mad cow disease, and CWD (widely found in deer) share a common feature—the buildup of misfolded proteins in the central nervous system. Detecting these misfolded proteins is crucial for understanding and diagnosing these devastating disorders.
However, existing diagnostic methods, like enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunohistochemistry, can be expensive, time-consuming, and limiting in terms of antibody specificity.
The University of Minnesota researchers’ method, dubbed Nano-QuIC (Nanoparticle-enhanced Quaking-Induced Conversion), significantly improves the performance of advanced protein-misfolding detection methods, such as the NIH Rocky Mountain Laboratories’ Real-Time Quaking-Induced Conversion (RT-QuIC) assay.
The RT-QuIC method involves shaking a mixture of normal proteins with a small amount of misfolded protein, triggering a chain reaction that causes the proteins to multiply and allowing for the detection of these irregular proteins.
Using tissue samples from deer, the University of Minnesota team demonstrated that adding 50-nanometer silica nanoparticles to RT-QuIC experiments dramatically reduces detection times from about 14 hours to only four hours and increases the sensitivity by a factor of 10.
A typical 14-hour detection cycle means that a lab technician can run only one test per normal working day. However, with a detection time of less than four hours, researchers can now run three or even four tests per day.
Having a quicker and highly accurate detection method is particularly important for understanding and controlling transmission of CWD, a disease that is spreading in deer across North America, Scandinavia, and South Korea.
The researchers believe that Nano-QuIC could eventually prove useful for detecting protein-misfolding diseases in humans, specifically Parkinson’s, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, Alzheimer’s, and ALS.
“Testing for these neurodegenerative diseases in both animals and humans has been a major challenge to our society,” said Peter Larsen, senior co-author of the paper and an assistant professor in the University of Minnesota Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences.
“What we’re seeing now is this really exciting time when new, next generation diagnostic tests are emerging for these diseases. The impact that our research has is that it’s greatly improving upon those next generation tests, it’s making them more sensitive, and it’s making them more accessible.”
The research was funded by the Minnesota Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund as recommended by the Legislative-Citizen Commission on Minnesota Resources (LCCMR); the Minnesota Agricultural Experiment Station Rapid Agricultural Response Fund; and the Minnesota Agricultural, Research, Education, Extension and Technology Transfer (AGREETT) program.
“Minnesotans value science and support basic and applied research. As legislators, we have invested Environmental Trust Fund dollars to provide solutions for complex problems like chronic wasting disease,” said Representative Rick Hansen, chair of the Minnesota House Environment and Natural Resources Committee and co-chair of the LCCMR.
“I am proud of the work of the LCCMR and the legislature in supporting this research and will continue to advocate for funding to research and prevent future problems affecting our wildlife and ourselves.”
Larsen and Oh lead the University’s Minnesota Center for Prion Research and Outreach (MNPRO) molecular diagnostic research and development team, which leverages this government funding to conduct research on protein misfolding diseases that greatly impact the state of Minnesota.

Abstract
Nanoparticle-Enhanced RT-QuIC (Nano-QuIC) Diagnostic Assay for Misfolded Proteins
Misfolded proteins associated with various neurodegenerative diseases often accumulate in tissues or circulate in biological fluids years before the clinical onset, thus representing ideal diagnostic targets.
Real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC), a protein-based seeded-amplification assay, holds great potential for early disease detection, yet challenges remain for routine diagnostic application.
Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD), associated with misfolded prion proteins of cervids, serves as an ideal model for evaluating new RT-QuIC methodologies. In this study, we investigate the previously untested hypothesis that incorporating nanoparticles into RT-QuIC assays can enhance their speed and sensitivity when applied to biological samples.
We show that adding 50 nm silica nanoparticles to RT-QuIC experiments (termed Nano-QuIC) for CWD diagnostics greatly improves the performance by reducing detection times 2.5-fold and increasing sensitivity 10-fold by overcoming the effect of inhibitors in complex tissue samples.
Crucially, no false positives were observed with these 50 nm silica nanoparticles, demonstrating the enhanced reliability and potential for diagnostic application of Nano-QuIC in detecting misfolded proteins.

When it comes to your child's eating habits, there is a science to ensuring they do not become fussy eaters.
Some children are susceptible to sensory properties of food, such as odor and texture, which could be off-putting and send them on a path to food refusal.
UK parenting expert and child nutritionist Charlotte Stirling-Reed told DailyMail.com that the best way to avoid picky eating is 'Veg-Led Weaning', the idea of incrementally building up children's tolerance for bitter veggies as they move to solid foods.
Babies are born with a love for sweetness but lack a taste for savory and bitter foods.
Some children are susceptible to sensory properties of food, such as odor and texture, which could be off-putting and send them on a path to food refusal
'It is about starting the weaning journey with a variety of veggies to help your baby taste a variety of very new flavors,' said Stirling-Reed.
'Once you have offered some single tastes of veggies,  it is about broadening out and gently and gradually offering more variety, including some proteins, fruits and carbohydrates, while still providing plenty of veggies too.' 
The American Academy of Pediatrics says children around six months can start changing from purees to solid foods.
However, foods that are only blended, mashed or soft-cooked are recommended. And this includes cereals.
When a child is seven or eight months old, they can eat various foods from different food groups.
'Introducing solid foods is such an exciting time, but for many, it can also be a time of confusion and anxiety…which is exactly why I do the work that I do to try and offer families confidence when it comes to feeding their babies those very first foods,' Stirling-Reed, who is a Sunday Times best-selling author of 'How to Wean your baby' and 'How to Feed Your Toddler, said.
'There is a new concept in weaning that I like to refer to as Veg Led Weaning. It's about starting your baby's weaning journey with veggies.
'Vegetables are a great idea to offer a safe, cheap and convenient first food for baby which are easy to prepare and help to provide your baby more taste explorations.'
Vegetables are also packed with complex carbs, fiber, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants essential to your baby's development.
Stirling-Reed explained that parents should focus on balanced meals when their baby reaches 10 months.
She suggested offering a carbohydrate, protein, vegetable or fruit and some type of dairy as one meal.
'You may need to adapt the meals for younger babies and toddlers, but you can still offer them balanced family options,' said Stirling-Reed.
Parenting expert and child nutritionist Charlotte Stirling-Reed told DailyMail.com that the best way to avoid picky eating is 'Veg Led Weaning.' She recommends the Tripp Trapp high chair so your baby feels like they are eating with the family
For example, spaghetti Bolognese includes beef (or lentils), tomatoes, pasta and often a little cheese. Curry usually includes rice, vegetables and chicken (or chickpeas), but you might need to mash, chop or cook food a little more for younger babies and toddlers.'

Not only does holding your little one close keep them warm, but it curbs crying, regulates breathing and heart rate, helps with weight gain and improves growth. 
However, she is not blind to the fact that food refusal is still on the table.
'This is really common and most families go through periods of food refusal. However, they have weaned their child. That’s OK,' said Stirling-Reed.
'Remember that children’s appetites are naturally up and down, so some days they eat more and others much less.'
She provides ways to cope with food refusal, such as accepting their appetite cure.
If your child does not want to eat a particular dish, accept it and do not push them. 
Research has shown that force-fed children usually have lower weights and increased picky eating.
Another way to navigate refusal is to eat with your child. 
'I am a big fan of trying to bring them into your family mealtimes and offer them similar foods and meals (albeit perhaps slightly adapted for baby) to what you’re eating as a family,' said Stirling-Reed.
'This is why I love the Stokke Tripp Trapp as it allows that to happen and helps babies get familiar with the style of eating for your family. 
'This means that as they get older and into toddlerhood, they are more likely to accept your family meals and family cooking if they have been offered it and are familiar with it from a young age.'
She also encourages parents not to bring attention to their child's picky eating because that usually prolongs the behavior.

181,"After 31 Years, I Read My Mother’s Suicide Note For The First Time. 5 Words Changed Everything. | HuffPost HuffPost Personal",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mother-suicide-note-31-years-later_n_6455e900e4b0452cee9db20a,"Guest Writer
I read my mother’s suicide note for the first time at 36 years old while making chocolate chip protein pancakes for my daughter.
It was difficult to read — literally. It had been written on a hotel notepad 31 years ago and photographed as evidence after it was found. The photos sat in a filing cabinet until the case was closed, when the note was converted to microfiche. But I recently submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to the police department for my mother’s death investigation case file. Then, the note was printed on white copy paper and handed over to me.
At the kitchen counter, I turned to flip the pancakes and then flip through the file, reading about the housekeeper who found my mother’s body, the interviews that police conducted with my family, the medical examiner’s report. My daughter played with Lego bricks at the kitchen table. I had planned to wait until she went to school to read the report, but the compulsion to learn about my mother’s death after all those years proved an overwhelming draw.
My mother died when I was 5 years old and my sister 2. I was told at the time that my mother had a “brain disease.” I suppose that was the way a professional had advised my dad to explain mental illness to a child as young as I was. I remember being in kindergarten with the school social worker and drawing a pink, blobby brain shape with a graphite gray spot on it.
My dad was not, is not, shy about his love for my mother. Every anniversary, he writes a column — poems, song lyrics, words — about how much he misses her and how proud of us she would be. When I was younger, these columns were published in the local newspaper. In recent years, they have transformed into moving Facebook posts with pictures of the grandchildren she will never get to meet.
As children, my dad took us to the cemetery often to “visit” my mom. My sister and I took turns choosing the flowers that we put in the upturned urn on her headstone and snuggling with a small, tan teddy bear he told us had belonged to her. My mother’s side of the closet stayed full of her clothes for decades, and mementos of her still remain in my dad’s home. We talked about the loss, but we never really talked about the woman, her life and her death beyond the superficial.
At some point in my childhood, I must have worked up the nerve to ask more questions about her, although I do not remember a specific conversation. That is when I learned that my mother had taken her own life at a hotel near our home. No additional details were forthcoming, and perhaps that is why, over the decades in between, I never asked any more questions. What more did I need to know, and what good would it do? 
As a young child, I was often angry that I didn’t have my mother as a “room mom” or to celebrate Mother’s Day with. I was resentful when teachers assumed that it was a mother who packed my lunches and signed my permission slips. But as I grew, I got good grades and received scholarships to college, and I met and married an incredible partner. It did not seem to matter that I did not have a mother — until I became one myself.
My daughter was born healthy, beautiful and colicky. She cried nearly constantly for the better part of six months. Nothing I did seemed to help — breastfeeding, baby-wearing, multiple trips to the pediatrician. I spent the days and nights listening to her incessant, incriminating howls. The cries accumulated in my psyche as evidence that I didn’t deserve to be a mother, that I would never be good enough. I began to have fleeting thoughts of leaving like my mother had. I also wished she was there to help and reassure me.
I survived those early months, when I wasn’t fantasizing about starting a new life, by writing to my daughter. I wrote messages of love in the covers of books I ordered for each holiday and piled in her room. I wrote cards and letters, crying onto them while she cried in the background. I wrote over and over again to my daughter about how special she was, the joy she brought to our family, my hopes and dreams for her future.
I sealed the notes to my daughter in envelopes and stacked them into a pink safe I ordered for this purpose. If it turned out that I couldn’t stay, at least my daughter would have tangible evidence that her mother loved her.
Eventually, the crying subsided — and along with it, my thoughts of departure. 
As my daughter has grown, I have been awed by her empathy, compassion and creativity while simultaneously feeling unworthy of the privilege of being her mother. I have tried to fix this through frenzy; I enrolled her in private school, fed her fruits and vegetables, minimized screen time. We moved to a bigger house, bought her a scooter with light-up wheels, adopted a guinea pig. Checking all of the boxes kept the feelings of inadequacy at bay for a while. 
Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit, and we went through the same shock and upheaval as many families across the world. For my daughter, the stresses were perhaps compounded by my working as a nurse in the emergency department and my husband in law enforcement. Again, nothing I did or tried could fix how she felt.
Out of desperation, I resumed writing. I signed up for a writing workshop and penned a 78,717-word novel about a woman with a dead mother trying to parent her daughter through hard times. After months of revising the draft, trying to write the happy ending that I wanted for my characters — and for me and my daughter — I gave up. There were too many holes in the story, and the biggest was the protagonist’s relationship with her dead mother, i.e., my relationship with mine. I finally confronted the fact that to write the ending, I needed to look back to my beginnings, to my relationship with my mother. Perhaps there would be wisdom in unraveling our history.
I began my journey by obtaining my mother’s death investigation file and court records. In hindsight, it seems revealing that I would rather look through a police file than have an honest conversation with my family about who my mother was. 
When I finally read my mother’s suicide note for the first time, five words jumped out at me.
“I was a horrible mother.”
I surprised myself by feeling not shocked or sad, but relieved by her words. “I am a horrible mother” had been the refrain in my mind for my daughter’s entire 9 years of life. Thirty-one years after my mother’s death, here was physical evidence of the thread that connected us across the decades.
It wasn’t until months later that I noticed additional text at the bottom, nearly impossible to make out. I had to reference the typed rendering in the police report. It was transcribed as my initials, then my sister’s, and then “I love you and I did the best things for you.” 
Her last words were to tell us that she loved us and was trying to do right by us. I find this somewhat comforting. But having now known my daughter twice as long as my mother knew me, those words on that scrap of paper, and the intention, don’t make up for my loss.
Although my heart hurts for my mother and how sick she must have been, her actions sent out shock waves of trauma with intergenerational consequences. Their impact on me may be part of the reason that my daughter feels the hurts of the world so deeply.
But the moral of my mother’s story seems to be simple: My presence means more than perfection to my child. I hope that the more I am brave enough to ask the hard questions, and to speak and write honestly, the more my daughter and I can undo the “horrible mother” legacy, break the cycle and create a better future.

182,'mRNA vaccine may cause heart inflammation',https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/1068303-mrna-vaccine-may-cause-heart-inflammation,"A recent study has revealed that COVID mRNA vaccines that trigger overactive immune responses may be the cause of rare heart inflammation among young men, NBC News reported.
The study which was published in Science Immunology was conducted on 23 patients from the ages of 12 to 21. The patients had developed myocarditis as they received the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine.
The blood sample analysis from the nine patients who received Pfizer jabs reported higher cytokine levels.
Myocarditis or pericarditis are the two types of heart inflammation conditions that young men develop.
Cytokine coordinates immune responses to pathogens including viruses, microbes, and vaccines.
Unusually high levels of this can spark an increase in white blood cells causing inflammation.
A similar thing happens when some young men develop myocarditis or pericarditis after getting the vaccines.
Senior study author Carrie Lucas, an associate professor of immunobiology at Yale University School of Medicine, said: ""It's a little bit of a double-edged sword.""
She noted that the vaccinated individuals mount a strong immune response, but that response is also causing ""cells to overreact and cause tissue inflammation.""
There was no proof of antibodies that target the virus’ spike protein causing heart inflammation.
Another author of the study and Yale’s immunologist Akiko Iwasaki said: “Our findings point to inflammation-induced heart damage and rule out elevated levels of anti-spike antibodies in patients.""
Dr Ofer Levy, the director of the Precision Vaccines Programme at Boston Children's Hospital is optimistic about the findings despite the small size of the research.
He noted: The research could provide insight into developing treatments for vaccine-induced myocarditis. There are currently no drugs for the condition, though most people fully recover on their own.
Levy who was not part of the research said: “The better we understand what the vaccine is doing, the better we can build a better mousetrap.”
Dr Leslie Cooper, the chair of the cardiology department at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, said the findings suggest that one potential treatment for the inflammation could be a drug that targets the body's excess immune response after vaccination.
The condition usually occurs in male teens and young adults after the second dose of the COVID, however, these vaccines are not in use as the US Food and Drug Administration switched to the updated bivalent formula.
Iwasaki said that other vaccines and viral infections can also cause myocarditis.
Novavax vaccine receivers also reported myocarditis which does not use mRNA technology and COVID itself is more likely to cause heart inflammation than the vaccine.
While the study helps explain what is driving the inflammation in people who got an mRNA vaccine, a number of questions remain.
Lucas, the senior study author, said the findings don’t explain why the inflammation only appears to affect the heart and not other organs. Nor do they explain why the condition affects men more than women.
The researchers said they hope larger trials will confirm their findings, although they noted that finding more participants could be difficult as the condition is very rare. 
While there is currently no conclusive evidence linking the vaccine to tinnitus, theories have emerged among researchers

184,"Mediterranean Diet: 5 Go-to Healthy Snacks, According to Dietitian",https://www.insider.com/mediterranean-diet-healthy-snack-ideas-2023-5,"Jump to




The Mediterranean diet is widely considered one of the healthiest ways to eat. Vegetables, legumes, seafood, and olive oil are key components of it. Wine is OK in moderation, but processed and fried foods, red meat, refined grains, added sugars, and saturated fats are discouraged.
Kirsten Jackson, a registered dietitian, previously told Insider that she followed the Mediterranean diet, sharing her favorite breakfasts, lunches, and dinners on the eating plan.
When snacking, Jackson aims to eat whole foods that provide protein and fiber, often incorporating fruit or vegetables.
Here, she tells Insider about her go-to snacks.
Roasted chickpeas are a good alternative to chips, Jackson said.
They are a great source of protein and fiber, she said, and are easy to make: Simply drain canned chickpeas, pour them into a baking tray, drizzle them with olive oil, and season with salt, pepper, and spices. Then bake until crisp.
Jackson makes her own trail mix by combining dark chocolate, dried fruit, nuts, and seeds.
Dark chocolate has multiple benefits, including boosting heart health.
Apple slices with peanut butter are a satiating snack thanks to a combination of fiber, fat, and protein.
Having nuts or nut butter alongside fruit is much more filling than fruit alone, a dietitian previously told Insider.
If you don't have time to chop carrots, peppers, cucumber, or celery, Jackson recommends buying precut vegetables.
Combining veggies with hummus makes the snack more filling than vegetables alone.
Jackson also snacks on oatcakes with peanut butter. She aims to always eat complex carbohydrates — such as oats, sweet potatoes, brown bread, and whole-grain pasta — because they contain more vitamins, minerals, and fiber than refined carbs including white bread, potatoes, and pasta.
If you're craving cookies, Jackson recommends looking out for chocolate oatcakes to help satisfy your sweet tooth too.

185,Work to start on new cancer treatment center in Camillus - syracuse.com,https://www.syracuse.com/business/2023/05/work-to-start-on-new-cancer-treatment-center-in-camillus.html,"Hematology-Oncology Associates will break ground on Monday, May 8, 2023, on a 21,000-square-foot cancer treatment center at 5490 Cobbler Way, Camillus. (Bennetts & Huysman Architects)
Camillus, N.Y. — Hematology-Oncology Associates of CNY will break ground today on a 21,000-square-foot cancer treatment center in Camillus.
The new building at 5490 Cobbler Way will replace HOA’s smaller cancer center on Onondaga Hill and its wellness center in Camillus. It is expected to open in late 2024.
“Providing our patients with the best possible care includes a modern, spacious location where they can conveniently and cost-effectively receive all their cancer care, rather than traveling to different locations,” said CEO Maryann Roefaro.
She said the new center will offer a full range of oncology care, including infusion services for cancer and other needs, radiation therapy, medical imaging, nutrition counseling, and laboratory and pharmacy services. In addition, it will house a wellness center for holistic care and classes for cancer patients and the community, she said.
The facility will also have plenty of parking for patients, something the Onondaga Hill center is short on, she said.
Roefaro said the practice has outgrown the Onondaga Hill facility. That center has 12 bays for patients receiving chemotherapy, while the new facility will have 29, she said.
HOA was founded 41 years ago and employs 320 people, including 20 physicians, many of whom are partners in the practice.
Its other cancer centers are in Auburn and DeWitt.
The new center’s design team includes Bennetts & Huysman Architects, St. Germain & Aupperle Consulting Engineers, RAM-TECH Engineers and landscape architect Terry Horst. Rich & Gardner Construction Co. is the project’s general contractor.

186,Still dealing with long COVID? This treatment may help | KSL.com,https://www.ksl.com/article/50632609/still-dealing-with-long-covid-this-treatment-may-help,"

                                        minutes
While the COVID-19 pandemic may seem like it's in the rearview mirror, many people are still struggling with long-term effects of the disease.
At one point in 2022, the CDC reported that 1 in 5 adults who contracted the virus were still experiencing long COVID. The numbers have decreased since then, but the effects of long COVID can be debilitating for those still suffering.
The medical community has taken notice and options for long COVID treatment are available. Aspen Orthopedic Pain and Spine is offering groundbreaking treatment for people suffering for months—or even years—with long COVID.
Understanding the effects of long COVID
Long COVID can wreak havoc on your body and your daily life. The name was coined in the early days of the pandemic after people experiencing lingering symptoms of the disease called themselves ""long haulers."" The United States Department of Health and Human Services says, ""Long COVID is not one condition. It represents many potentially overlapping entities, likely with different biological causes and different sets of risk factors and outcomes.""
When someone experiences an especially severe case of COVID-19, the chance of experiencing lasting or multiorgan effects is even greater. You might become more likely to develop conditions like diabetes, heart problems, or neurological problems.
A new treatment to alleviate suffering
One of the most prevalent symptoms of COVID is the loss of taste and smell, also called parosmia. Everyday life can be miserable—even maddening—when your basic human senses are nonfunctioning!
Stellate Ganglion Block (SGB) is a nerve-blocking treatment that has seen promising results in long COVID patients. SGB is a proven treatment typically used for chronic pain management, headaches, excess sweating, and even PTSD. It's a simple injection into the bundle of nerves at the base of the neck that helps block signals from your sympathetic nervous system. With long COVID patients, it can act as a reset button for your nervous system, helping to regain your sense of taste and smell.
A 2022 study from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center is just one study backing this up. According to the study's authors, ""Stellate ganglion block (SGB) can diminish the increased sympathetic activity and potentially resolve anosmia [loss of smell] and dysgeusia [taste disorder] occurring due to long COVID.""
Make an appointment with Aspen Orthopedic Pain and Spine
Dr. Greg Condie at Aspen Orthopedic Pain and Spine is determined to restore your life with optimal functionality and movement. Treatment aims to help patients to regain control of their life, one step at a time. Condie and his staff provide quality care to Murray and the surrounding community by focusing on the root cause of pain.
Additionally, Aspen Orthopedic Pain and Spine is the only place in Utah where you can receive this treatment for long COVID. Utah has a handful of clinics focused on long COVID treatment, but they specialize in mitigating lingering effects of the virus (think respiratory therapy, etc.) rather than the whole-body, holistic approach that Aspen Orthopedic and Spine offers.
Early treatment improves your quality of life in both the short and long term, so don't put off getting the help you need. Schedule an appointment with Aspen Orthopedic Pain and Spine and take back control of your life.",1

She Hydrates



Aniston drinks a whopping 100 ounces of water per day. ""But occasionally I just have to have a Diet Coke—there's nothing like it!"" According to the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine men should drink about 15.5 cups (3.7 liters) of fluids a day and women about 11.5 cups (2.7 liters) of fluids.
 


7 
She Spikes Her Coffee with Collagen



Aniston adds collagen peptides to her coffee.  ""I've always been an advocate for finding wellness from the inside out – and I'm so happy to share the importance of collagen,"" she revealed. ""Though we may not all be blessed with the genetics of Jennifer Aniston, we can still reap the potential benefits of collagen peptides, which she swears by. The star has said she puts a scoop in her smoothie each morning to keep her skin youthful and her body limber,"" says the Cleveland Clinic. ""Taking collagen peptides — also known as hydrolyzed collagen or collagen hydrolysate — can help prevent unwelcome health woes by replenishing some of your body's collagen supply.""

Diabetes regimens, from Ozempic to old mainstays like insulin and metformin, appear to address several different aspects of the metabolic system implicated in Alzheimer's disease, including a protein called amyloid and inflammation, researchers say.
The hope is that improving glucose utilisation and tamping down inflammation in the entire body - including the brain - could slow progression of debilitating diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.
Several scientists interviewed by Reuters pointed to mounting research supporting testing diabetes drugs against neurodegenerative diseases.
Results are years away and success uncertain. But interest has been buoyed by recent positive data on Alzheimer's drugs developed by Eisai Co Ltd (4523.T) with partner Biogen (BIIB.O) and by Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N) demonstrating that removing sticky amyloid plaques accumulated in the brain can slow cognition decline caused by the fatal mind-wasting disease.
Those successes followed decades of futility that had left many questioning the validity of the amyloid theory behind most experimental Alzheimer's drugs.
Dr. Suzanne Craft, professor of gerontology and geriatric medicine at Wake Forest University School of Medicine, gave a keynote speech at an influential Alzheimer's scientific meeting late last year about the need to test treatments such as diabetes drugs to further reduce the advance of Alzheimer's.
She said she has since been approached by pharmaceutical companies at an increasing pace, and is currently running an Alzheimer’s trial evaluating intranasal insulin in combination with another diabetes drug.
Diabetes treatments may amplify the clinical benefit of anti-amyloid drugs, and potentially lead to complete stabilization or even some recovery in Alzheimer's patients, Craft said.
""This is what these agents do, and what insulin does. It plays a role in regeneration. And that's what needs to happen. Given its role in modulating immune function, it may prevent the amyloid from continuing to accumulate,"" Craft surmised.
Unlike older off-patent medicines like metformin, there is commercial incentive to test newer treatments such as GLP-1 agonists, a rapidly expanding class now dominated by Ozempic, known chemically as semaglutide, and Lilly's Mounjaro, with other players working on a dozen potential new treatments.
Four companies with GLP-1 drugs, including two larger drugmakers, say they are watching for results of trials testing Novo's drug in Alzheimer's.
Ivan Koychev, consultant neuropsychiatrist for Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, is running a trial testing semaglutide with the aim of halting the earliest changes in the brains of people at risk of developing Alzheimer's.
GLP-1s are his primary focus, he said, because there is ""good epidemiological evidence that they are linked to lower risk for dementia but run much lower risk of serious side-effects relative to the amyloid clearance therapies.""
Anti-amyloid therapies carry the risk of dangerous brain swelling.
Any success could lead to a big payoff. Dementia affects more than 55 million people globally and the market for Alzheimer’s drugs is expected to grow to $9.4 billion by 2028 and for Parkinson’s to $6.6 billion, according to pharmaceutical data provider Citeline.
Despite their potential against Alzheimer's, early research has yielded mixed results, cautioned Hannah Churchill, research communications manager at the Alzheimer's Society.
""It's definitely worth pursuing, but it's difficult to know whether this is a front-runner at this stage,"" she said.
Novo in 2021 began two trials testing semaglutide - also sold for weight loss as Wegovy - in thousands of patients with early Alzheimer’s. Results are expected by 2025 as it takes years to show an effect on the progressive condition.
The Danish drugmaker declined to be interviewed for this story.
""Everyone is waiting to see what that might show. Investors want somebody else to first take the risk in Alzheimer’s, like Novo,"" said Ted Dawson, professor of neurology at John Hopkins University and co-founder of Neuraly, which has an experimental GLP-1 drug.
Lilly told Reuters it is watching that trial closely. Pfizer (PFE.N), which has experimental GLP-1s, also has its eye on Novo.
Smaller companies, including U.S.-based Neuraly and Denmark-based Kariya Pharmaceuticals, said they are evaluating experimental GLP-1 drugs against Parkinson’s and could consider moving onto Alzheimer’s should the Novo trial bear fruit.
Parkinson's trials tend to take less time and may require fewer patients because it's easier to assess the impact on motor function characteristics of the disease to understand whether the treatments benefit the brain.
Wassilios Meissner, head of the department of neurology for neurodegenerative diseases at University Hospital Bordeaux, is involved in a mid-stage Parkinson's trial testing Sanofi's (SASY.PA) GLP-1 lixisenatide.
Meissner said postmortem research of the brains of both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's patients shows insulin signalling is impaired.
""That means that these pathways that provide support to the brain are dysfunctional,"" he said. ""So people have started questioning whether there might be an interest for anti-diabetics for the treatment of these disorders.""

190,Skin cancer awareness month: Mother left ‘looking like Freddy Krueger’ after Bowen’s disease skin cancer reveals first warning sign | The Independent,https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/skin-cancer-symptoms-bowens-freddy-kruegerhe-b2334767.html,"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged inPlease refresh your browser to be logged in
Melissa Lewis, 48, says her own children find it hard to look at her after treatment

A woman who says skin cancer treatment has left her looking like Freddy Krueger is urging others to respect the sun.
Melissa Lewis, 48, has been living with skin cancer for more than a decade.
She has annual treatment which gives her skin a pockmarked look, which she has compared to that of Krueger, a fictional killer.
Melissa, from Sydney, Australia, hopes the yearly procedure will keep her cancer at bay.
But she wants to speak out to warn others of the harm sun exposure can do, before it’s too late.
The mum-of-four, a former nurse, said: “When they said I have Bowen’s disease I thought that was it.
“When I looked it up I was like, ‘Oh my god, I am never going to be free’. It is something I have to keep on top of.
“I have treatment once a year. I hate it, it is really stressful as I know my skin will hurt.
“I will have up to 14 days looking like Freddy Krueger, I can’t go out in public.
“I look at my own kids when I have had the treatment and they find it hard to look at me.
“I tell them that this is why you put sunscreen on, this is why you are careful.”
Melissa first spotted a basal cell carcinoma - a sign of skin cancer - on her leg in 2011.
She has since found them on her forehead, nose, chest and back and has lost count of how many have been removed.
But in 2018, Melissa discovered what looked like a group of freckles lumped together in front of her ear.
Thinking it was best to get it checked out, she paid a visit to her dermatologist.
Melissa was then referred her to the Melanoma Institute in June 2018 - which confirmed she had a melanoma.
“I was very lucky to have caught it when I did,” she said.
“It did make me think that, ‘This is it’. The dread I experienced when I heard that word was really intense.
“Having four kids thinking I am not going to be there with them was so overwhelming.
“You automatically fast forward to the worst-case scenario.”
A month after her diagnosis, Melissa had her melanoma removed.
And, two months after her surgery, a biopsy revealed Melissa had Bowen’s disease - an early form of skin cancer.
Melissa said: “I am never going to be free from this.
“Basically if I don’t have my cancers removed, it can become a more serious invasive cancer.”
Since she was diagnosed with Bowen’s syndrome, Melissa undergoes a yearly none-surgical cancer treatment - Photodynamic therapy.
Photodynamic therapy is a treatment that involves light-sensitive medicine and a light source to destroy abnormal cells.
Melissa said: “I hate it, I get really anxious before I know I am coming up for treatment.
“It is really stressful as I know how much it hurts.
“My future will be to repeat expensive Photodynamic therapy with CO2 laser every year and always six monthly full skin checks.
“It will be the only way to prevent further surgery and keep non-melanoma skin cancers from becoming invasive cancer.”

191,Meritus doctor expects RSV vaccine in Hagerstown by end of month,https://www.heraldmailmedia.com/story/news/local/2023/05/08/meritus-doctor-expects-rsv-vaccine-in-hagerstown-md-by-end-of-month/70184447007/,"Many people don't know about respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV.
And in many ways, that makes sense.
It largely goes unnoticed because in most cases, it results in a common cold, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
But Anand Budi, a longtime pediatrician and chief medical officer for Meritus Health, is seeing worrisome trends with the virus.
Budi said he's diagnosing more cases of RSV locally, and people are getting sicker from it, and their hospitalizations to treat it are getting longer.
Now he said last week that the health care profession is starting to breathe a sigh of relief since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday approved the first vaccine for RSV.
It's been a long time coming because the virus was first discovered in 1956. Hope for a vaccine started to ramp up in the 1980s when a greater understanding of the virus began to unfold. Last year, excitement began to build over a possible vaccine when six drug companies reported they were working on RSV vaccines or antibodies, according to Budi and other health professionals.
The vaccine approved by the FDA on Wednesday is Arexvy, which will be used to protect adults 60 years old and up, one of two segments of the population most susceptible to the virus. The other population is infants and younger children.
Outbreaks of respiratory illnesses caused by RSV typically start in the fall and peak in the winter, although the timing and severity of them can vary, according to the CDC.
In older adults, RSV causes more than 177,000 hospitalizations a year and approximately 14,000 deaths.
Budi said he expects the first shipments of the Arexvy vaccine to arrive in Washington County pharmacies and physician's offices later this month.
He said a vaccine for children is still being developed, a process that is often ""secretly guarded.""
There is not a concern about developing a vaccination for middle-aged people because health care professionals believe that targeting the two most susceptible populations will be the most effective way to control the virus, Budi said.
The need for a childhood RSV vaccine is illustrated by the large numbers of kids becoming ill from the virus.
Recently, there have been waiting lists up to ""70 kids at a time"" to get children proper treatment in hospitals, Budi said. And last October and November, Meritus Medical Center near Hagerstown was transferring infected children to hospitals in cities like Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and Morgantown, W.Va., because it was running out of the facilities it needed.
""It's starting to become a lot more of a problem in the last decade,"" Budi said.
Other RSV vaccines and treatments under review by regulatory agencies include:",1

Michelle Davis, 52, was shocked after discovering that a seemingly harmless pimple on her nose was actually skin cancer. The account manager from Orewa, New Zealand, first noticed the red pimple in April 2022 and thought it was just a spot. She would cover it up with concealer, according to Express UK. “It was really hard. Like a volcano under the skin,"" she said, ""I went walking with my girlfriend and it went purple and she pointed it out. I said, ‘It’s just a pimple’.”
​(Representative image)
The spot became “really sore” by January 2023. Davis tried to squeeze the spot, something many people end up doing to their 'pimples'. She said, “Nothing happened. Then it bled and bled. I thought ‘That’s not normal’.”
(Representative image)
Davis' doctor immediately thought it was cancer, A biopsy confirmed that she had basal cell carcinoma – a common form of non-melanoma skin cancer. “I was in shock when I found out,” she said. “I had never heard of basal cell carcinoma.” Michelle underwent a nasal flap reconstruction in April this year to remove the cancer.
​(Representative image)
“They cut up my nose in a zig zag. They cut out a crater. There was a hole in the end of my nose. They then bring the skin down to cover it,” Davis explained. Michelle was left with scarring and asymmetrical nostrils.
​​(Representative image)
Michelle is trying to raise awareness of this seemingly harmless symptom so other people can get it checked out before it is too late. “If I’d kept ignoring it, it would have got way bigger. I might have got to the stage where they couldn’t cut it out,"" she said. “I honestly thought it was a pimple. I thought skin cancer was a mole. Skin block wasn't a thing when I was growing up. Now it's in my day to day skin care.""

The most common symptom of this type of skin cancer is a lump or discolored patch on the skin that persists after a few weeks and slowly progresses over months or sometimes even years. According to the NHS UK, in most cases, cancerous lumps are red, firm and sometimes turn into ulcers. Cancerous patches are usually flat and scaly.

A research group from Helsinki University named the strains of a bacteria called Desulfovibrio as a likely cause of Parkinson’s disease, according to an article originally published in the scientific journal Frontier in Cellular and Infection Microbiology.
Despite more than 200 years of research, the development of Parkinson’s disease has remained a mystery. However, researchers at Helsinki University claim they have found the key, adding that genes play only a minor role.
The study, conducted in a group that included Parkinson’s patients and healthy individuals, may also pave the way for preventing the disease or at least potentially alleviating and slowing its symptoms. The carriers of Desulfovibrio can be screened, and the bacteria can be removed from the gut.
”The disease is primarily caused by environmental factors, that is, environmental exposure to the Desulfovibrio bacterial strains that cause Parkinson’s disease. Only a small share, or roughly 10%, of Parkinson’s disease, is caused by individual genes,” said Professor Per Saris in a University of Helsinki press release.
Parkinson’s disease deteriorates part of the brain and affects muscle control, balance and movement. There are also effects on the senses, mental health and thinking ability. It is more common among men and usually starts around 60. At least 1% of people older than 60 suffer from the disease worldwide, according to experts’ estimates.

195,The Breathing Technique That Could Reduce Your Risk Of Alzheimer's | HuffPost UK Life,https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/the-breathing-technique-that-could-reduce-your-risk-of-alzheimers_uk_64539cede4b0452cee9bc9ca,"
Alzheimer’s is a complex disease, often known in the later stages as being characterised by confusion, memory loss, and problems with speech or language. 
However, the condition, which is most common in people over 65, can also result in poor judgement, not recognising loved ones and in late stages, incontinence and difficulties in swallowing food. 
Currently, according to the NHS, 1 in 14 people over 65 and 1 in 6 people over 80 are at risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease and 1 in 20 people with the disease are under the age of 65. However, according to new research by Professor Mara Mather at SC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, a simple breathing exercise could reduce people’s risk of developing Alzheimer’s Disease.
Published in Nature Journal, the study asked participants to do one simple thing: inhale for a count of five, exhale for a count of five for 20 minutes, twice a day, for four weeks. Though simple, these breathing techniques had profound impacts on the participant’s breathing. Their heart rates variability increased during each exercise period and the levels of amyloid-beta peptides in their bloodstream decreased by the time the four week period was over. 
These peptides are connected to Alzheimer’s and in fact, some experts believe that they are the main cause of the degenerative disease.
Our heart rate can be affected by our breathing which then impacts our nervous system and the way that our brain produces and removes proteins. While we’re awake and active, we use our sympathetic nervous system – often known as ‘fight or flight’ – to make memories and help us to focus and pay attention. 
While this system is activated, there isn’t often variation between heartbeats but when the parasympathetic system is activated, heart rates increase during inhaling and decrease during exhaling. 
When people are younger, it’s much easier to switch between these two systems without trouble but as we age, this switch becomes a little more difficult and unless you’re extremely fit, heart rate variation will take a sizeable dip. 
In fact, a 2020 study found that heart rate drops by an average of 80% between the ages of 20 and 60 years old. 
The study that was conducted with 108 participants - half of them being age 18 to 30 and the other half being 55 to 80 - is the first one to find that behavioural interventions can reduce amyloid beta peptides in plasma and it shows promise for future Alzheimer’s treatment.
“At least to date, exercise interventions have not decreased Aβ [amyloid beta] levels,” said Mather. “Regularly practising slow-paced breathing via HRV biofeedback may be a low-cost and low-risk way to reduce plasma Aβ levels and to keep them low throughout adulthood.”

Long COVID patients enrolled in a study at Stanford University have walked out because the staff were not wearing masks while tending to them.
The participants were enrolled in a clinical study into whether the drug Paxlovid works to reduce the symptoms of long COVID.
Over the course of the 15-week study, participants were expected to visit the clinic in-person on five separate occasions, but after masking requirements were dropped multiple participants said the researchers stopped covering their faces.
The walkouts were first mentioned on April 28 in a Reddit post on a forum for those suffering from long COVID.

The lead investigators on the Stanford Medicine study, clinical assistant professor, Linda Geng (left), and professor of Infectious Disease, Upinder Singh (right), did not comment on the walkouts but a spokesperson for Stanford Medicine said 'wearing masks in all clinical settings is no longer mandated'
'We've been traveling hundreds of miles for months in order to try to participate in their study and provide THEM with data about the illness, and this is what they think of us,' wrote the Reddit user, whose wife was a participant in the study, according to the Daily Beast.
'It's frankly abhorrent, selfish behavior, and not only does it demonstrate a complete lack of regard and understanding for the illness in question, in my opinion it calls into question the legitimacy of the entire study,' they added.
Masking is no longer mandated by the California Department of Public Health and Santa Clara County Public Health, where the Stanford Infectious Disease Clinic is located and where the trial was held.
The Daily Beast spoke with at least two people in the study who withdrew due to the lack of masks. When reached by publication, Stanford Medicine would only confirm that one patient in the Paxlovid trial pulled out over concerns around masks.
'I knew that mask mandates were dropped, but I naively assumed that staff interacting with long COVID patients would still wear masks,' Olivia H., a patient in the trial who requested her full last name be withheld for privacy reasons, told The Daily Beast.
'I was really disappointed when the research assistant and nurse entered my room without a mask on,' she added.
'I would expect that all staff involved in the trial would understand that long COVID patients are fundamentally immunocompromised, and they would take necessary steps to protect what little health we have left from further deteriorating,' she said.
The lead investigators of the trial, clinical assistant professor, Linda Geng, and professor of Infectious Disease, Upinder Singh, did not respond to requests for comment. 
Vinay Prasad, a professor of epidemiology at the University of California in San Francisco, questioned why participants would be concerned about contracting COVID if they had already contracted the virus 
After participants in the study first started speaking out against the trial, some doctors criticized them for overreacting, including Jeffrey Bien, an oncologist with Stanford Medicine.
'Be careful or you'll upset the super secret ultra-double-long-Covid community,' wrote Bien on Twitter on April 30, according to the Daily Beast. 
Bien was responding to a tweet from Vinay Prasad, a professor of epidemiology at the University of California in San Francisco.
He questioned the disgruntled participants, writing: 'I am confused. If you already got COVID and already developed long covid then what does the mask do?'
Long COVID is a little-understood condition that causes some people to experience some symptoms of the illness for long after first getting ill - for months, years and potentially longer.
The technical term for the syndrome is 'post-acute sequelae of COVID,' or PASC, but doctors and researchers commonly refer to it as long COVID. 
More than 16 million people have developed long-COVID since 2019 and it is thought to affect between 5 and 30 percent of those that contract COVID-19, according to Stanford Medicine. 
However, since the illness is not well understood or defined, it is difficult to quantify exactly how many people have been affected with any certainty.

Symptoms generally include chronic fatigue and exhaustion, brain fog, light sensitivity, shortness of breath, stomach issues, and heart palpitations.
'I was (and still am) severely ill, and was excited to enroll in the trial as it would provide me with the chance to ease or eliminate some of my symptoms and participate in a trial that millions of long COVID sufferers are hopeful about,' Olivia H. told the Daily Beast. 
'To me it almost seems logical, that long COVID patients in a long COVID trial need to be protected from the virus that triggered their illness in the first place.' 
Though the two lead investigators involved in the Stanford clinical study did not comment, a spokesperson for Stanford Medicine said in a statement: 'In accordance with the California Department of Public Health and Santa Clara County Public Health, wearing masks in all clinical settings is no longer mandated, but recommended.
'We continue to recommend and support masking and make masks available for health care workers, patients and visitors at our care facilities.'

Your 20s are probably too early.,https://slate.com/technology/2023/05/should-you-freeze-eggs-twenties-early-cost-ivf.html,"Isabel Medina had never thought about freezing her eggs, but she was listening to a podcast about personal finance when the hosts brought up the procedure. They referred to it as an insurance policy for your future self. Medina was intrigued: She loves planning and having peace of mind.
Medina is 25, thriving in her job, and about to start her master’s degree in computational data science. But she doesn’t know whether she wants to have children—or when in her life it would happen.
“That was the first time I thought this might buy me some time to consider all the possibilities,” she says. She’s not the only one her age thinking about this.
Ella Kauter, a 29-year-old Pilates instructor living in Sydney, was told by her mom she should consider the procedure; she joined an egg-freezing Facebook group to learn more. And the exact same thing happened to María Ramírez, a 27-year-old graduate student in New Haven, and a friend of a friend of mine.
Fertility clinics have a clear business case for trying to convince as many people as possible that egg freezing is something every smart woman should do, like saving up for retirement or having car insurance. Some target women in their twenties, with blog posts and social media posts making the case that when it comes to egg freezing, the earlier the better. TikTok influencers, some as young as 25 at the time, have also shared their “egg-freezing journeys.”
Most experts agree that anyone who pursues egg freezing should ideally do so before age 35. And while there is no consensus about when is too early to freeze, the benefits of doing so in your 20s probably don’t outweigh the added costs and uncertainty. Freezing before 30 might, biologically, improve the odds that a frozen egg could successfully turn into an embryo and then a child. But this improvement would be small—and is probably not enough to justify paying additional annual storage fees for the eggs. In addition, the possibility that the eggs will not be used at all goes way up.
There are two main reasons a woman’s fertility declines with age, says Dr. Sarah Cascante, a fellow in reproductive endocrinology and infertility at NYU Langone Infertility Center. The first is that the number of eggs a woman has starts decreasing the moment she’s born. Every year, that number goes down.
The second reason is egg quality. Younger women are more likely to produce eggs that will form healthy embryos, without birth defects. “So, if you’re older, you’re more likely to get chromosomal problems that are more likely to either result in a miscarriage or not produce a baby at all,” Cascante says. The idea with egg freezing is that you can preserve egg quality, and potentially have a successful pregnancy later in life.
Although there is consensus on the fact that women’s fertility declines with age, the rate of that decline is not constant. “We are very concerned about aging, but it’s quite stable towards age 33 or 34,” says Dr. Avi Tsafrir, a fertility specialist at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Before then, your chances of getting pregnant from one year to the next are pretty even. (Even 35 is not a hard-and-fast point at which fertility falls off a cliff—the decline varies from person to person.)
“Whether you freeze your eggs at 25 or 32, it doesn’t really matter because you’ll probably get the same number and the same quality,” says Dr. Alex Polyakov, a fertility specialist at the University of Melbourne in Australia.
The egg-freezing procedure starts with a woman (or a person with a uterus) getting hormone injections that stimulate her ovaries to produce more eggs. Usually, the patient will go through tests and ultrasounds and, when the eggs are ready, the doctor will induce ovulation and pick up the eggs through the vagina a few days later. Then, the eggs will be immersed in liquid nitrogen, which will keep them frozen at -350 F.
Once the patient is ready to have a baby, doctors will defrost the eggs, fertilize them, and put the embryos back into the person’s uterus. “We don’t expect for all of them to survive,” says Tsafrir. Eggs get discarded at every step of the process, which is why egg freezing is never a guarantee and the number of eggs the patient freezes matters.
A study published earlier this year extrapolated data from 520 insemination cycles performed at a fertility clinic in Boston to estimate, according to a patient’s age, how many eggs a person needs to achieve a live birth. Based on the success rates of those in their sample, the authors predicted that someone freezing 20 eggs at age 34 has a 92 percent chance of achieving a live birth if they undergo in vitro fertilization, while someone freezing the same amount at 30 has a 98 percent chance—only a slight improvement. A 2015 paper, titled “Optimal Timing for Elective Egg Freezing,” used data from several sources—a long-term pregnancy study, the National Survey of Family Growth, and the Assisted Reproductive Technology National Summary—to examine the question of when people should ideally freeze their eggs. It found that egg freezing prior to 32 doesn’t generally improve your chances of having a live birth.
It’s worth noting that because egg freezing is typically done by older women, much of the information we have on younger women and egg freezing is not from actual patients’ data but from models making a best guess. Although most doctors believe that egg freezing isn’t typically necessary before a woman’s early 30s, they would feel more confident with more data.
In addition to unclear benefits, freezing eggs in your 20s comes with some clear disadvantages. The first one is the cost. With egg freezing, you pay not only for the egg retrieval but also for the time your eggs will be in storage. The longer you keep your eggs frozen, the more you will have to pay. At NYU Langone, for instance, the cost is $1,000 for every year they stay in storage.
Then there’s the fact that the majority of women who freeze their eggs don’t go back for them. Some papers and researchers estimate that the return rate is between 9 and 30 percent, though they don’t know the percentage for sure because the procedure hasn’t been around for that long. Younger women might be even less likely to retrieve their eggs, Polyakov says.
A small study published in 2021 found that women typically don’t use their frozen eggs for two reasons: They never found a suitable partner (and didn’t want to raise a child without one) or they got pregnant naturally. You might feel, at 28, as if you’ll be single forever, but there’s still plenty of time to find a partner before your fertility starts to decline. Even for women who are not heterosexual or who plan to have kids via IVF to, say, screen for a particular disease, seeing if you can wait to undergo egg retrieval until you’re ready to have a family still may make the most sense. Egg storage is expensive, testing embryos is more efficient, and also, plans can always change.
Cascante recommends that women have a good idea of what their 30s and 40s are going to look like before they freeze their eggs. For example, egg freezing might make sense for someone who is 27, wants to be a general surgeon, and is going to postpone childbearing 15 years for medical training. But the calculation will be different for someone postponing motherhood for a less certain reason. “If someone says, ‘I’m 27—I really want to have kids as soon as I meet somebody,’ for that person, I might say, ‘Wait until you are 32 or 33, then let’s see where you are,’ ” says Cascante. Early egg freezing may also make sense for women who are undergoing a treatment like chemotherapy or for trans men who plan to undergo gender-affirming surgery or take gender-affirming hormones.
If you’re around 30 and considering egg freezing, doctors recommend taking an ovarian reserve test, which is a blood test that measures hormones to estimate how many eggs you might get during an egg retrieval. This test can indicate if there is a reason to hurry. “If you come in and your level is low at 30, and you wait until you are 35, you will probably have a very low level. And at that point, you may not get so many eggs from egg freezing,” Cascante says. Freezing your eggs is never a guarantee that you’ll have a baby or that you’ll consider it money well spent. But it’s better to do it with some data in hand, rather than simply out of fear.

199,"Child in Maine tests positive for measles, first case in state since 2019 | CNN",https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/07/us/maine-measles-child-tests-positive/index.html,"
      A child in Maine has tested positive for measles, officials said, marking the first case in the state since 2019.  
  

      The child who tested positive had received a dose of the measles vaccine, but the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention said in a news release Friday that it “is considering the child to be infectious out of an abundance of caution.”
  

      The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends all children get two doses of the MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine; the first dose between 12 to 15 months of age and the second between the ages of 4 to 6.
  

      Some people may still get measles if they have received the vaccine, but those individuals typically have a milder version of the illness and are less likely to be contagious, according to the CDC.
  

Measles vaccinations rate at lowest point since 2008, study finds


      The Maine CDC listed several locations where others could have been exposed to measles, including a “Family Time Dine and Play” at a mall and two medical centers between April 29 through May 1. The agency says anyone at the locations should watch for symptoms for 21 days and call a health provider immediately if they experience any symptoms.
  

      Babies and young children are more likely to get “very sick” from measles, the Maine CDC said on its Facebook page. 
  

      The agency said it was still waiting for official confirmation of the positive case from the US CDC, according to the news release.
  

      The US CDC said there has been 10 documented cases of measles in eight states so far this year. The case in Maine was the first since 2019, according to the state’s Department of Health and Human Services.


      Measles was declared eliminated from the US in 2000, thanks to an intensive vaccination program, according to the US CDC’s website. But vaccination rates in the US have dropped in recent years, sparking new outbreaks. An outbreak that began in November in Ohio sickened 85 children, none of whom were fully vaccinated.
  

      The disease is highly contagious: Up to 90% of unvaccinated people who are exposed to the virus will also become infected, according to the US CDC.

201,The Syndrome That Could Be A Precursor To Multiple Sclerosis,https://www.healthdigest.com/1276493/ris-syndrome-precursor-multiple-sclerosis/,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease where the immune system mistakenly attacks the protective sheaths around the nerve fibers (via Mayo Clinic). This damages the nerve fibers, which disrupts the communication of signals between the brain and the rest of the body. Although each person with MS can experience different symptoms that can come and go, many people with MS experience muscle weakness, difficulty with coordination, and cognitive issues.


Although the cause of MS isn't known, researchers are looking into how the disease progresses in the body. A possible precursor to MS is called radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS). People with RIS don't have symptoms of MS, but show similar lesions on the brain or spinal cord, according to a 2020 article in the American Journal of Neuroradiology. Typically, these lesions are found during an MRI scan when someone has experienced headache, head trauma, or dizziness. It's unknown how many people might have RIS, since it's only found during an MRI. RIS is more likely in healthy relatives of people with MS.
According to My MS Team, some researchers believe RIS reflects the same condition as MS, and that RIS is a precursor to the MS. However, not all people with RIS develop MS.

Researchers are also looking into why some people with RIS develop MS and some don't. According to a 2020 study in the Annals of Neurology, being male, younger, and having lesions on the spinal cord poses an increased risk of developing MS in five years. About half of the people with RIS could experience a clinical event. This clinical event is an episode of symptoms due to inflammation and deterioration of the casing around nerve cells (called demyelination), according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. These symptoms can include loss of vision, numbness, dizziness, or problems walking. In order to be classified as a clinical event, these symptoms must last for 24 hours. This first event is called clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), which is considered to be the first course of MS.

There is a possibility that the location of the lesions might predict MS. A 2011 study in Neurology found that 84% of RIS patients who had lesions on the cervical spine developed clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) or MS in less than two years.
Many times, RIS remains silent because the lesions might be in less critical areas, according to a 2022 review in Frontiers in Neurology. There also could be a low level of inflammation that might not cause symptoms, or the brain is trying to repair itself. Yet once an episode occurs, people might recognize previous symptoms in hindsight. The likelihood of this silent demyelination is usually higher in people who have family members with MS.

Because people with RIS don't experience any symptoms, a RIS diagnosis is difficult. If brain or spinal cord lesions are found in an MRI, then a doctor will look at your medical history and do a neurological examination (via Cedars Sinai). A spinal tap, spinal fluid analysis, and a test of your nerve function could also help diagnose or rule out RIS. Because there is no cure for RIS, your medical provider will continually observe you to see if there is any progression of the condition.

Because vitamin D supplements, preventing metabolic disorders, and quitting smoking have been linked to a reduced risk of MS, it's possible that these measures might also prevent RIS from progressing to MS, according to the 2022 review in Frontiers in Neurology. Clinical trials are underway looking for ways to treat the progression of RIS using medications such as teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, and ocrelizumab. A 2023 study presented at the American Academy of Neurology's annual meeting found that people with RIS who took teriflunomide reduced their risk of a clinical event by 63% compared to those given a placebo.

Scientists from the University of Michigan have published an intriguing paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). In the paper, the scientists detail how they detected an unknown and mysterious wave of brain activity in the brains of dying people.
The activity registered as a burst of ephemeral gamma activity similar to those seen in previous research that recorded the brain waves of a dying person just last year. The discovery unlocks more information about how the human brain reacts under tragic circumstances.

	









They recorded the mysterious brain activity when four patients were withdrawn from life support. They recorded the activity in two of the four patients, and it could help scientists better understand the parallels between a dying human brain and the brains of animals like rats, which have been studied before.
The belief is that these flickers of activity as the brain dies could be what we often refer to as “near-death experiences,” things like the flashing of your life before your eyes, something that many believe happens before you die. Of course, proving the existence of such mental movies isn’t easy, but it is something scientists have set out to do.
And this new research on mysterious brain activity could be a step in the right direction, at least when it comes to understanding how the brain reacts to the last moments before death. That’s why the researchers looked at how the brain’s activity changed from before doctors removed the patients from life support as well as after.
For now, though, the activity is not necessarily evidence of elevated conscious processing in the patients. Yes, it does seem to suggest as such, but it does not quite demonstrate it. Perhaps future research into the same area will yield additional results and information.

Summary: A recent study found that secondary bacterial pneumonia, rather than the much-discussed “cytokine storm,” is a significant factor in COVID-19-related fatalities. Almost half of the patients who required mechanical ventilation support were affected by this secondary bacterial infection. 
By applying machine learning to analyze medical records, the researchers found that those who recovered from secondary pneumonia were more likely to survive, whereas unresolved cases increased mortality risk. 
The study, which challenges the cytokine storm theory, emphasizes the importance of preventing and aggressively treating secondary bacterial pneumonia in critically ill patients.
Key Facts: 
Source: Northwestern University
Secondary bacterial infection of the lung (pneumonia) was extremely common in patients with COVID-19, affecting almost half the patients who required support from mechanical ventilation. 
By applying machine learning to medical record data, scientists at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine found that secondary bacterial pneumonia that does not resolve was a key driver of death in patients with COVID-19. It may even exceed death rates from the viral infection itself. 
The scientists also found evidence that COVID-19 does not cause a “cytokine storm,” so often believed to cause death.
The study was recently published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation. 
“Our study highlights the importance of preventing, looking for and aggressively treating secondary bacterial pneumonia in critically ill patients with severe pneumonia, including those with COVID-19,” said senior author Dr. Benjamin Singer, an associate professor of medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and a Northwestern Medicine pulmonary and critical care physician. 
The investigators found nearly half of patients with COVID-19 develop a secondary ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia. 
“Those who were cured of their secondary pneumonia were likely to live, while those whose pneumonia did not resolve were more likely to die,” Singer said.
“Our data suggested that the mortality related to the virus itself is relatively low, but other things that happen during the ICU stay, like secondary bacterial pneumonia, offset that.” 
The study findings also negate the cytokine storm theory, said Singer, also the Lawrence Hicks Professor of Pulmonary Medicine at Feinberg. 
“The term ‘cytokine storm’ means an overwhelming inflammation that drives organ failure in your lungs, your kidneys, your brain and other organs,” Singer said.
“If that were true, if cytokine storm were underlying the long length of stay we see in patients with COVID-19, we would expect to see frequent transitions to states that are characterized by multi-organ failure. That’s not what we saw.”
The study analyzed 585 patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) at Northwestern Memorial Hospital with severe pneumonia and respiratory failure, 190 of whom had COVID-19.
The scientists developed a new machine learning approach called CarpeDiem, which groups similar ICU patient-days into clinical states based on electronic health record data.
This novel approach, which is based on the concept of daily rounds by the ICU team, allowed them to ask how complications like bacterial pneumonia impacted the course of illness. 
These patients or their surrogates consented to enroll in the Successful Clinical Response to Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) study, an observational trial to identify new biomarkers and therapies for patients with severe pneumonia.
As part of SCRIPT, an expert panel of ICU physicians used state-of-the-art analysis of lung samples collected as part of clinical care to diagnose and adjudicate the outcomes of secondary pneumonia events. 
“The application of machine learning and artificial intelligence to clinical data can be used to develop better ways to treat diseases like COVID-19 and to assist ICU physicians managing these patients,” said study co-first author Dr. Catherine Gao, an instructor in pulmonary and critical care medicine at Feinberg and a Northwestern Medicine physician.
“The importance of bacterial superinfection of the lung as a contributor to death in patients with COVID-19 has been underappreciated because most centers have not looked for it or only look at outcomes in terms of presence or absence of bacterial superinfection, not whether treatment is successful or not,” said study co-author Dr. Richard Wunderink, who leads the Successful Clinical Response in Pneumonia Therapy Systems Biology Center at Northwestern.
The next step in the research will be to use molecular data from the study samples and integrate it with machine learning approaches to understand why some patients go on to be cured of pneumonia and some don’t.
Investigators also want to expand the technique to larger datasets and use the model to make predictions that can be brought back to the bedside to improve the care of critically ill patients.

Original Research: Open access.“Machine learning links unresolving secondary pneumonia to mortality in patients with severe pneumonia, including COVID-19” by Benjamin Singer et al. Journal of Clinical Investigation
Abstract
Machine learning links unresolving secondary pneumonia to mortality in patients with severe pneumonia, including COVID-19
BACKGROUND. Despite guidelines promoting the prevention and aggressive treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), the importance of VAP as a driver of outcomes in mechanically ventilated patients, including patients with severe COVID-19, remains unclear.  We aimed to determine the contribution of unsuccessful treatment of VAP to mortality in patients with severe pneumonia.
METHODS. We performed a single-center prospective cohort study of 585 mechanically ventilated patients with severe pneumonia and respiratory failure, 190 of whom had COVID-19, who underwent at least one bronchoalveolar lavage. A panel of ICU physicians adjudicated pneumonia episodes and endpoints based on clinical and microbiologic data. Given the relatively long ICU length of stay among patients with COVID-19, we developed a machine learning approach called CarpeDiem, which groups similar ICU patient-days into clinical states based on electronic health record data.
RESULTS.CarpeDiem revealed that the long ICU length of stay among patients with COVID-19 is attributable to long stays in clinical states characterized primarily by respiratory failure. While VAP was not associated with mortality overall, mortality was higher in patients with one episode of unsuccessfully treated VAP compared with successfully treated VAP (76.4% versus 17.6%, P < 0.001). In all patients, including those with COVID-19, CarpeDiem demonstrated that unresolving VAP was associated with transitions to clinical states associated with higher mortality.
CONCLUSIONS. Unsuccessful treatment of VAP is associated with greater mortality. The relatively long length of stay among patients with COVID-19 is primarily due to prolonged respiratory failure, placing them at higher risk of VAP.

204,Dementia: Losing grip strength may be a warning sign,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/losing-grip-strength-slowing-down-may-be-dementia-warning-signs,"It is a well-known fact that as we get older, we lose muscle mass. 
Researchers estimate humans begin to lose muscle mass in their 30s or 40s and lose about 10% of their muscle by the age of 50. Then from age 50 to 70, we lose another 30% of muscle strength. 
Now, researchers from Edith Cowan University in Australia have found evidence suggesting a loss of muscle strength may also be a signal for older people developing dementia — an umbrella term for diseases impacting a person’s cognitive ability. 
The researchers used grip strength and Timed Up and Go (TUG) as measures of muscle strength.
The study was published in the Journal of Cachexia Sarcopenia and Muscle.
When doctors want to measure the muscle health of a person’s hands and forearms, they may administer a grip strength test. 
This simple test uses a tool called a dynamometer. The person simply holds the dynamometer in their hand and squeezes it with all their strength, and the tool measures the amount of force used. 
Grip strength has long been considered a biomarker of a person’s overall health. Previous research has associated reduced grip strength with an increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. 
And past studies found grip strength to be an indicator of a person’s health-related quality of life as they age. 
The Timed Up and Go (TUG) test is used as a way for doctors to check a person’s mobility and balance. 
During the TUG test, a person is asked to sit in a normal chair. As a medical professional times them with a stopwatch, the person is asked to stand up, walk to a line about 10 feet away from the chair, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit back down in the chair. 
This allows the doctor to see how the person is walking and check their movement for postural or balance issues. 
The majority of healthy older adults can finish the TUG test in 10 seconds or less. A time of greater than 13.5 seconds may indicate a person is at a greater risk of falling. 
Previous studies have found the TUG test helps predict frailty in older adults, and evaluates their fall risk. 
According to Dr. Marc Sim, senior research fellow in the Nutrition & Health Innovation Research Institute at Edith Cowan University in Joondalup, Australia and lead author of this study, they decided to investigate a relationship between muscle function and dementia because current evidence suggests strong links between physical capacity, including muscle mass (e.g. sarcopenia) and cognitive health.
“When taken into the context of dementia, at a community level, the use of fast, inexpensive, and simple tests such as grip strength and TUG are extremely appealing,” he told Medical News Today. 
“This could serve as a screening tool to help clinicians identify those most at risk and enable the promotion of primary prevention strategies, (such as) exercise (and) nutrition. Screening for dementia risk at the community level is rarely performed,” he said. 
Dr. Sim said they selected grip strength and TUG tests as their methods to analyze study participants’ muscle function because they are both simple and easy to perform and are currently recommended as functional tests as part of sarcopenia criteria in Australia. 
“There is very strong evidence for these tests to predict a range of adverse outcomes in older populations — falls/ fracture/CVD/mortality — and take [around] 3 [minutes] to perform by clinicians,” he added. 
For this study, Dr. Sim and his team used data from the Perth Longitudinal Study of Ageing in Women to examine more than 1,000 women with an average age of 75.
Researchers administered grip strength and TUG tests to each woman. The tests were then repeated five years later. 
The scientists found over the next 15 years, about 17% of study participants either had a dementia event that was either a dementia-related hospitalization or death. 
Additionally, the research team found lower grip strength and slower TUG were significant risk factors for a study participant experiencing dementia. And the women with the weakest grip strength and slowest TUG tests were more than twice as likely to have a late-life dementia event. 
This was independent of other risk factors such as smoking, alcohol use, and physical activity levels. 
“Because these functional tests are likely to provide a snapshot of current health status, I would not say the results are surprising. Especially since we know that people who struggle with daily activities of living due to physical limitations are less likely to engage in exercise-a major risk factor for dementia,” Dr. Sim commented.
“What was of interest to me was the high dementia risk associated with declining function over five years, where those with the greatest decline were at the highest risk. This is also an important point for clinicians to consider,” he added.
After reviewing this study, Dr. Raphi Wald, a board-certified neuropsychologist at Marcus Neuroscience Institute, established at Boca Raton Regional Hospital part of Baptist Health South Florida, who was not involved in the study, told MNT that this study is helpful in confirming what we knew and strongly suspected about declining strength and cognitive functioning.
“There are a number of often subclinical signs and symptoms of dementia that pop up before serious deterioration begins. This is another hint for doctors that a process may be beginning and needs to be addressed,” he said. 
“I think it would be helpful to have more information about those patients that successfully address their muscle weakness and how much it decreases their risk for dementia once they do so,” Dr. Wald added when asked what he would like to see as next steps for this research.
Ryan Glatt, senior brain health coach and director of the FitBrain Program at Pacific Neuroscience Institute in Santa Monica, California, also not involved with this study, told MNT these findings are consistent with prior studies showing that grip strength and mobility are correlated with aspects of cognitive decline in older adults.
“Collecting mobility, gait, and strength data in clinical settings can be helpful in comprising a comprehensive set of data that could be helpful in predicting the risk of dementia. It would be interesting to correlate these mobility and strength measures with other aspects of brain health,” he added.
Medical News Today also spoke with Dr. William Buxton, a board-certified neurologist and director of Neuromuscular and Neurodiagnostic Medicine and of Fall Prevention at Pacific Neuroscience Institute at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, about this study.
“[This study] tells us that the extra few minutes to do some really basic simple testing in the office, even just routine visits, like the Time Up and Go test and testing grip strength, can give us good, scientifically grounded reason to encourage physical activity not only for cardiac benefit but also for cognitive fitness.”— Dr. William Buxton
 “And for those individuals to pay a little bit closer attention to watching for cognitive decline that we may be able to slow down as a result of paying that extra attention,” Dr. Buxton, who was also not involved in the study, added. 
Dr. Buxton said he would like to see a similar study done in men and also research to see if there’s an added benefit to exercising in groups. 
“We know that people who stay socially active also are less prone to develop and/or experience worsening of cognitive problems. So I’d be eager to see if group exercise that’s linked to social engagement would have added benefit above and beyond individual exercise,” he added.

ESCANABA, Mich. – An investigation is underway as a blastomycosis outbreak has impacted over 100 people in the Upper Peninsula.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is working with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) as they investigate a health hazard at Billerud Escanaba Mill.
The two organizations are investigating a blastomycosis outbreak among the workers at the Michigan paper mill. According to a press release from Public Health Delta & Menominee Counties, as of May 5, there have been a total of 115 cases. Of the 115, 14 have been hospitalized, and there has been one fatality.
The disease is a fungal infection associated with a fungus that grows in moist soil and decomposing wood and leaves. Health officials say the disease can become airborne when the soil or decomposing matter is disturbed. The CDC states blastomycosis is not contagious and doesn’t spread from person to person or animal to person. The PHDM says that Michigan’s Upper Peninsula is a known risk area for blastomycosis.
Billerud stated in a release that they first learned about the fungal infection on March 3 from the Public Health Delta & Menominee Counties (PHDM).
”Although the source of the infection has not been established, and we have not received any information from the mill’s investigation, public health officials, or any of the organizations assisting in this investigation, that indicates visiting or working at the mill is unsafe, we take this matter very seriously. We are following recommendations from experts at these organizations, including deep cleaning in high-traffic areas throughout the mill; inspecting ventilation systems and replacing filters, and testing various raw materials coming into the mill; conducting an onsite Health Hazard Evaluation to study the health and safety of Escanaba employees with the assistance of NIOSH, CDC, MDHHS, and PHDM; communicating regularly with employees, contractors, and visitors, encouraging them to wear NIOSH and OSHA-recommended N95 masks and recommending they contact their local healthcare providers if they are experiencing any symptoms. The temporary idling of the mill to perform additional cleaning is another proactive step we are taking,”
A NIOSH field team visited the paper mill in late March as they conducted an onsite evaluation. During the visit, the team held a meeting with management and employees to discuss the objective of the evaluation, they did a walkthrough of the 2,200-acre worksite to understand how the employees utilize their workspace, and they spoke with the company’s health physician and nurse to understand the source of exposure.
The CDC stated that NIOSH recommends that the company use N95s, inspect heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems, inspect the ductwork for water incision of microbial growth, limit the activities involving disrupting soil, and that any employees developing symptoms seek care.
“Our top priority now and always is protecting the health and safety of our employees and contractors who work at our Escanaba Mill,” stated Billerud President and CEO Christoph Michalski in a statement. “We care deeply about their well-being and are doing everything we can to protect them and identify and address the root cause of the blastomycosis fungal infections. As a precautionary measure, we will temporarily idle the Escanaba Mill for up to three weeks to facilitate additional proper cleaning based on recommendations from NIOSH and other organizations, which requires larger portions of the mill to be vacant while this work is performed. The financial impact is assessed to be limited since the production at the Escanaba Mill was being adjusted to meet current market demand.”

208,Barley water: 6 health benefits of this cool summer drink | HealthShots,https://www.healthshots.com/healthy-eating/nutrition/health-benefits-of-barley-water-in-summer/,"Barley water has been trending – and not for no reason! It is loved by many for its digestive, cooling and detoxifying properties. So sit back, relax, and let us introduce you to the benefits of drinking barley water and how to make it.
Barley water or jau ka pani is a refreshing and healthy drink made by boiling barley grains or jau in water until the liquid turns thick and creamy. It is rich in fiber, nutrients and antioxidants, making it an excellent tonic for the digestive system and a natural remedy for constipation. Barley water is also known for its cooling properties, which help to regulate body temperature and prevent heat-induced disorders during the summer months. Barley water is a versatile drink that offers numerous health benefits and can be easily incorporated into any diet.
“Barley water is an excellent digestive tonic for our gastrointestinal system. It regulates bowel habits and improves digestion due to its high fiber content,” says well-known nutritionist Dr Manoj Kutteri. He further explains that barley water has been used as a remedy for constipation due to its high fiber content.The dietary fiber present in barley makes it a gut-friendly drink. Regular consumption of barley water helps to improve peristalsis and regulate bowel movements, preventing strain during bowel movements due to dehydration.
The nutrition expert says that barley water helps to reduce the core body temperature during summer and prevent heat-induced disorders. By providing hydration to the body, barley water helps to maintain electrolyte balance and prevent dehydration.
Barley water also improves kidney functions and can be used to prevent or treat urinary tract infections or kidney stones. “Its diuretic properties flush out extra water from our system, providing excellent hydration to the body,” says Dr Kutteri. It is an excellent detox drink for the liver and a blood purifier. The antioxidant properties of barley water help to fight the free radicals in our body, thus preventing various diseases.
Barley water is an excellent weight loss agent. Barley helps to prevent the absorption of LDL and triglycerides, which can result in weight loss. Barley can be taken in the form of gruel or khichadi as well to manage weight and can be an excellent alternative grain option.

Dr Kutteri explains that since barley water helps to flush out extra water from our system, it can be used to maintain blood volume, thus helping with high blood pressure. It is a great option if your blood pressure is linked to compromised filtration from the kidney or too much salt intake.
The soluble fiber beta-glucan present in barley water binds with glucose molecules in our digestive tract and slows down the absorption of sugar. This helps to manage sugar spikes and treat diabetes. Its low Glycemic Index (GI) makes it a good healthy and diabetic-friendly grain substitute.

Dr Kutteri suggests that for making barley water, rinse the barley grains thoroughly and soak them in water overnight. The next day, boil the barley in water for around 30 minutes or until the water turns thick and creamy. Strain the mixture and add lime juice or mint for flavour. You can also add honey or jaggery for sweetness. The best time to consume barley water is early in the morning and on an empty stomach. This will help our body to stay cool and well hydrated.

209,Wolves: Want to lead your pack? Get a parasite! | Boing Boing,https://boingboing.net/2023/05/07/wolves-want-to-lead-your-pack-get-a-parasite.html,"A lot has been written about the toxoplasma gondii parasite.  You might have read that it's a protozoan parasite whose life cycle involves getting ingested by cats, reproducing inside cats, getting pooped out of cats, and starting all over again.
How does it get ingested by cats?  The theory is that rodents come in contact with the infected cat poop, and then the parasite infects and alters the rodents' brains to make them actually them less risk-averse generally, and less afraid of cats specifically.  That bold behavior increases the chance that a cat will catch and eat the rodent, starting the circle again. 
That's crazy enough.  But some have even theorized that when humans come in contact with the parasite, their brains can become infected and transformed in the same way intended for rodents, and they can become permanently less fearful and more aggressive.  
If you haven't heard of this, I recommend this mind-blowing Atlantic article that introduced this theory.
This parasite-induced behavioral change may be more common throughout the animal world than we knew.
A new study of wolves in Yellowstone National Park shows that some are infected with toxoplasma gondii, possibly because they share their range with cougars, and those that are have certain behavioral/personality traits, according to Connor Meyer, a field biologist at the University of Montana in Missoula.  From a Science News article:
""The team screened the wolf blood for antibodies against T. gondii parasites, which reveal an infection. The researchers also noted which wolves left their pack — usually a family unit consisting of a breeding pair and their offspring — or became a pack leader. 
""Both are high-stakes moves for a wolf, Meyer says. 
""Infected wolves were 11 times as likely as noninfected wolves to disperse from their pack, the team found, and about 46 times as likely to eventually become leaders. The findings fit in with T. gondii's apparent ability to boost boldness across a wide range of warm-blooded life.""
Study co-author Kira Cassidy is not convinced that the high-risk behaviors caused by the parasite are necessarily advantageous, and believes that more study is needed.  There may be some survival-bias in the study because we're only studying the wolves who survived the infection, and who survived the aggressive, risky behaviors that it may have caused.
Grey wolves in America's Yellowstone National Park exposed to Toxoplasma gondii are over 46 times more likely to become a pack leader than uninfected wolves, according to a study published in @CommsBio. https://t.co/n5mbdK89BM pic.twitter.com/lRblAkZyGh

210,25-Year-Old US Woman Who Couldn't Stop Burping Diagnosed With Stage 3 Cancer,https://www.ndtv.com/feature/25-year-old-us-woman-who-couldnt-stop-burping-diagnosed-with-stage-3-cancer-4013281,"Bailey McBreen started burping frequently - up to 10 times a day - in 2021.
A 25-year-old woman in the United States who couldn't stop burping has revealed her symptom was caused by undiagnosed, late-stage cancer. 
According to People, Bailey McBreen from Florida started burping frequently - up to 10 times a day - in 2021. She put the symptom off for months, but she got checked when it progressed to acid reflux and ""excruciating"" stomach cramps. Ms McBreen revealed that she was eventually diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer, which came as a ""huge shock"" to her and her family. 
""The first sign something was wrong - although I didn't know it at the time - was when I began excessively burping,"" Ms McBreen told NeedToKnow. ""I would burp 5-10 times a day. This was not normal for me,"" she added. 
Ms McBreen explained that her health started deteriorating and she started dealing with ""excruciating"" pain, a loss of appetite and an inability to go to the bathroom. As a nurse, she then trusted her instincts that she had some sort of ""obstruction"" and immediately went to the hospital. Later, a CT scan revealed that she had stage 3 colon cancer and a tumour obstructing her large intestine.

""I never thought it could be linked to such a horrible disease,"" she said. ""It truly was an out-of-body experience,"" the 25-year-old added of her diagnosis. ""I remember the first thing I could say was, 'I am not ready to die.' Never in a million years did I think that any vague symptom I had was actually stage 3 colon cancer,"" she said. 
Further, Ms McBreen told NeedToKnow.co.uk that she believes the nonstop burping was linked to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which began a month after noticing the burping.
""Excessive burping isn't your textbook sign of colon cancer - but my oncologist told me that it was likely the start of my symptoms,"" she said. ""GERD was a symptom in my case because my tumor was slowly causing a complete bowel obstruction,"" she added.
According to People, following her diagnosis, Ms McBreen had emergency surgery to remove the tumour. She is currently undergoing chemotherapy until the end of August. 
She is now encouraging others to listen to their bodies if something feels off. Notably, colon cancer is the third most common cancer in the world, after lung and breast cancers.

212,Dreaming Away Dementia: Berkeley Research Shows Deep Sleep Alleviates Alzheimer’s Memory Loss,https://scitechdaily.com/dreaming-away-dementia-berkeley-research-shows-deep-sleep-alleviates-alzheimers-memory-loss/,"
By University of California - Berkeley
May 7, 2023

UC Berkeley sleep scientists have found that deep sleep, also known as non-REM slow-wave sleep, may protect against memory decline in older adults with high amounts of Alzheimer’s disease pathology. Disrupted sleep has been associated with a faster accumulation of beta-amyloid protein in the brain, which is linked to memory loss caused by dementia. However, this new research suggests that higher levels of deep sleep can act as a cognitive reserve factor, increasing resilience against the effects of beta-amyloid protein. By practicing good sleep hygiene, older adults may be able to benefit from this compensatory function against Alzheimer’s pathology.
 University of California, Berkeley sleep scientists say that deep sleep might help alleviate some of dementia’s most devastating outcomes.
Deep sleep may help protect against memory decline in older adults with high Alzheimer’s disease pathology, acting as a cognitive reserve factor against beta-amyloid protein effects. Good sleep hygiene can offer benefits against Alzheimer’s pathology.
A deep slumber might help buffer against memory loss for older adults facing a heightened burden of Alzheimer’s disease, new research from the University of California, Berkeley, suggests.
Deep sleep, also known as non-REM slow-wave sleep, can act as a “cognitive reserve factor” that may increase resilience against a protein in the brain called beta-amyloid that is linked to memory loss caused by dementia. Disrupted sleep has previously been associated with faster accumulation of beta-amyloid protein in the brain. However, the new research from a team at UC Berkeley reveals that superior amounts of deep, slow-wave sleep can act as a protective factor against memory decline in those with existing high amounts of Alzheimer’s disease pathology — a potentially significant advance that experts say could help alleviate some of dementia’s most devastating outcomes.
“With a certain level of brain pathology, you’re not destined for cognitive symptoms or memory issues,” said Zsófia Zavecz, a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley’s Center for Human Sleep Science. “People should be aware that, despite having a certain level of pathology, there are certain lifestyle factors that will help moderate and decrease the effects.
“One of those factors is sleep and, specifically, deep sleep.”
The research, published on May 3, 2023, in the journal BMC Medicine, is the latest in a large body of work aimed at finding a cure for Alzheimer’s disease and preventing it altogether.
As the most prevalent form of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease destroys memory pathways and, in advanced forms, interferes with a person’s ability to perform basic daily tasks. Roughly one in nine people over age 65 have the progressive disease — a proportion that is expected to grow rapidly as the baby boomer generation ages.

In recent years, scientists have probed the ways that deposits of beta-amyloid associate with Alzheimer’s disease and how such deposits also affect memory more generally. In addition to sleep being a foundational part of memory retention, the team at UC Berkeley previously discovered that the declining amount of a person’s deep sleep could act as a “crystal ball” to forecast a faster rate of future beta-amyloid buildup in the brain, after which dementia is more likely set in.
Years of education, physical activity, and social engagement are widely believed to shore up a person’s resilience to severe brain pathology — essentially keeping the mind sharp, despite the decreased brain health. These are called cognitive reserve factors. However, most of them, such as past years of education or the size of one’s social network, cannot be easily changed or modified retroactively.
That idea of cognitive reserve became a compelling target for sleep researchers, said Matthew Walker, a UC Berkeley professor of neuroscience and psychology and senior author of the study.
“If we believe that sleep is so critical for memory,” Walker said, “could sleep be one of those missing pieces in the explanatory puzzle that would tell us exactly why two people with the same amounts of vicious, severe amyloid pathology have very different memory?”
“If the findings supported the hypothesis, it would be thrilling, because sleep is something we can change,” he added. “It is a modifiable factor.”
To test that question, the researchers recruited 62 older adults from the Berkeley Aging Cohort Study. Participants, who were healthy adults and not diagnosed with dementia, slept in a lab while researchers monitored their sleep waves with an electroencephalography (EEG) machine. Researchers also used a positron emission tomography (PET) scan to measure the amount of beta-amyloid deposits in the participants’ brains. Half of the participants had high amounts of amyloid deposits; the other half did not.
After they slept, the participants completed a memory task involving matching names to faces.
Those with high amounts of beta-amyloid deposits in their brain who also experienced higher levels of deep sleep performed better on the memory test than those with the same amount of deposits but who slept worse. This compensatory boost was limited to the group with amyloid deposits. In the group without pathology, deep sleep had no additional supportive effect on memory, which was understandable as there was no demand for resilience factors in otherwise intact cognitive function.
In other words, deep sleep bent the arrow of cognition upward, blunting the otherwise detrimental effects of beta-amyloid pathology on memory.
In their analysis, the researchers went on to control for other cognitive reserve factors, including education and physical activity, and still sleep demonstrated a marked benefit. This suggests that sleep, independent of these other factors, contributes to salvaging memory function in the face of brain pathology. These new discoveries, they said, indicate the importance of non-REM slow-wave sleep in counteracting some of the memory-impairing effects of beta-amyloid deposits.
Walker likened deep sleep to a rescue effort.
“Think of deep sleep almost like a life raft that keeps memory afloat, rather than memory getting dragged down by the weight of Alzheimer’s disease pathology,” Walker said. “It now seems that deep NREM sleep may be a new, missing piece in the explanatory puzzle of cognitive reserve. This is especially exciting because we can do something about it. There are ways we can improve sleep, even in older adults.”
Chief among those areas for improvement? Stick to a regular sleep schedule, stay mentally and physically active during the day, create a cool and dark sleep environment and minimize things like coffee late in the day and screen time before bed. A warm shower before turning in for the night has also been shown to increase the quality of deep, slow-wave sleep, Zavecz said.
With a small sample size of healthy participants, the study is simply an early step in understanding the precise ways sleep may forestall memory loss and the advance of Alzheimer’s, Zavecz said.
Still, it opens the door for potential longer-term experiments examining sleep-enhancement treatments that could have far-reaching implications.
“One of the advantages of this result is the application to a huge population right above the age of 65,” Zavecz said. “By sleeping better and doing your best to practice good sleep hygiene, which is easy to research online, you can gain the benefit of this compensatory function against this type of Alzheimer’s pathology.”

Sadly despite my ongoing efforts, with the Internet being the best problem solving method ever devised by humanity, my personal senior lay findings of undiagnosed Dr. Arthur F. Coca’s (my) kind of food (minimally) allergy reactions aggravated (or not) with officially (FDA in the US) approved food poisoning (namely added ‘cultured-free’ [can cross the blood/brain barrier] MSG) and/or related/resultant medical errors being the underlying causes of so many epidemics of chronic diseases are just not getting-out to either the general public or healthcare professionals.
Insomnia is just one symptom and Alzheimer’s Disease (like depression and obesity, minimally) are others. The underlying mechanism in all cases appears to me to be a high blood serum level of uric acid, causing a very gradual generally undiagnosed calcium deficiency (especially older mothers) and acidic blood eventually eroding cholesterol from the myelin sheaths of brain and nerve cells, with the body filling-in the voids with that which is available. Ineligible for any large research grants, myself, it’s up to others to prove or disprove those. I’m just a 79 year old living example and no amount of meta-analysis of fatally flawed so-called “evidence-based’ medicine will reveal what I’ve uniquely learned on my own.

214,Why do coughs linger after a cold? | Live Science,https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/why-do-coughs-linger-after-a-cold,"When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.
Coughing is helpful during sickness to protect the lungs from infection. But lasting inflammation may irritate the nerve reflexes that cause coughing.
Colds and other respiratory illnesses are never fun. After the sneezing, sniffles and runny nose fade, one symptom often remains: coughing. But why do coughs sometimes take forever to go away? 
The main reason coughs are long-lasting is due to lingering inflammation, said Dr. Albert Rizzo (opens in new tab), chief medical officer at the American Lung Association. This inflammation can have several sources, making it difficult to treat. 
These sources can include viral and bacterial infections that cause airway and nasal inflammation. This inflammation irritates the mucous membranes in the airway and nose and produces mucus — the phlegm and snot associated with colds. Nasal inflammation leads to postnasal drip, which is mucus that drips down the throat from the nose and is a common cause of coughing, according to the National Institutes of Health (opens in new tab). 
When particles enter the airway through the nose or mouth they can trigger nerve receptors in the lungs to tell the brain, ""That's not what we want down here,"" Rizzo said. Pressure then builds up in the diaphragm, and air is forcefully expelled, taking dust, food and mucus out with it. 
In addition to nasal inflammation, coughs linger after colds because airway inflammation may take a few weeks to subside, and this time could be extended if someone has had previous lung infections or is a smoker, Rizzo said. 
Related: Should you exercise if you're sick? 
When someone is sick, special immune cells called macrophages (opens in new tab) and neutrophils (opens in new tab) help fight infections in the airway. These cells are also inflammatory. Sometimes after a cold ends, these cells remain in the airway and keep it inflamed, which is why coughing can continue after infection, said Dr. Amy Dickey (opens in new tab), a pulmonary and clinical care doctor at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and an instructor of medicine at MGH and Harvard Medical School. 
In the meantime, delicate airway tissues can be extra sensitive to particles that enter through the nose or mouth. That’s because there's a complex system of nerves and muscles in the airway, throat and brain that control coughing. ""Like if you [use a] reflex hammer on your knee, your leg kicks out. There can be similar types of reflexes in the airway,"" said Dickey. In other words, viruses and mucus are the reflex hammer and coughing is the kicking leg. Once inflammation goes down, this reflex becomes less sensitive and a cough should disappear.

For coughs that last three to four weeks after sickness there are a few home remedies and behaviors that can help shorten a cough's stay (or at least relieve symptoms). 
If postnasal drip accompanies a cough, nasal saline or nasal steroids can help reduce the inflammation contributing to the drip, Dickey said. These are often available over the counter. Throat lozenges can also help calm the larynx and suppress coughs, she added.
According to a 2021 study published in the International Journal of Cardiopulmonary Medicine and Rehabilitation (opens in new tab), research shows that honey and saline can help relieve coughing. However, more studies are needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of natural products.  
While coughing can be nagging, it's crucial to remember that coughing serves an immune function. If irritants and mucus stay in the airways, they can damage the delicate airway tissues or the lungs, or even obstruct breathing. Dickey recommends exercising to stimulate deep breathing to loosen mucus (opens in new tab), or taking expectorants that thin mucus and make it easier to cough up. This can help remove those inflammatory irritants.
—Does drinking milk make your body produce more mucus?
—Why does cold fresh air help nausea go away?
—Why don't we breathe equally out of both nostrils?
While it's good to be considerate of other people, said Dickey, sometimes it’s important to let coughs out.   
While a lingering cough is most commonly caused by irritation from inflammation, people should see a doctor if a cough lasts more than three to four weeks and is accompanied by other symptoms (opens in new tab) like fever, shortness of breath or green and yellow mucus.
If a cough continues on its own for more than eight weeks, a doctor may want to do a chest X-ray or measure lung function to check for COPD, lung cancer, emphysema or other serious diseases, Rizzo said.

215,How agriculture gave us crooked teeth - Upworthy,https://www.upworthy.com/why-early-humans-had-straight-teeth,"Thanks, innovation! 
Technology isn't everything.
Crooked teeth is a very, very common occurrence in our modern world. Nine out of ten people have at least some misalignment going on in their mouths. Over 4 million people wear braces in the United States alone. I don’t know about you, but I can still feel the utter sticker shock from my own teeth-straightening journey. (I call it a “journey” so it feels a little more whimsical and less devastating.)
And yet, this is not something our ancestors dealt with. Like…at all. How could it be that no one experienced this normal modern-day conundrum in a time when we had exponentially less technological advancement?
The prevailing theory in the scientific community is that millions of years ago, when humans were hunter-gatherers, their teeth had to work extra hard to grind down seeds, fruit, meat, etc., and make them digestible.When humans began incorporating tools, food was broken down before it even entered the mouth. It only became more refined and easier to chew with the introduction of agriculture, followed by the innovations of the Industrial Revolution.In a relatively short amount of time (12,000 years), teeth were basically relieved of most of their “pulverizing duties.” And while teeth were initially able to adapt to the gradual evolution of culinary changes, things simply changed too quickly to keep up. Over time, jaws have reduced in size much more quickly than our teeth have, leading to overcrowding and some…unique dental arrangements. This also helps explain why wisdom teeth are such a pain. By the time these final molars come out, there is simply no room left in the mouth for them. This is why many people need them surgically removed in order to prevent discomfort or infection.This theory has been tested on animals like spider monkeys and lyraxes, who were given naturally tough foods and artificially softened foods. Sure enough, the critters with the softer foods also developed narrower jaws, and more crooked teeth.Bottom line: this issue has a lot more to do with lifestyle than anything genetic. Which is why different people in different parts of the world don’t deal with dental crowding at all, and even have room for wisdom teeth. Knowing this might not stop us from eating softer foods—it’s certainly not gonna make me give up warm gooey cookies any time soon, perfect smile and zero cavities be damned—but it’s certainly something to chew on.You can watch the full video, based on a lesson by dental anthropologist G. Richard Scott, below:

What will you create on your social media break? Share it at #MyVisionMySight.
If you’ve always lived in a world with social media, it can be tough to truly understand how it affects your life. One of the best ways to grasp its impact is to take a break to see what life is like without being tethered to your phone and distracted by a constant stream of notifications.
Knowing when to disconnect is becoming increasingly important as younger people are becoming aware of the adverse effects screen time can have on their eyes. According to Eyesafe Nielsen, adults are now spending 13-plus hours a day on their digital devices, a 35% increase from 2019.1. Many of us now spend more time staring at screens on a given day than we do sleeping which can impact our eye health.

Normally, you blink around 15 times per minute, however, focusing your eyes on computer screens or other digital displays have been shown to reduce your blink rate by up to 60%.2 Reduced blinking can destabilize your eyes’ tear film, causing dry, tired eyes and blurred vision.3














 We ""modern"" folks don't even have all of these luxuries.
Can we bring back some 50s fridge features, please? 
There are very few things that would make people nostalgic for the 1950s. Sure, they had cool cars and pearl necklaces were a staple, but that time frame had its fair share of problems, even if ""Grease"" made it look dreamy. Whether you believe your life would've been way more interesting if you were Danny Zuko or not, most would agree their technology was...lacking.
All eras are ""advanced"" for their time, but imagine being dropped off in the 50s as someone from the year 2023. A recent post by Historic Vids on Twitter of a 1956 commercial advertising a refrigerator, however, has some people thinking that when it came to fridges, maybe they were living in the year 2056. I don't typically swoon over appliances, yet this one has me wondering where I can purchase a refrigerator like this. 
Of course, there's no fancy touch screen that tells you the weather and asks how you'd like your ice cubed. It's got more important features that are actually practical. 






Why did kids just stop walking to school?
Two kids wearing backpacks walk to school together.
Over the past 40 years, a sea change has occurred in how kids get to school. Throughout most Western countries, an increasing number of children are driven to school instead of walking or taking a bike. In a new video called “Why did kids stop walking to school?” About Here’s founder, Uytae Lee, cites the U.S. Department of Transportation statistic that in 1969, 48% of kids walked or biked to school, and that number has plummeted to just 11%.
Uytae Lee is an urban planner and videographer passionate about sharing stories about our cities. The video was produced in partnership with TransLink, Metro Vancouver's regional transportation authority.



Several claimed the episode perpetuated harmful messages about exercise and body weight. 
Bandit, Bluey's dad, laments his weight and says he needs to exercise. 
The Australian kids' cartoon “Bluey” is pretty universally loved by young and old audiences alike. People appreciate the show’s unique way of blending wholesome humor with mundane or even difficult situations in a way that feels both mature and whimsical. 
On a recent “Bluey” episode titled “Exercise,”  Bluey’s father, Bandit, becomes disappointed after stepping on the bathroom scale, grabbing his tummy and declaring he needs to start exercising. 
""Oh man...I just need to do some exercise,"" Bandit laments.
""Tell me about it,"" Bluey's mother, Chilli, chimes in before stepping on the scale herself and shares a similar reaction to her own numbers. 
















The success of this surgery could mean many more to come. 
The innovative procedure is performed in utero and guided by ultrasound.
Fetal surgery is undoubtedly a complicated and delicate procedure, with both physical and ethical implications. It’s rarely even an option for treatment, only being done for a select number of conditions and only for pregnant women who meet certain criteria. 
And still, doctors at two Boston hospitals stepped forward to repair a malformed blood vessel in a baby girl’s brain two days before she was born, succeeding in the first ever surgery of its kind.




The Earth, Wind & Fire ""September"" parody is a hit with harried parents.
""Maycember""—busy like December but without the fun holidays.
For parents of school-aged kids, May is absolute mayhem and there are very few ways around it.

216,"Petermann Glacier in Greenland is melting away with the tide, which could signal faster sea level rise, study finds | CNN",https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/08/us/greenland-petermann-glacier-melting-climate/index.html,"
      A major glacier in northwest Greenland is interacting with the ocean tides, scientists reported Monday, resulting in previously unaccounted-for melting and potentially faster sea level rise. 
  

      The group of glaciologists from the University of California, Irvine and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory published the study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday.
  

      Observations from the Petermann Glacier revealed that the glacier’s grounding line — the area where the ice sheet begins to extend out on top of the ocean — can shift significantly as tides come in and out each day.
  

      Petermann’s grounding line “migrates between 2 and 6 kilometers (1.2 to 3.7 miles) as tides come in and out,” according to Enrico Ciracì, the lead author of the study and a scientist at UCI.
  

Ocean temperatures are off the charts right now, and scientists are alarmed


      This is an important finding: The traditional view among scientists was that the grounding line did not migrate with the tides – and this introduces another major source of melting that could be accelerating sea level rise.
  

      Between 2016 and 2022, warmer tidal cycles melted a 670-foot-tall hole in the underside of the glacier along the grounding line — big enough that two Statues of Liberty could be stacked on top of one another inside it. 
  

      The phenomenon could worsen in the coming years and decades as ocean temperatures climb. CNN recently reported that sea surface temperatures were at their highest on record this spring — a spike that has alarmed scientists who are concerned it could be part of a worrying new trend.
  

      The study raises more concerns for the already worrisome prospect of sea level rise, which threatens coastlines around the world. Greenland’s melting ice is the single largest contributor to sea level rise, according to NASA, which has been accelerating in recent years. But current projections do not account for this newfound contribution from under-ice interactions with warming tides.
  

      “These ice-ocean interactions make the glaciers more sensitive to ocean warming,” said co-author Eric Rignot, a professor at UCI and NASA JPL research scientist, in a statement. “These dynamics are not included in models, and if we were to include them, it would increase projections of sea level rise by up to 200 percent – not just for Petermann but for all glaciers ending in the ocean, which is most of northern Greenland and all of Antarctica.”

217,JWST captures images of the first asteroid belts seen beyond the Solar System | Engadget,https://www.engadget.com/jwst-captures-images-of-the-first-asteroid-belts-seen-beyond-the-solar-system-192847989.html,"About 25 light years away from Earth lies Fomalhaut, one of the brightest stars in the night sky. The Fomalhaut system has captivated astronomers for decades, but it’s only now that we’re developing a better understanding of it thanks to the James Webb Space Telescope. In a study published in the journal Nature Astronomy on Monday, a group of scientists made up primarily of astronomers from the University of Arizona and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory say the Fomalhaut system is far more complex than previously thought.
Since 1983, astronomers have known the 440 million-year-old Fomalhaut is surrounded by dust and debris, but what they didn’t expect to find was three different debris fields surrounding the star. One of those, the closest to Fomalhaut, is similar to our solar system’s asteroid belt but far more expansive than expected. As the New Scientist explains, Fomalhaut’s inner asteroid belt stretches from about seven astronomical units from the star to about 80 astronomical units out. To put those numbers in perspective, that’s about 10 times broader of an inner asteroid belt than astronomers expected to find.
However, that’s not even the most interesting feature of the Fomalhaut system. Outside of Fomalhaut’s inner asteroid belt, there is a second debris belt that is tilted at 23 degrees from everything else in orbit of the star. “This is a truly unique aspect of the system,”  András Gáspár, lead author on the study, told Science News. He added that the tilted belt could be the result of planets in orbit of Fomalhaut astronomers haven’t discovered yet.
“The belts around Fomalhaut are kind of a mystery novel: Where are the planets?” said George Rieke, one of the astronomers involved in the study. ""I think it's not a very big leap to say there's probably a really interesting planetary system around the star.”
Yet out further out from Fomalhaut is an outer debris ring similar to our solar system’s Kuiper belt. It includes a feature Gáspár and his colleagues have named the Great Dust Cloud. It’s unclear if this feature is part of the Fomalhaut system or something shining from beyond it, but they suspect it was formed when two space rocks more than 400 miles wide collided with one another.  According to Gáspár and company, there may be three or more planets about the size of Uranus and Neptune orbiting Fomalhaut. They’re now analyzing JWST images that may reveal the existence of those planetoids.",1
218,Frogs in Puerto Rico croak at a higher pitch due to global heating | Amphibians | The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/08/coqui-frog-puerto-rico-croak-higher-pitch-global-heating,"Call of the coquí frog is affected by rising temperatures, scientists find
Frogs in Puerto Rico are croaking at a higher pitch due to global heating, scientists have found.
The frogs appear to be decreasing in size at warmer temperatures, which causes their croaks to become high pitched. If the trends continue, the heat could become too much for the sensitive amphibians to survive successfully, researchers have said.
The call of the coquí frog is well known to most who have spent time in Puerto Rico. It is named for its two-note call “co-qui”, which rings out throughout the island every night.
Male coquí frogs use their distinctive call to mark their territory and warn off rivals, but scientists have noticed that it is changing.
Peter Narins of the University of California, Los Angeles, has been studying their croaks for 23 years. While recording the sounds along the slopes of El Yunque mountain in Puerto Rico, he and his team found that the calls changed depending on the altitude of the frogs.
Amphibians are very sensitive to changes in temperature, and the higher on the mountains they were, the cooler it was. The frogs on the mountain peaks, therefore, were found to be larger than ones sitting in warm valleys, and this meant their call was different.
Nairns said: “Coquí that produced short, high-pitched calls at high rates lived near the base of the mountain, while the calls of animals living near the mountain’s peak were longer, lower-pitched, and repeated less frequently.”
Two decades after first recording their sound, Nairns returned to the mountains with a colleague, Sebastiaan Meenderink. The pair found that every frog call, no matter where it was on the mountain, had become higher pitched.
“In order to record a call with certain characteristics we had to move to a slightly higher altitude,” said Meenderink. “It was as if all the animals had moved up the mountain.”

The scientists are concerned that the frogs will keep crawling up the mountain to escape higher temperatures at the bottom, but they will eventually run out of room.
“For now, the consequences are not dire,” said Meenderink. “A barely perceptible change in frog body size and call has little impact on the environment. However, if left unabated, the temperature increase will eventually cause a collapse of the coquí population, which will be catastrophic for the Puerto Rican ecosystem.”",1
220,‘Tall Nose’ Gene in Humans Was Inherited From Neanderthals,https://gizmodo.com/tall-nose-gene-neanderthals-interbreeding-humans-1850414951,"Researchers have identified a gene that is associated with taller noses in humans and found it likely comes from Neanderthals, an extinct hominin group intimately related to our own species.
Neanderthals (Homo neanderthalensis) died off around 40,000 years ago, making them the most recent hominin species to go extinct. But, in a way, they are still around, since most humans today are walking around with Neanderthal DNA. Lots of interbreeding between Homo sapiens and Neanderthals may have resulted in their species being subsumed by ours.
Long stereotyped as brutish oafs, Neanderthals were actually highly sociable and intelligent. Physically speaking, they were shorter than modern humans, with barrel chests and pronounced brows. They also had broad, tall nasal passages, which the researchers believe has resulted in the nose shape of many people today.
In their new research, published today in Communications Biology, the interdisciplinary team studied genetic information from 6,000 modern humans of mixed European, Native American, and African ancestry from Latin America. They then cross-referenced the genetic findings with  measurements of the individuals’ facial features, especially of their noses. 
A perfect treeThis magical little tree is a lot of fun to build, has a few customizable parts, and never needs watering to keep it alive. You can water it if you want, but it’s not necessary. 
“Most genetic studies of human diversity have investigated the genes of Europeans; our study’s diverse sample of Latin American participants broadens the reach of genetic study findings, helping us to better understand the genetics of all humans,” said study co-author Andres Ruiz-Linares, a geneticist at Fudan University, University College London, and Aix-Marseille University, in a UCL release.
The gene the team deemed responsible for tall noses in some humans is the Activating Transcription Factor 3 (ATF3). The gene is not known to be involved directly with the development of the human face. However, the researchers note that, back in 2007, a different team found expression of ATF3 is regulated by another transcription factor, FOXL2, mutations of which “are known to lead to alterations of the midface.”
Beyond that association, they found that little bits of genetic code known as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that appear around ATF3 were found around elements of DNA that are active during the development of the head and face. 
The Neanderthal genome was sequenced over a decade ago, allowing scientists to better understand our ancient near-relations and, by proxy, what makes us human. (A lot of that work was spearheaded by Svante Pääbo, who last year was recognized with a Nobel Prize for his contributions to paleogenetics.)
While ATF3 is not itself a smoking gun for Neanderthal honkers nosing their way into our genome, the odds and ends within the gene suggest a link.
“It has long been speculated that the shape of our noses is determined by natural selection; as our noses can help us to regulate the temperature and humidity of the air we breathe in, different shaped noses may be better suited to different climates that our ancestors lived in,” said Qing Li, a geneticist at Fudan University and lead author of the study, in the same release. 
“The gene we have identified here may have been inherited from Neanderthals to help humans adapt to colder climates as our ancestors moved out of Africa,” Li Added.
Among Neanderthals’ physiological characteristics was a broad, tall nose with wide nostrils. As reported in 2018 in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, one theory is that the Neanderthal nose size was helpful for breathing deeply in cold, dry climates.
Whether to take in extra air or to warm and humidify the air before it reached their lungs, the Neanderthal body was built for endurance. Neanderthals in Italy dove for shellfish; maybe their large noses helped the groups in Mediterranean climes take a deep breath before going underwater. 
40,000 years later, remnants of our lost relatives live on in our modern gene pool.

NASA is set to launch a human mission to Mars in the 2030s and a new study suggests it should be an all-female crew because they are more efficient.
Researchers from the European Space Agency (ESA) found women use less oxygen, produce less carbon dioxide and require less food than their male counterparts.
The team simulated a 1080-day mission with four women astronauts and found they needed 3,736 pounds less food, saving more than $158 million.
Because Mars is about a seven-month journey from Earth, the study urges space agencies to consider the findings to reduce the mass and volume of food that must be launched and stored with the crew.

Men and women, however, are both vital in space and will be necessary for when humanity colonizes the Red Planet. 
Approximately 622 people have launched into space, but only 72 are women.
NASA has sent a total of 355 people to space so far, of which some 55 have been women — or 15 percent. It has also sent 24 people to orbit the moon and 12 to walk on the lunar surface, who were all men. 
Russian Valentina Tereshkova was the first woman to ever leave the earth's atmosphere — setting off in 1937. 
And it was not until 1983, when Sally Ride launched to the International Space Station, did American women first visit the final frontier.
However, NASA is determined to put the first female astronaut on the moon in two years and will likely include women on the trip to Mars.
The new research suggests that NASA and other space agencies need to focus on all-female astronaut crews when it comes to long space missions.
The simulated 1080-day mission of the all-female crew shows because of their smaller stature, the group would free up eight cubic feet of space in the capsule.

NASA astronaut Christina Koch was recently named the first woman to visit the moon when NASA's Artemis II mission takes off next year
This is about four percent of a 'Gateway' HALO module in NASA's proposed lunar orbit space station. 
Scientists with the ESA analyzed oxygen consumption, total energy expenditure, carbon dioxide, heat production and water requirements of males and females on more extended spaceflight missions to see what the optimal astronaut would look like.

The avid surfer, rock climber and sailor was selected to become an astronaut in 2013.
Male astronauts had a total energy expenditure rising by 30 percent, oxygen consumption rising by 60 percent, carbon dioxide production rising by 60 percent, and water requirements increasing by 17 percent.
Female astronauts had much better metrics across the board as their body size increased, with the most impacted figures equating to a 30 percent reduction. 
NASA scientist Geoffrey Landis has long thought females are more fit for space.
In 2000, he said: 'Women are on average smaller than males: women use less oxygen, consume less consumables, produce less carbon dioxide. 
'They have lower mass and take up less volume. The argument for an all-female crew is simple: such a crew would require considerably less support… and allow a smaller spacecraft. 
'This would produce a considerable savings in cost.'
NASA astronaut Christina Koch was recently named the first woman to visit the moon when NASA's Artemis II mission takes off next year.
The Grand Rapids, Michigan native, 44, is already the record-holder for the longest amount of time a woman has spent in space, 328 days, and for taking part in the first all-female spacewalk in 2019.
The Artemis II mission marks NASA's first trip to the moon in half a century, which is really a test for NASA's ultimate goal of sending humans to Mars.
The agency sent an empty Orion capsule around the moon last year before it returned to Earth in a long-awaited dress rehearsal.
If this latest mission goes well, then another flight to land people on the moon will be sent in 2025 — as part of tests ahead of getting people onto Mars.

“When the Heavens Went on Sale: The Misfits and Geniuses Racing to Put Space Within Reach,” by Ashlee Vance (Ecco)
During the space race of the 1960s that was chronicled by Tom Wolfe in “The Right Stuff,” the era was personified by larger-than-life heroes like John Glenn, Gus Grissom and Alan Shepard.
In “When the Heavens Went on Sale: The Misfits and Geniuses Racing to Put Space Within Reach,” Ashlee Vance writes about a new kind of space race marked by private companies launching rockets and putting a massive number of satellites into orbit. The characters behind this new fight to dominate the skies are just as interesting as the ones Wolfe wrote about decades ago.
Vance, the author of a biography of SpaceX founder Elon Musk and a writer at Bloomberg Businessweek, is well-positioned to tell the story of the modern fight for the skies. He follows four companies — Astra, Firefly, Planet Labs and Rocket Lab — as they're vying against each other.
Vance's behind-the-scenes access to the companies helps explain the challenges the private space industry faces and propels the book along as he describes failed rocket launches and globe-trotting investors.
Musk and SpaceX play a minor role in the book, but Vance makes clear from the outset he's writing about a new frontier that was opened up by the launch of SpaceX's Falcon 1 rocket in 2008. That launch, Vance writes, was an “inciting incident” that created the modern space frenzy by investors and private businesses.
Vance's reporting and clear writing help illustrate just how much of a frenzy it has become, with the number of satellites doubling over a two-year period to 5,000 in 2022 and that number expected to grow to possibly 100,000 over the next decade. That growth, Vance notes, has created a new opportunity for businesses who help ensure those satellites don't collide.
The book leaves some unanswered questions about the implications of that explosive growth for both space and the businesses trying to cash in on it. But that's mainly because that's a chapter that's still being written by the new space race itself.",1

Because of their wing buds, these members of the clonal raider ant species resemble queens, but they are instead “inquiline” social parasites. They lay eggs that workers in the colony care for like their own offspring.
Daniel Kronauer
Contributing Writer
May 8, 2023
When the researcher Daniel Kronauer was still a postdoc in 2008, he traveled to Okinawa, Japan, for wild specimens of clonal raider ants (the species Ooceraea biroi). In the first colony he collected, he noticed two ants with a strange appearance. They were small like workers, but they also sported small wing buds, which was striking because usually only ant queens develop wings. What made this even stranger was that clonal raider ants don’t even have queens: In keeping with their name, these ants reproduce asexually, so all the ants in a colony are nearly perfect genetic clones.
Kronauer was intrigued by the miniature queens because they seemed so different from the other clonal raider ants even though he believed them to be the same species. But answers to his questions weren’t forthcoming, so he took some specimens, shot some photos for records and then moved on with his work.
A few years later, Kronauer established a lab at Rockefeller University and set up a colony of clonal raider ants for study. One day, his then-doctoral student Buck Trible found a few more of the odd miniature queens in that colony and decided to characterize them.
Trible found that the wings weren’t the ants’ only unusual characteristic. The strange ants also showed different social behaviors, had larger ovaries and laid twice as many eggs. Using genetic tools, he traced all of these changes to a 2.25-million-base-pair-long stretch of DNA. In the ordinary ants, the DNA on each of the two copies of their chromosome 13 was different. But in the miniature-queen ants, the two copies were identical.

A mutant “inquiline” social parasite (at bottom) is roughly the size of a worker (at top) in a clonal raider ant colony. However, the inquiline’s wing buds and its ability to lay more eggs are more typical of the queens of other ant species.
Daniel Kronauer
As Trible, Kronauer and their colleagues reported in March in Current Biology, all of the characteristics of the odd ants — the wings, the social behaviors and the reproductive traits — were caused by what geneticists call a supergene, a collection of genes that are inherited as a unit and are highly resistant to being broken up. At some point in their evolution, the ants had acquired a second copy of that supergene, and that chromosomal change had transformed their bodies and behaviors. The findings suggested a new mechanism for how complex combinations of body parts and behaviors can sometimes surface all at once in evolution: through a mutation that duplicates a supergene, toggling on entire suites of traits like strings of lights controlled by a light switch.
Ant researchers are excited by the work, and not just because it seems to solve a decades-old mystery about how at least one form of social parasitism evolves in the insects. The supergene discoveries may also help them pin down long-sought features in ants’ genetic architecture that make their colonies develop as hierarchical castes of queens and workers.
More broadly, the new study also offers insights into a fundamental evolutionary question about how different the individuals in a single species can be.
“The most exciting thing about this study is just how many future directions it opens up,” said Jessica Purcell, an evolutionary geneticist at the University of California, Riverside who studies ant genomes.
Ants attract the attentions of researchers like Kronauer and Trible because most species have a social structure that is wedded to their biology. In a typical nest, a single large, reproductive queen ant presides over legions of smaller, nonreproductive female workers who are her daughters. The workers build a nest, gather food, repel invaders and care for the colony’s young, freeing the queen to just lay eggs.
Some ant species, however, depart from that plan by engaging in forms of social parasitism — that is, they exploit the social structure of another ant species. Slave-making ants, for example, steal larvae from other nests and chemically imprint them to become workers serving the slavers’ queen.
Many decades ago, researchers noticed that some ant species employ a more clandestine kind of parasitism. The parasites have lost their worker caste. To survive, their small queens infiltrate the colonies of other ant species and lay eggs there. The exploited host workers then do everything for them, from taking care of their brood to protecting and feeding them. Such a relationship between species is called obligate parasitism, because the parasites cannot survive on their own.
Because of their wing buds, the mutant ants stand out from the workers to human eyes. Yet they can blend into a clonal raider ant colony by disguising themselves with the scents of workers.
Daniel Kronauer
These workerless social parasites, sometimes called inquilines (from the Latin word for “tenants”), have a distinctive appearance that to human eyes easily sets them apart from their hosts. But their parasitic scheme succeeds because they have evolved ways to steal chemical odors from the host nest to camouflage themselves.
Genomic analyses have shown that ant inquiline species have independently evolved dozens of times, and nearly all of them parasitize a closely related species that looks and behaves as ants normally do. For evolutionary biologists, that posed a mystery: How could a new species of obligate social parasites evolve from its host species? If their ancestors had lived together in the same nest, they would have interbred too easily.
For many years, researchers hypothesized that the initial step had been reproductive isolation: that the early ancestors of the inquilines were normal ants that were reproductively isolated from their kin long enough to diverge genetically from them and become a new species. They could live on their own, but some of them eventually discovered the benefits of sneaking back into the nests of their ancestors for help. Their dependence on their hosts gradually increased, and they evolved from a state of optional or “facultative” parasitism to obligate parasitism.
The problem with that idea, Kronauer explained, is that nobody has ever observed in the wild what should be an essential, early step of the process: free-living, facultative social parasites living in isolation from their close relatives.
Trible and Kronauer’s new findings turn the previous assumptions on their head. Their alternative scenario focused on the pair of mismatched supergenes in the clonal raider ants. Sometime in history, one of those ants had experienced a mutation that replaced the supergene on one chromosome with a copy of the supergene from the other chromosome. The resulting mutant ant with two copies of the “parasitic” version of the supergene could have suddenly developed into a miniature queen that looked a lot like an inquiline.
The work showed that a single mutation in a supergene was sufficient to produce the full suite of changes observed in the obligate parasites, even before the ants were split by speciation.
“You can go from free-living to obligately parasitic in one step, and you don’t need to take a number of gradual steps involving a reproductively isolated facultative intermediate population,” said Trible, who is now at Harvard University. “What we can be sure of is that a free-living parent had a daughter who was immediately an obligate parasite.”
He continued: “That is the scenario that had never been entertained by any of the classical evolutionary theorists, because that’s the scenario that was thought to be too big of a jump for you to take.”
The fact that a single mutation can shift all of these traits in a single step “really changes the way we think about the evolution of these weird, workerless social parasites,” Kronauer said.
Little is known about the evolutionary history of the supergene on chromosome 13 that confers the social parasite phenotype. However, it is unlikely to have evolved in a clonal species like the raider ants. “The clonal ants would have been the last place to look for supergenes,” said Michel Chapuisat, who studies ant supergenes at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland.
The reason is that all the ants in a clonal species are genetically identical: Random mutations aside, their genomes pass unchanged from parent to child. Something more complicated, however, happens in sexually reproductive species.
In the cells that produce eggs and sperm, the maternal and paternal copies of the chromosomes line up and swap corresponding segments of DNA. This process of “recombination” allows sets of inherited traits to be reshuffled randomly; without it, genes would be locked into the maternal or paternal lineages forever.
Because of recombination, genes for various parasitic behaviors could have been randomly brought together on chromosome 13. Natural selection would then have strongly favored the union of those alleles that worked well together. “If you have a parasite-determining gene, you can gradually put a bunch of other genes next to it that make [the ant] better and better at being a parasite,” Trible said.
Recombination might have eventually separated those genes again, but a fateful genetic accident intervened. Sometimes when chromosomes are being repaired after damage, a piece of DNA gets reinserted in an inverted orientation. Because inverted DNA can’t line up with its chromosomal counterpart, it can’t recombine, so any genes in the DNA are permanently locked together as a new heritable unit — a supergene.
That may be what happened on chromosome 13: An inversion in that 2.25-million-base-pair stretch of DNA could have locked together the traits for social parasitism as a supergene, which natural selection then maintained. Purcell noted that a lot of research surrounds other ways that a supergene like this one could have emerged, but “there’s such a strong benefit of having alleles that work well together, brought together into a region with low recombination,” she said.
In Kronauer’s laboratory at Rockefeller University, clonal raider ants are maintained in a facility that allows the behaviors of hundreds of ants to be monitored at once.
Daniel Kronauer
Chapuisat thinks it’s likely that the supergene for all the observed parasitic traits evolved over a long time in a sexual ancestor of the clonal raider ants. The parasitism would have manifested in the ants that carried two copies of the supergene, and the ants with one or no copies would have been their hosts. When the raider ants became clonal and heterozygous, with just one copy of the supergene, the parasitic behavior disappeared — but the supergene persisted. And when a mutation eventually created new homozygous clonal raiders, the dormant supergene traits were reactivated and the miniature queenlike mutants appeared overnight.
This ant supergene is far from an isolated example; if anything, it may illustrate a more general and still underappreciated way in which many complex traits evolve.
“There are more and more studies that show us that genome rearrangements can have a fundamental influence on behavior and on social organization of species,” said Christian Rabeling, an entomologist at the University of Hohenheim in Stuttgart, Germany, who studies how social parasitism evolved in ants.
In the 30-million-year-old, sexually reproducing genus of Formica ants, for example, there are at least four lineages in which a shared supergene determines whether their colony will have one queen or many. Other groups of ants have supergenes that they evolved independently, controlling suites of behavioral and morphological traits important to their way of life, Purcell said.
All of these supergenes could be what Trible and other researchers now call “social chromosomes.” Just as the X and Y sex chromosomes in humans determine sex, the supergenes in the ants determine the social organization of colonies. It’s not a glib comparison for Trible. Supergenes and sex chromosomes both bundle up genes that then are always inherited together and collectively confer sets of traits. Just as some sex-linked traits are advantageous for males or females but not both, the parasitic supergenes can be advantageous for the homozygous inquilines but not the heterozygous hosts.
“For some reason, population geneticists have set aside sex chromosomes like a separate form of evolution,” Trible said. Although it’s still uncertain how common the social chromosomes are, “what [they] are telling us is that supergenes are all over the place, and sex chromosomes are a special case of a supergene.”
Which exact genes and control elements are bundled up within the supergene of the clonal raider ants is still unknown. But dissecting that supergene and others in different ant species may reveal something about the evolution and development of castes in ant colonies. When an ant larva is developing, environmental cues determine whether it will become a queen or a worker, a decision that dictates the larva’s behavior, its body size, the development of its wings and ovaries, and its ability to lay eggs. Those traits are so strongly associated that researchers have found that experimentally shifting one usually pulls the others along with it. Trible and Kronauer think that by learning how the parasitism supergene altered the correlation between body size and the other queen-associated traits, researchers may be able to uncover the genetic mechanisms for normal caste development.
The mutants are classified as social parasites because after they lay their eggs in a nest, they leave all the care and feeding of their offspring to the workers.
Daniel Kronauer
Trible and Kronauer’s work also raises other questions about evolution and development, including how a supergene mutation relates to speciation. In the Formica ants, the single-queen and multi-queen colonies don’t seem to be splitting into independent lineages. Both forms of the supergene seem to be comfortably maintained as a “polymorphism” within a single species.
For Chapuisat, the question is whether the queenlike mutants are a “cheater lineage” behaving like a parasite within the clonal raider ant species. “Or is it on its way to become a separate species?” he asked.
How exactly a speciation event could happen after the parasitic phenotype arises is a mystery, but this kind of supergene mutation provides a plausible mechanism for rapid speciation through social parasitism, Purcell said. Both she and Chapuisat warned, however, that all these questions and speculations are complicated by the slipperiness of defining what a species is in a clonal organism like these ants.
To demonstrate that a supergene mutation actually is the mechanism by which social parasite species evolve, Rabeling suggests that it will be important to see if the inversions on chromosomes, which are structural hallmarks of supergenes, are present in many host-parasite pairs. Do the dozens of other inquiline ant species have similar supergene mutations?
Rabeling believes there may be other mechanisms, such as hybridization, that could also create the supergene with this constellation of traits. “I would expect that there is not only one mechanism for how social parasitism evolves, but it is probably many different mechanisms,” he said. “And the more empirical systems we study, the more mechanisms for the origin of social parasitism we would probably find.”

224,Do black holes pose danger to Earth?,https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/1068322-do-black-holes-pose-danger-to-earth,"Black holes are one of the most mysterious objects that exist in space. They are formed when a star implodes. It is also present at the centre of giant galaxies. Its gravitational pull is so powerful that any object which enters its event horizon cannot be escaped. Even light succumbs to the black hole.
The black hole contains a massive about of matter in a very small area. 
The amount of mass a black hole can contain is likened to a star 10 times more massive than our sun squeezed into a sphere about as wide as New York City, said Nasa.
It also highlighted that a black hole cannot be seen directly by scientists but they can observe the impact of its incredible mass on its surroundings.
Nasa said black holes can devour stars, tearing the celestial objects apart as their powerful gravitational field pulls the stars closer.
However, scientists also underlined that that black holes can help spur the growth of new stars.
Nasa explained that if a person fell inside a black hole, the individual's perception of space and time would change. Additionally, the immense gravity of the black hole would compress you horizontally and stretch you vertically like a noodle, in a phenomenon known as ""spaghettification"".
According to Nasa, in our Milky Way galaxy, there are as many as 10 million to one billion stellar black holes. 
These black holes are the remnants of a massive star that collapsed and are approximately 10 to 24 times as massive as our sun.
There are other black holes that are dubbed supermassive black holes, present nearly at the centre of every giant galaxy. 
According to the Space Telescope Science Institute, scientists estimate there may be about 100 billion supermassive black holes in our region of the Universe.
Sagittarius A* is present at the centre of our Milky Way galaxy. The black hole has a mass of about 4 million suns, stated Nasa.
The supermassive black hole present in our milky way is at a distance of more than 26,000 light years, or 152 quadrillion miles, away from Earth. 
Nasa said: “Sagittarius A* is our closest supermassive black hole.”
In a recent discovery, astronomers had spotted the closest black hole to our planet. 
National Science Foundation noted: “About 10 times more massive than the sun, the black hole is only about 1,600 light-years away. Located in the constellation Ophiuchus, the black hole is three times closer to Earth than the previous record holder.”
Scientists maintained that the nearby black hole is a dormant black hole, meaning that it is not actively feeding.
Is there any threat to Earth from any of the black holes? The answer is no because Nasa said that no black hole is close enough to be a danger to us. Additionally, the sun is not massive enough to explode to form a black hole.

225,Popular Explanation Is Wrong – Researchers Discover New Clues Regarding the Origin of Earth’s Continents,https://scitechdaily.com/?p=274953,"
By Smithsonian
May 8, 2023

Despite being a crucial factor in making Earth a hospitable place for life compared to other planets in the solar system, the origins and unique characteristics of continents, massive segments of the planet’s crust, remain largely enigmatic.
A recent study conducted by Elizabeth Cottrell, a research geologist and rock curator at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History, and Megan Holycross, formerly a Peter Buck Fellow and National Science Foundation Fellow at the museum and now an assistant professor at Cornell University, has advanced our knowledge of Earth’s crust by testing and disproving a widely held theory regarding the lower iron content and higher oxidation levels of continental crust compared to oceanic crust.
The iron-poor composition of continental crust is a major reason why vast portions of the Earth’s surface stand above sea level as dry land, making terrestrial life possible today.
The study, recently published in the journal Science, uses laboratory experiments to show that the iron-depleted, oxidized chemistry typical of Earth’s continental crust likely did not come from crystallization of the mineral garnet, as a popular explanation proposed in 2018.
The building blocks of new continental crust issue forth from the depths of the Earth at what are known as continental arc volcanoes, which are found at subduction zones where an oceanic plate dives beneath a continental plate. In the garnet explanation for continental crust’s iron-depleted and oxidized state, the crystallization of garnet in the magmas beneath these continental arc volcanoes removes non-oxidized (reduced or ferrous, as it is known among scientists) iron from the terrestrial plates, simultaneously depleting the molten magma of iron and leaving it more oxidized.

One of the key consequences of Earth’s continental crust’s low iron content relative to oceanic crust is that it makes the continents less dense and more buoyant, causing the continental plates to sit higher atop the planet’s mantle than oceanic plates. This discrepancy in density and buoyancy is a major reason that the continents feature dry land while oceanic crusts are underwater, as well as why continental plates always come out on top when they meet oceanic plates at subduction zones.
The garnet explanation for the iron depletion and oxidation in continental arc magmas was compelling, but Cottrell said one aspect of it did not sit right with her.
“You need high pressures to make garnet stable, and you find this low-iron magma at places where the crust isn’t that thick and so the pressure isn’t super high,” she said.
In 2018, Cottrell and her colleagues set about finding a way to test whether the crystallization of garnet deep beneath these arc volcanoes is indeed essential to the process of creating continental crust as is understood. To accomplish this, Cottrell and Holycross had to find ways to replicate the intense heat and pressure of the Earth’s crust in the lab, and then develop techniques sensitive enough to measure not just how much iron was present, but to differentiate whether that iron was oxidized.
To recreate the massive pressure and heat found beneath continental arc volcanoes, the team used what are called piston-cylinder presses in the museum’s High-Pressure Laboratory and at Cornell. A hydraulic piston-cylinder press is about the size of a mini fridge and is mostly made of incredibly thick and strong steel and tungsten carbide. The force applied by a large hydraulic ram results in very high pressures on tiny rock samples, about a cubic millimeter in size. The assembly consists of electrical and thermal insulators surrounding the rock sample, as well as a cylindrical furnace. The combination of the piston-cylinder press and heating assembly allows for experiments that can attain the very high pressures and temperatures found under volcanoes.

In 13 different experiments, Cottrell and Holycross grew samples of garnet from molten rock inside the piston-cylinder press under pressures and temperatures designed to simulate conditions inside magma chambers deep in Earth’s crust. The pressures used in the experiments ranged from 1.5 to 3 gigapascals—that is roughly 15,000 to 30,000 Earth atmospheres of pressure or 8,000 times more pressure than inside a can of soda. Temperatures ranged from 950 to 1,230 degrees Celsius, which is hot enough to melt rock.
Next, the team collected garnets from Smithsonian’s National Rock Collection and from other researchers around the world. Crucially, this group of garnets had already been analyzed so their concentrations of oxidized and unoxidized iron were known.
Finally, the study authors took the materials from their experiments and those gathered from collections to the Advanced Photon Source at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois. There the team used high-energy X-ray beams to conduct X-ray absorption spectroscopy, a technique that can tell scientists about the structure and composition of materials based on how they absorb X-rays. In this case, the researchers were looking into the concentrations of oxidized and unoxidized iron.
The samples with known ratios of oxidized and unoxidized iron provided a way to check and calibrate the team’s X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements and facilitated a comparison with the materials from their experiments.
The results of these tests revealed that the garnets had not incorporated enough unoxidized iron from the rock samples to account for the levels of iron depletion and oxidation present in the magmas that are the building blocks of Earth’s continental crust.
“These results make the garnet crystallization model an extremely unlikely explanation for why magmas from continental arc volcanoes are oxidized and iron-depleted,” Cottrell said. “It’s more likely that conditions in Earth’s mantle below continental crust are setting these oxidized conditions.”
Like so many results in science, the findings lead to more questions: “What is doing the oxidizing or iron depleting?” Cottrell asked. “If it’s not garnet crystallization in the crust and it’s something about how the magmas arrive from the mantle, then what is happening in the mantle? How did their compositions get modified?”
Cottrell said that these questions are hard to answer but that now the leading theory is that oxidized sulfur could be oxidizing the iron, something a current Peter Buck Fellow is investigating under her mentorship at the museum.

This study is an example of the kind of research that museum scientists will tackle under the museum’s new Our Unique Planet initiative, a public–private partnership, which supports research into some of the most enduring and significant questions about what makes Earth special. Other research will investigate the source of Earth’s liquid oceans and how minerals may have served as templates for life.

226,NASA is developing a snake-like robot to slither through a Saturn moon in search of life - CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nasa-snake-robot-eels-saturn-moon-enceladus-search-of-life/,"Watch CBS News

Is there life outside of Earth? A new snake-like robot could be the one to find out. 
The Exobiology Extant Life Surveyor (EELS) is being developed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory for a space mission to Enceladus, one of Saturn's 83 moons known for its icy surface that's the whitest and most reflective in the solar system. It's believed that there is a liquid ocean under the ice, prompting further investigation into whether life exists within it. 
According to the Jet Propulsion Lab, EELS is a ""snake-like, self-propelled robot"" made of segments with ""first-of-a-kind rotating propulsion units"" that allow it to grip surfaces and move underwater. The hope is that the robot snake will be able to slither its way through vents on Enceladus' surface to get into the ocean below. 
The roughly 16-foot and 220-pound robot is undergoing extensive testing in various environments to make sure it's ready for the job. The ""head"" of the snake will feature technology that allows EELS to capture the world in 3D and send real-time video to operators. Meanwhile its body will be able to carry and deploy a science payload that could allow scientists to capture subsurface pressure, electrical conductivity and temperature. 
Last fall, it underwent testing at the Athabasca Glacier in Canada's Jasper National Park.  
A launch date for EELS has not yet been announced, but researchers hope to finalize the EELS concept by fall 2024.  
""We are early in the project, but it is achievable in our lifetime,"" EELS Deputy Project Manager Rachel Etheredge said last year. ""...It's an ambitious collaboration, and we're motived by the shared excitement we have for this concept, and the potential science we could gather with EELS.""
Once it's ready to go, it would take about 12 years for a spacecraft to carry EELS to the Saturn moon, but researchers hope that it would take only days for the robot snake to reach the ocean once it finds its way into a vent in the icy crust. 
""The EELS system is a mobile instrument platform conceived to explore internal terrain structures, assess habitability and ultimately search for evidence of life,"" NASA says of its development. ""It is designed to be adaptable to traverse ocean-world-inspired terrain, fluidized media, enclosed labyrinthian environments and liquids.""
And if all goes well, the robot snake could take ocean world exploration to the next level, NASA says, allowing ""deeper exploration into areas that were once unattainable.""

227,Strange winds blow on Saturn's moon Titan. New clues may show why | Space,https://www.space.com/saturn-moon-titan-strange-winds-new-clues,"When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.
New research aims to shed light on the puzzling winds on Titan, Saturn's largest moon, whose mysterious weather patterns have puzzled astronomers for decades.
New research is shedding light on peculiar winds swirling on Saturn's largest moon, Titan, whose mysterious weather patterns have puzzled astronomers for decades.
The answers may help to explain how Titan became the only moon in the solar system that still hosts a planet-like atmosphere, researchers say.
Astronomers have long known that seasons on Titan — each of which lasts nearly 7.5 Earth years — affect the moon's winds. But they haven't been able to pin down the speeds of those winds; two related studies, done nearly 30 years apart, have led to contradictory findings.
Now, astronomers are revisiting this decades-old mystery with updated telescopes. The paradoxical findings from past research might have resulted from incorrect assumptions about the data or instrument limitations, or it may just be that ""there's something basic that we don't understand,"" Eliot Young, a principal scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Texas, said in a statement (opens in new tab).
Related: Titan: Facts about Saturn's largest moon
Titan has a thick, smog-like atmosphere that reaches 370 miles (600 kilometers) into space and is 95% nitrogen with a sprinkle of organic molecules. Winds on the moon encircle it in just a day, repeatedly carrying currents of warm air from lower altitudes to the moon's poles, as if blowing on what NASA calls a high-speed conveyor belt.
In 1989, astronomers found that Titan's winds are slowest near its equator and fastest at midlatitudes in both the northern and southern hemispheres. This was revealed thanks to a chance alignment of a star behind Titan that allowed astronomers to study how the star's dimming light filtered through the moon's atmosphere, which helped them interpret wind speeds. 
In 2016, a different team used ground-based telescopes to study how the light beamed by molecules in the atmosphere changed with shifting wind speeds and directions. The findings from this method revealed the opposite: The winds were fastest near Titan's equator and slowest at its lower latitudes.
Because there's a nearly three-decade gap between the two sets of observations, astronomers think different seasons on Titan may have led to the dramatic wind changes between both studies. Also, the 1989 research studied winds circling in the middle layers of the moon's atmosphere, while the more recent research focused on winds in the upper layers, which also may explain the varying wind speeds, the astronomers said.
""Just like on Earth, the winds on Titan are different at different altitudes and also change with seasons,"" Juan Lora, an assistant professor of Earth and planetary sciences at Yale University, told Space.com in an email. ""And both of these likely explain why the observations don't agree perfectly with each other."" 
To get to the bottom of this discrepancy, a group of scientists has collected new data about Titan's winds using both methods at the same time. Last year, the team used eight telescopes in the United States and South America to observe two chance alignments of Earth, Titan and faraway bright stars.
In September 2022, four telescopes in Hawaii — including NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility and the Keck Observatory — watched as the star, 2MASS 21312124-1602427, snuck behind Titan. In November of the same year, a different star called 2MASS 21292356-1611056 slid behind Titan. Data from this event was collected by four more telescopes in Chile, including the Very Large Telescope and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA).

The team is still comparing data from both observations and expects the results to be ready later this year. So far, ALMA observations already show evidence of speedy winds parallel to Titan's equator, Martin Cordiner, a planetary science researcher at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland whose team first identified the discrepancy in 2021, told Space.com.

The researchers behind the latest study said they were just in time to capture valuable data about Titan's winds before the 2025 northern autumnal equinox, when both of the moon's hemispheres will briefly receive equal sunlight before its northern hemisphere points more directly toward the sun. During this time, Titan's winds will reverse directions and start flowing from north to south — a change that has sprouted powerful dust storms (opens in new tab) in the past, according to the journal Nature.
""Titan is amazingly similar to Earth in many ways, but it's also alien and often surprising — teasing out which of these applies to individual phenomena as we observe them is one of the fun bits about this research for me,"" Lora told Space.com.

Scientists are one step closer to understanding how our brains became so uniquely human. Image credit: frank60/Shutterstock.com
A chance rearrangement of the human genome over a million years ago probably kick-started the evolution of modern humans from our primate ancestors. A recent study explains why human DNA contains sections, many of which are involved in brain development, that are unique to us and are not shared with even our closest relatives, chimpanzees.
These stretches of human-specific DNA are called human accelerated regions (HARs). They were discovered almost 20 years ago by Dr Katie Pollard, now director of the Gladstone Institute of Data Science and Biotechnology, who led the new study to try to figure out where they came from. 
“What we found is that many HARs are in regions of DNA where structural variants caused the genome to fold differently in humans compared to other primates,” Pollard explained in a statement. “This gave us an idea how HARs could have arisen in the first place.”
The physical structure of a section of DNA can be an important indicator of its function. The researchers analyzed 241 different mammalian genomes and found that HARs tend to arise in parts of the human genome that are structurally very different to their counterparts in other mammalian genomes. This is important, as the structure of DNA dictates how it’s able to fold in three dimensions.Related StoriesThe Stone Bodies Of Pompeii Aren't What You ThinkDNA Sheds Light On Mystery About Where Native Americans Came FromThe Curious Reason Why King Charles III ""Owns"" All The UK's Swans
“The way the genome folds up in three-dimensional space like origami is particularly important for enhancers,” said Pollard. “That’s because enhancers can impact the activity of any gene that ends up close by, which can vary depending on how DNA is folded.”
The team then used a machine-learning approach to compare human and chimpanzee DNA sequences, and concluded that almost 30 percent of HARs were in genomic regions that were folded differently in humans than in chimpanzees. A difference in folding means new genes are brought closer to the HARs, and these seemingly minor changes could have had drastic consequences.
“Imagine you’re an enhancer controlling blood hormone levels, and then the DNA folds in a new way and suddenly, you’re sitting next to a neurotransmitter gene and need to regulate chemical levels in the brain instead of in the blood. Your instructions are now out-of-date and need to be changed,” Pollard explained.
“We realized that these human-specific structural changes may have created the right environment for HARs to evolve fast in the human ancestor, after remaining almost the same over millions of years of mammal evolution,” added first author Dr Kathleen Keough.
To find out which specific genes were being affected by the HARs, the team performed experiments in human and chimpanzee stem cells. As it turned out, many of the genes they identified are known to play a role in brain development. Exactly how this contributed to the evolution of the human brain is a question the team is keen to answer next.
The findings also chime with those of another recent study from the team. They reported that many of the early changes in HARs had opposing effects: an original mutation might have ""turned up"" associated gene activity too much, and so a further change would have been needed down the line to tweak this.
As Pollard put it, “Something big happens like this massive change in genome folding, and our cells have to quickly fix it to avoid an evolutionary disadvantage. But the fix might kind of overdo it and need to be refined over time.”
The new study adds another important piece to this puzzle in shedding light on how HARs came to be in the first place. Pollard and the team have already started planning the next phase of this research. It’s well known that human and chimpanzee DNA differs by only a tiny percentage – in time, we will hopefully learn more about how these fractional changes set in motion the chain of events that gave us our distinctly human brains.
The study is published in Science.

229,1st lunar eclipse of 2023 darkens the full Flower Moon in eerie photos | Space,https://www.space.com/lunar-eclipse-full-flower-moon-may-2023-photos,"When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.
Earth's shadow partially blocked the light of the sun, creating a penumbral lunar eclipse.
Skywatchers taking in the full moon this month got to witness the first lunar eclipse of 2023.
A penumbral lunar eclipse of the full Flower Moon took place on May 5, 2023 and was visible for much of the Eastern Hemisphere and Antarctica. This type of lunar eclipse occurs when the moon enters the outermost part of Earth's shadow, known as the penumbra. While these eclipses aren't nearly as dramatic as a total or partial lunar eclipse, they nonetheless offer skywatchers the chance to visualize the astronomical alignment of the sun, Earth and the moon in real time.
This particular eclipse appeared as a dark 'smudge' or 'stain' on the outer portion of the moon. Photographers throughout Asia and the Middle East were able to capture the eclipse in the eerie photographs below.

Looking for a telescope to observe the moon or anything else in the sky? We recommend the Celestron Astro Fi 102 (opens in new tab) as the top pick in our best beginner's telescope guide. 
The second lunar eclipse of 2023 will be a partial lunar eclipse on October 28, followed by another penumbral lunar eclipse in March 2024. Be sure not to miss our guide offering a full calendar of lunar eclipses in 2023.
And if you live in the path of a lunar eclipse and want to take photos of it, be sure not to miss our guide on how to photograph a lunar eclipse. 
During the full Flower Moon on May 5, skywatchers in Duhok, Iraq saw the penumbral lunar eclipse appear to just slightly darken one edge of the full moon in the night sky.

Some of the images from Duhok captured a fairly dramatic penumbral lunar eclipse in which the outer edge of Earth's shadow was plainly visible on the face of the moon.

Photographers in Moscow, Russia witnessed the eclipse darken a reddish-looking moon as it sat low on the horizon.

The penumbral lunar eclipse was more dramatic as seen from Banda Aceh, Indonesia, where it appeared to darken one half of the moon's disk.

Farther east, photographers in China captured the moon as it grew significantly darker when Earth's shadow stretched across it.

And in Srinagar, India, moonwatchers were treated to a spectacle as the penumbral eclipse created a distinct shadow across one side of the moon's face.

NASA engineers have come up with a power-saving strategy to eke more time—and more science—out of the Voyager probes, humanity’s longest-running spacecraft, as they continue venturing into unexplored reaches of interstellar space.
And time is of the essence: Voyager 1 and 2 have been flying since 1977, and their power sources have been gradually fading, putting their instruments at risk. Out in the vast abyss of deep space, unfathomably far from our sun, solar power isn’t viable. That’s why engineers equipped each Voyager with a trio of radioisotope thermoelectric generators, or RTGs. These work by converting the heat from the decay of radioisotope fuel, plutonium-238, into electricity. They’re basically nuclear batteries—and they’re finally running out of juice, losing a predictable 4 watts per year. While the Voyagers don’t need that power for propulsion, it’s essential to their ability to collect scientific readings of far-flung charged particles and magnetic fields—so far, humanity’s only opportunity to sample that data in interstellar space.
A couple of years ago, NASA began exploring ways to keep the Voyagers’ instruments running as long as possible. The first move, in 2019, was to start turning off the heaters for the science instruments. That worked; the devices kept working despite temperatures dropping some 50 degrees Celsius, much colder than the conditions they’d been tested in. But it still wasn’t enough, so at the end of March, a NASA team initiated an energy-saving strategy on Voyager 2 that dips into some reserve power meant to protect systems from voltage spikes.
While this strategy does leave the craft more vulnerable, the risk of such spikes seems to be very low, says Suzanne Dodd, the Voyager project manager at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. Assuming all goes well, they’ll start similar voltage management on Voyager 1 as early as this fall. Altogether, Dodd thinks this could buy the probes’ science mission a few extra years. Voyager is still a mission of discovery, she says, and every piece of data the spacecraft obtain in interstellar space is valuable. “I continue to be amazed by these spacecraft and by the engineers who come up with clever ways to operate them,” says Dodd.
Now 45 years old, the Voyagers spent their first two decades flying through the solar system, snapping photos of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune as they zoomed by. Voyager 1 also captured the iconic “pale blue dot” photograph of a tiny, distant Earth. As they kept going, they continued capturing data. They have long outlived their predecessors, Pioneer 10 and 11, which were the first probes to fly by the gas giants but shut down more than 20 years ago. Both Voyagers have flown well beyond the Kuiper belt, a region hosting Pluto and other small, icy bodies. In 2012, Voyager 1 left the heliosphere, the protective bubble of particles and magnetic fields generated by the sun, beyond which lies the interstellar medium. Its twin followed six years later, at which point both were officially in interstellar territory, cruising at 35,000 miles per hour into the unknown.
Today, Voyager 1 is 159 astronomical units from home, and Voyager 2 is at 133 AU, traveling in a different direction. (1 AU is the distance between the Earth and sun, or about 93 million miles.) The spacecraft are surely showing signs of age—the team dealt with telemetry problems on Voyager 1 last year—but the cosmic workhorses are continuing on.

It’s not uncommon for NASA missions to far outlive their expected lifetimes, and to be granted extensions after achieving their main objectives. The Opportunity Mars rover rolled on for nearly 15 years, rather than three months. The Saturn-focused Cassini orbiter, which NASA operated in collaboration with the European Space Agency, persevered for 20 years instead of four. But the Voyagers surely take the cosmic cake. If the energy-conserving gambit of Dodd’s team works, the two could reach the unprecedented age of 50—with a “stretch goal” of reaching 200 AU around the year 2035.
But this will require sacrificing the science instruments one by one.
Voyager 2 still has five instruments humming along: a magnetometer, a plasma wave surveyor, a plasma science experiment, a cosmic ray detector, and a low-energy charged particle detector. The first two only take about 2W to run, and their electronics are in the body of the probe, so they’ll probably be the last to be shut down. The others are housed on the boom of the craft, where it’s frigid, and they use between 3 and  5 watts each, so turning each one of them off would buy another year of life.
Interstellar space might seem completely empty, but it’s not: There are still solar particles and magnetic phenomena to study. “The further we get from the sun, the more interesting it gets because we really don’t know what we might find. And having two Voyager spacecraft is like seeing through binoculars,” says Linda Spilker, the Voyager project scientist at JPL. For instance, astrophysicists expected that outside the heliosphere, the sun’s magnetic field would slowly rotate into the direction of the interstellar medium, and the Voyagers would be able to track that. But they’ve seen no such rotation yet, Spilker says, suggesting models of the magnetic fields need updating.
The spacecraft have also used their instruments to survey interstellar material and to detect radiation from a dazzlingly bright gamma-ray burst in another galaxy last October.
Missions based on newer probes will take advantage of Voyager’s ongoing solar science. As early as 2025, NASA plans to launch the Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP) to survey the heliosphere. The Voyagers are already well outside of the heliosphere, so the measurements from the distant probes can be compared to those from the much closer new one. “Having the Voyagers out there during IMAP will be really wonderful. As we’re seeing imaging with IMAP, the Voyagers are also going to be making valuable measurements locally,” says David McComas, a Princeton physicist who leads the IMAP collaboration. He likens it to doctors taking a CAT scan of a person’s brain for the big picture, plus a biopsy for detailed information.
The Voyagers aren’t done yet, but they already have an impressive legacy. That includes NASA’s New Horizons probe, which glided by Pluto in 2015. Now 55 AU away from Earth, that spacecraft is probing the edge of the heliosphere with newer, better sensors than the Voyagers are equipped with, and it has already taken images of objects that hadn’t even been discovered when the Voyagers launched, like Pluto’s moons and a Kuiper Belt object called Arrokoth. “For all of us at New Horizons, the Voyager team, they are our heroes,” says Alan Stern, the collaboration’s principal investigator and a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute. New Horizons is the only other distant human-made probe still operating, and it could last until 2050, Stern says. The team is now looking for a new target for a flyby.
Inspired by the Voyagers’ tremendous success, engineers are already designing next-generation spacecraft concepts, such as those that could be powered by lasers and lightsails and could one day whiz into our interstellar environs faster and farther than 1970s probes could. What advice should they glean from the Voyagers’ long and healthy lives? First, says Dodd, it’s useful to have plenty of fuel and redundant systems, because even robust instruments eventually fail. And it’s important to pass knowledge on, she says, in case the craft outlives the generation of engineers who designed it.

Reclaiming Space: Progressive and Multicultural Visions of Space Exploration James S. J. Schwartz, Linda Billings and Erika Nesvold (eds) Oxford Univ. Press (2023)
From Star Trek to Apollo 17, space exploration is often framed as humanity pushing collectively towards a better future. But those utopian visions probably won’t mesh with reality. The book Off-Earth explores the ethical implications of humans moving into outer space — and whether those who do can avoid bringing along Earthly problems such as environmental destruction and social injustice. Nature spoke to its author, Erika Nesvold.
Nesvold is a computational astrophysicist, game developer and a member of the team behind Universe Sandbox, a physics-based space simulator. Based in Severn, Maryland, she is also co-founder of the JustSpace Alliance, a non-profit organization that works for a more inclusive and ethical future in space, and co-editor of Reclaiming Space, a collection of essays that explores similar themes.
A lot of people are talking about these topics because of the growth of the private space-flight industry. For decades, human space exploration was done by national agencies with different motivations, different rhetoric surrounding it and different levels of public participation. With private space flight, members of the public — if they get rich enough — can actually think about going into space.

Because of all the terrible behaviour that came out of the colonization model here on Earth. People talk about space as the final frontier — there’s always references to the Wild West. But living on the frontier in the Wild West was not an ideal experience for most, including Indigenous people, women and Black people. We can’t just pick and choose the nice shiny parts of history and apply them to space. We have to also look at what was harmful about those times and how we can avoid that in the future.
It’s not just that we’ll bring all the same problems with us into space. There are certain physical characteristics of the space environment that could make all of this worse — making people more vulnerable to exploitation, for example. People working in space — say, mining asteroids or whatever we send them out to do — are going to be in isolated environments without a lot of oversight or monitoring. They’re going to be at the mercy of their employers for air, water, food and a trip back to Earth.
This has parallels with a lot of environments where we see labour exploitation and abuses on Earth. During my research for Off-Earth, I spoke to a labour-rights activist who talked about the Thai fishing industry, in which migrant workers are hired, their passports are taken away, they’re put on boats and taken off to sea. And they can be kept out there for years and abused without anyone watching. They don’t have a way back. Solutions that work on Earth, such as strong labour unions and regulation to defend workers’ rights, will also help to safeguard future space workers — assuming we put deliberate effort into putting these protections into place.
This felt like one of the most futuristic topics in the book because nobody’s saying, oh, let’s start having children in space. But if we want someday to have a permanent human presence in space, then we have to be able to replenish our population without continually shipping people from Earth. That means human reproduction in space, but there are so many ethical complications.
In the long term, it leads into questions of population control. If you’re in an environment of real scarcity, such as we imagine a space settlement would be, you need to keep your population from getting too big or too small. And we’ve seen on Earth that trying to control a country’s population can lead to some really unethical and horrific practices.

Historians, especially colonial historians, can point to lessons learnt — cautionary tales and also success stories from the past. Anthropologists, sociologists and economists can explain how humans live together and how their culture shapes behaviour, and vice versa. And how all of this affects the success and happiness of communities.
While researching my book I talked to Michelle Brown, a criminologist at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, and Walidah Imarisha, who is a writer, an activist and director of the Center for Black Studies at Portland State University in Oregon. They both taught me a lot about prison abolition and restorative justice. If we talk about maybe not needing prisons in space, then the question is, what’s the alternative? And it turns out there’s a ton of people who are exploring how different cultures around the world handle harm within their communities in ways that don’t involve locking people up in prison.
There’s been discussion that we just need to bring more people to the table, to have more of these conversations across a diverse range of cultural backgrounds, expertise and lived experiences. But even that assumes it’s the Western space industry’s table, and that we get to decide who comes to it. What I’d rather see is more amplification of the conversations that people outside of the Western world view are having about space and their own societies — so that we can encourage a more global conversation that’s not dominated by one country or one cultural viewpoint.
A lot of people in the space industry like to talk about space as if they’re speaking on behalf of all of humanity, which is really disingenuous if you haven’t even consulted with all of humanity about their interests and what their motivations are for space. Someone living in a community whose culture is deeply tied to their land might be much more interested in how space technology could help them to continue protecting and restoring the health of their land and community, rather than imagining relocating to space in the distant future.

Fifty years after astronauts left the Moon, they are going back. Why?
Representation and diversity matters in space and in space travellers. NASA has committed to sending the first woman and the first person of colour to the Moon. It has the responsibility as a US government agency to reflect the demographics of its population and make sure the astronaut corps is as accessible for as many people as possible. In the long term, if you’re looking at creating permanent populations living in space, you want them to be representative of humanity.
One thing I encourage astronomers to do is to learn from scientists in other disciplines, such as genetics, who have had to think about the ethical implications of their research and how they balance, on a personal level, the work and the potential harm it could cause. Having conversations involving different disciplines would be useful.
More broadly, scientists who want to help to build a better future in space but don’t work in policymaking or philosophy can do a couple of things. They can have conversations with their friends and colleagues about what a better future in space would look like, what kind of world in space they would want to live in, and also just focus on making a better society here on Earth today, whatever corner of the globe they live in. If we do manage to make Earth a better place and a nicer society to live in, within our lifetimes, then we’re helping our future in space.

233,What's the oldest known case of cancer in humans? | Live Science,https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/whats-the-oldest-known-case-of-cancer-in-humans,"When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.
The first known case of cancer was discovered in an early human relative's toe bone.
Cancer may seem like a modern disease, but it has affected humans for eons. Scientists have discovered numerous prehistoric human remains indicating the presence of cancer. So, what's the earliest case of cancer on record? And what's the first time that humans wrote about it in medical texts?
The earliest evidence of human cancer comes from an early human relative who lived around 1.7 million years ago. This individual, likely of the species Paranthropus robustus or Homo ergaster, lived with a malignant tumor in their left toe bone. Archaeologists discovered the skeletal remains inside Swartkrans cave, a limestone deposit in South Africa that's often called the Cradle of Humankind for being home to the largest concentration of human relative remains in the world. 
When researchers compared computed tomography (CT) scans of the toe bone fossil with images of modern-day cases of osteosarcoma, an aggressive form of cancer that begins in the cells that form bones, they immediately recognized the distinctive cauliflower-like appearance of an osteosarcoma, according to a 2016 study about the case published in the South African Journal of Science (opens in new tab).
Nowadays, osteosarcoma is one of the most common bone cancers in humans and can occur at any age, although it is most frequently seen in children, teenagers and young adults who are still growing, according to the American Cancer Society (opens in new tab). However, while this prehistoric individual's age is unknown, it appears that they were an adult, the researchers said.

An even older benign tumor was found in a 1.9 million-year-old human relative known as Australopithecus sediba found in South Africa, according to a separate 2016 study in the South African Journal of Science (opens in new tab).
It's not surprising that the oldest known cancer case was in a bone, since organs, skin and other soft tissues are more prone to decay than bones are. 
""Bone is one of the few tissues that can survive in the fossil record,"" Bruce Rothschild (opens in new tab), a vertebrate paleontologist at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh who was not involved in the study, told Live Science.
However, even if cancer is present in a fossil, it often isn't visible to the naked eye and takes further examination to find — which was the case for the toe bone.
""About one-third of cancers will show themselves,"" Rothschild said. ""But you would need to perform an X-ray to determine if something was hidden inside the bone. Most pathologists [today] look at an X-ray before coming up with a diagnosis of a tumor when it involves the bone.""

Although the 1.7-million-year-old toe bone is the earliest known case of cancer in a hominin, a group that includes modern humans, the first written record of cancer doesn't show up until much, much later.
In 3000 B.C. Imhotep — an ancient Egyptian mathematician, physician and architect — wrote what came to be known as the Edwin Smith Papyrus (opens in new tab), a textbook about bodily trauma and surgical procedures. In the text, he detailed 48 medical cases, including several case studies on breast cancer.
The text was written in hieratic, an ancient Egyptian writing system, and was later translated into a two-volume English text by American archaeologist James Henry Breasted. In it, Imhotep described characteristics of different types of tumors, including ""oily tumors"" and ""solid tumors."" He also included descriptions of a breast tumor  — describing it as ""bulging mass in the breast"" that is cool, hard and as dense as an ""unripe hemat fruit"" that spreads under the skin, according to the book ""The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer (opens in new tab)"" (Scribner, 2010). 
While Imhotep gives a number of treatments for the other medical conditions in the text, under ""therapy"" for the breast tumor he wrote, ""There is none."" However, he did note the best practices for binding other types of  tumors, which involved creating an ointment made of grease, honey and lint, according to The Cancer Letter (opens in new tab), which published an excerpt of the historical text. 
—If the brain doesn't feel pain, why do headaches hurt?
—How long does it take for a body to decompose?
—Does it matter what time of day you get cancer treatment?
The papyrus not only offers a glimpse of how surgical medicine was practiced thousands of years ago by ancient Egyptians, arguably some of the world's first surgeons, but also provides some of the earliest evidence of cancer ever recorded, according to a 2016 study published in the journal Cancer (opens in new tab). 
It's unclear how these cases of prehistoric cancer developed. Just like the humans who came before us, we're still trying to figure out what causes many cancers and the best ways to treat them.

234,Galaxy’s Hottest Exoplanet: Alien Atmosphere Holds Rare Terbium Surprise,https://scitechdaily.com/galaxys-hottest-exoplanet-alien-atmosphere-holds-rare-terbium-surprise/,"
By Lund University
May 8, 2023

Lund University researchers discovered the rare metal terbium in the atmosphere of KELT-9 b, the galaxy’s hottest exoplanet. Using a new analysis method, the team can now study exoplanets in greater detail, potentially leading to insights on exoplanets’ ages, formation, and the possibility of Earth-like planets. Credit: Bibiana Prinoth
The rare metal terbium has been found in an exoplanet’s atmosphere for the first time. Researchers at Lund University in Sweden have also developed a new method for analyzing exoplanets, making it possible to study them in more detail.
KELT-9 b is the galaxy’s hottest exoplanet, orbiting its distant star about 670 light years from Earth. The celestial body, with an average temperature of a staggering 4,000 degrees Celsius, has since its discovery in 2016 excited the world’s astronomers. The new study in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics reveals discoveries about the scalding-hot oddball’s atmosphere.
“We have developed a new method that makes it possible to obtain more detailed information. Using this, we have discovered seven elements, including the rare substance terbium, which has never before been found in any exoplanet’s atmosphere,” says Nicholas Borsato, PhD student in astrophysics at Lund University.
Terbium is a rare earth metal that belongs to the so-called lanthanoids. The substance was discovered in 1843 by the Swedish chemist Carl Gustaf Mosander in the Ytterby mine in the Stockholm archipelago. The substance is very rare in nature, and 99 percent of the world’s terbium production today takes place in the Bayan Obo mining district in Inner Mongolia.
“Finding terbium in an exoplanet’s atmosphere is very surprising,” says Nicholas Borsato.
Most exoplanets are discovered by astronomers making measurements of how brightly stars shine. When an exoplanet passes in front of its star, the star’s brightness decreases. Thanks to their advanced measurement method, the researchers have succeeded in filtering out the dominant signals in KELT-9 b’s atmosphere. This opens up the possibility of finding out more about the atmospheres of other exoplanets.
“Learning more about the heavier elements helps us, among other things, to determine the age of the exoplanets and how they were formed,” explains Nicholas Borsato.
Exoplanets, or extrasolar planets, are planets that are in other solar systems than our own. The first confirmed discovery was made in 1992, of an exoplanet orbiting a neutron star. Three years later, the first exoplanet with a sun-like star was discovered. Since then, over 5,000 exoplanets have been recorded. The existence of exoplanets often raises questions about the possibility of life elsewhere in the universe.
Detecting heavy elements in the atmospheres of ultra-hot exoplanets is another step toward learning how the atmospheres of planets work. The better we get to know these planets, the greater chance we have of finding Earth 2.0 in the future,” concludes Nicholas Borsato.

The Moon has been a subject of awe and fascination for millennia, with its shape-shifting powers and enigmatic dark side.
And though it’s the one celestial body on which man has taken (small) steps, we still have big leaps to go in understanding its potential and uncovering its secrets.
However, one hidden feature of the Moon has been unearthed by scientists and it’s very, very big, and very, very heavy.
Buried beneath its South Pole-Aitken basin – one of the largest preserved craters in the Solar System – is a structure which weighs at least 2.18 billion kilogrammes and measures more than 300km (186 miles) in depth and 2,000km (1,243 miles) in length.

The researchers who made the discovery, all based in the US, posited that the “anomaly” could be made out of metal from the core of an asteroid or oxides from the crystallisation of a magma ocean.
 ""One of the explanations of this extra mass is that the metal from the asteroid that formed this crater is still embedded in the Moon's mantle,” lead author Peter B. James, from Houston’s Baylor University, said in a statement shared with IFLScience.
Illustrating just how gigantic this thing is, he went on: ""Imagine taking a pile of metal five times larger than the Big Island of Hawaii and burying it underground. That's roughly how much unexpected mass we detected.”

The groundbreaking finding was made thanks to NASA’s Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission, which measures changes in the Moon’s gravitational field. 
Data collected by GRAIL can then be used to study the internal composition of our cratered companion. 
The South Pole-Aitken Basin has been at the centre of numerous investigations because of just how unique it is.
The region offers clues both on the interior composition of our closest satellite and its history, and who knows what other mysteries it holds...

236,Cosmic Leviathan: Hubble Unveils an Exceptionally Massive Galaxy Cluster,https://scitechdaily.com/?p=275212,"
By ESA/Hubble
May 7, 2023

The Hubble Space Telescope has captured an image of a massive galaxy cluster, eMACS J1823.1+7822, which offers insights into dark matter distribution and acts as a natural telescope to study distant objects. Credit: ESA/Hubble & NASA, H. Ebeling
This Hubble Space Telescope image reveals a massive galaxy cluster, eMACS J1823.1+7822, located nine billion light-years away in the constellation Draco. Gravitational lensing caused by the cluster’s mass distorts background galaxies into streaks and arcs of light, offering insights into dark matter distribution.
A vast galaxy cluster lurks in the center of this image from the Hubble Space Telescope. Like a submerged sea monster causing waves on the surface, this cosmic leviathan can be identified by the distortions in spacetime around it. The mass of the cluster has caused the images of background galaxies to be gravitationally lensed; the galaxy cluster has caused a sufficient curvature of spacetime to bend the path of light and cause background galaxies to appear distorted into streaks and arcs of light. A host of other galaxies can be seen surrounding the cluster, and a handful of foreground stars with tell-tale diffraction spikes are scattered throughout the image.
This particular galaxy cluster is called eMACS J1823.1+7822, and lies almost nine billion light-years away in the constellation Draco. It is one of five exceptionally massive galaxy clusters explored by Hubble in the hopes of measuring the strengths of these gravitational lenses and providing insights into the distribution of dark matter in galaxy clusters. Strong gravitational lenses like eMACS J1823.1+7822 can help astronomers study distant galaxies by acting as vast natural telescopes which magnify objects that would otherwise be too faint or distant to resolve.
This multiwavelength image layers data from eight different filters and two different instruments: Hubble’s Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) and Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3). Both instruments have the ability to view astronomical objects in just a small slice of the electromagnetic spectrum using filters, which allow astronomers to image objects at precisely selected wavelengths. The combination of observations at different wavelengths lets astronomers develop a more complete picture of the structure, composition, and behavior of an object than visible light alone would reveal.

237,Sunspot explosion blasts out M-class solar flares! Causes radio blackout in USA | Tech News,https://tech.hindustantimes.com/tech/news/sunspot-explosion-blasts-out-m-class-solar-flares-causes-radio-blackout-in-usa-71683513367048.html," Copyright © HT Media Limited  All rights reserved. 
The possibility of the Sun causing catastrophic damage on Earth might seem something out of a science-fiction film, but this threat is very true. One of the best examples of Solar activity harming Earth was provided by the Roland Emmerich film 2012. It depicted the apocalypse prophesied by the Mayans many centuries ago. The storyline of the movie revolved around the Sun emitting unstable neutrinos because of anomalous energy processes, which were causing the Earth's core to heat up and eventually lead to its destruction.
Although the ‘science' part of the film was a bit over the top, the threat posed by the Sun could cause significant damage on Earth, and a recent solar flare impact gave us a hint of the Sun's mighty power.
According to a report by spaceweather.com, a Reversed-polarity sunspot, given the designation AR3296, exploded on the Sun, blasting out dangerous solar flares directly towards Earth yesterday, May 7. Forecasters at NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) revealed that this explosion on the solar surface produced a M1.5-class solar flare which lasted for a substantial amount of time.
As soon as this solar flare struck Earth, it caused a shortwave radio blackout over Western USA and the Pacific Ocean, making it harder for Ham Radio operators and Mariners to stay in contact.
The report further revealed that the shortwave radio blackout occurred due to extreme ultraviolet radiation from the flare which ionized the top of Earth's atmosphere. When charged solar particles hit Earth, the radio communications and the power grid are affected when it hits the planet's magnetic field. It can cause power and radio blackouts for several hours or even days. However, electricity grid problems occur only if the solar flare is extremely large.
The NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) carries a full suite of instruments to observe the Sun and has been doing so since 2010. It uses three very crucial instruments to collect data from various solar activities.
They include Helio seismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) which takes high-resolution measurements of the longitudinal and vector magnetic field over the entire visible solar disk, Extreme Ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE) which measures the Sun's extreme ultraviolet irradiance and Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) which provides continuous full-disk observations of the solar chromosphere and corona in seven extreme ultraviolet (EUV) channels.

Kornmesser
The event was spotted in infrared data — also a first — suggesting further searches in this band could turn up more such bursts.
MIT astronomers have discovered a new tidal disruption event in infrared, providing insights into how supermassive black holes rip apart passing stars. This newly found TDE, labeled WTP14adbjsh, is the closest one observed to date, located in the NGC 7392 galaxy about 137 million light-years from Earth. The discovery highlights that traditional X-ray and optical surveys may miss TDEs in star-forming galaxies due to the presence of dust that obscures the light. By searching in the infrared band, scientists can reveal more previously hidden TDEs in active, star-forming galaxies, offering a more complete picture of black holes and their host galaxies.
Once every 10,000 years or so, the center of a galaxy lights up as its supermassive black hole rips apart a passing star. This “tidal disruption event” happens in a literal flash, as the central black hole pulls in stellar material and blasts out huge amounts of radiation in the process.
Astronomers know of around 100 tidal disruption events (TDE) in distant galaxies, based on the burst of light that arrives at telescopes on Earth and in space. Most of this light comes from X-rays and optical radiation.
MIT astronomers, tuning past the conventional X-ray and UV/optical bands, have discovered a new tidal disruption event, shining brightly in infrared. It is one of the first times scientists have directly identified a TDE at infrared wavelengths.
What’s more, the new outburst happens to be the closest tidal disruption event observed to date: The flare was found in NGC 7392, a galaxy that is about 137 million light-years from Earth, which corresponds to a region in our cosmic backyard that is one-fourth the size of the next-closest TDE.
Astronomers at MIT and elsewhere have observed infrared signs of the closest tidal disruption event (TDE) to date. A bright flare was detected from the galaxy NGC 7392 in 2015 (top left panel). Observations of the same galaxy were taken in 2010-2011 (top right), prior to the TDE. The bottom left shows the difference between the first two images, representing the actual, detected TDE.

This new flare, labeled WTP14adbjsh, did not stand out in standard X-ray and optical data. The scientists suspect that these traditional surveys missed the nearby TDE, not because it did not emit X-rays and UV light, but because that light was obscured by an enormous amount of dust that absorbed the radiation and gave off heat in the form of infrared energy.
The researchers determined that WTP14adbjsh occurred in a young, star-forming galaxy, in contrast to the majority of TDEs that have been found in quieter galaxies. Scientists expected that star-forming galaxies should host TDEs, as the stars they churn out would provide plenty of fuel for a galaxy’s central black hole to devour. But observations of TDEs in star-forming galaxies were rare until now.
The new study suggests that conventional X-ray and optical surveys may have missed TDEs in star-forming galaxies because these galaxies naturally produce more dust that could obscure any light coming from their core. Searching in the infrared band could reveal many more, previously hidden TDEs in active, star-forming galaxies.
“Finding this nearby TDE means that, statistically, there must be a large population of these events that traditional methods were blind to,” says Christos Panagiotou, a postdoc in MIT’s Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research. “So, we should try to find these in infrared if we want a complete picture of black holes and their host galaxies.”
A paper detailing the team’s discovery was published on April 28 in Astrophysical Journal Letters. Panagiotou’s MIT co-authors are Kishalay De, Megan Masterson, Erin Kara, Michael Calzadilla, Anna-Christina Eilers, Danielle Frostig, Nathan Lourie, and Rob Simcoe, along with Viraj Karambelkar, Mansi Kasliwal, Robert Stein, and Jeffrey Zolkower of Caltech, and Aaron Meisner at the National Science Foundation’s National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory.
Panagiotou did not intend to search for tidal disruption events. He and his colleagues were looking for signs of general transient sources in observational data, using a search tool developed by De. The team used De’s method to look for potential transient events in archival data taken by NASA’s NEOWISE mission, a space telescope that has made regular scans of the entire sky since 2010, at infrared wavelengths.
The team discovered a bright flash that appeared in the sky near the end of 2014.
“We could see there was nothing at first,” Panagiotou recalls. “Then suddenly, in late 2014, the source got brighter and by 2015 reached a high luminosity, then started going back to its previous quiescence.”
They traced the flash to a galaxy 42 megarparsecs from Earth. The question then was, what set it off? To answer this, the team considered the brightness and timing of the flash, comparing the actual observations with models of various astrophysical processes that could produce a similar flash.
“For instance, supernovae are sources that explode and brighten suddenly, then come back down, on similar timescales to tidal disruption events,” Panagiotou notes. “But supernovae are not as luminous and energetic as what we observed.”
Working through different possibilities of what the burst could be, the scientists were finally able to exclude all but one: The flash was most likely a TDE, and the closest one observed so far.
“It’s a very clean light curve and really follows what we expect the temporal evolution of a TDE should be,” Panagiotou says.
From there, the researchers took a closer look at the galaxy where the TDE arose. They gathered data from multiple ground- and space-based telescopes which happened to observe the part of the sky where the galaxy resides, across various wavelengths, including infrared, optical, and X-ray bands. With this accumulated data, the team estimated that the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy was about 30 million times as massive as the sun.
“This is almost 10 times larger than the black hole we have at our galactic center, so it’s quite massive, though black holes can get up to 10 billion solar masses,” Panagiotou says.
The team also found that the galaxy itself is actively producing new stars. Star-forming galaxies are a class of “blue” galaxies, in contrast to quieter “red” galaxies that have stopped producing new stars. Star-forming blue galaxies are the most common type of galaxy in the universe.
“Green” galaxies lie somewhere between red and blue, in that, every so often they produce a few stars. Green is the least common galaxy type, but curiously, most TDEs detected to date have been traced to these rarer galaxies. Scientists had struggled to explain these detections, since theory predicts that blue star-forming galaxies should exhibit TDEs, as they would present more stars for black holes to disrupt.
But star-forming galaxies also produce a lot of dust from the interactions between and among stars near a galaxy’s core. This dust is detectable at infrared wavelengths, but it can obscure any X-ray or UV radiation that would otherwise be picked up by optical telescopes. This could explain why astronomers have not detected TDEs in star-forming galaxies using conventional optical methods.
“The fact that optical and X-ray surveys missed this luminous TDE in our own backyard is very illuminating and demonstrates that these surveys are only giving us a partial census of the total population of TDEs,” says Suvi Gezari, associate astronomer and chair of the science staff at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Maryland, who was not involved in the study. “Using infrared surveys to catch the dust echo of obscured TDEs … has already shown us that there is a population of TDEs in dusty, star-forming galaxies that we have been missing.”

Two QUT researchers used a standard laptop and a piece of rock from a diamond mine waste pile to solve a long-standing geological puzzle about diamond formation in the Earth’s ancient continents.
Two researchers from Queensland University of Technology (QUT) have utilized a simple laptop computer and a piece of rock, obtained from a diamond mine’s “waste pile”, to unravel a long-standing geological mystery surrounding the formation of diamonds in the deep roots of the earth’s ancient continents.
The lead author, QUT Ph.D. student Carl Walsh, along with QUT Professor Balz Kamber and Emma Tomlinson from Trinity College, Ireland, recently published their findings in the prestigious journal Nature.
Mr. Walsh said the study, for his MSc research, involved computer modeling on a rock from the African continent recovered from the bottom of the lithosphere, the outer part of the Earth between about 30km and 250km below the surface. Mr. Walsh said the dominant part of a continent was the part that you never see.
“If you think of an iceberg – the visible part – if you just had an iceberg floating on the ocean surface it would tip over like a boat. This is like the keel of an iceberg,” Mr. Walsh said.

“We basically had a known starting composition of a rock, which is representative of the earth’s mantle at an early time in the history of the earth before all the continents were formed,” Mr. Walsh said. “We took that starting composition and modeled what would happen to it if it was progressively melted, and what would be left over. And that material is what forms the bulk of the roots of ancient continents that are still around today.”
Professor Kamber, from QUT’s Faculty of Science, School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, said the aim of this research was to use a computer model to see how these deep roots might have formed.
“The model essentially predicts which minerals and melts will be present as you change the temperature of the mantle. So, it’s a predictive tool you can compare with the composition of actual minerals and rocks,” Prof Kamber said.
The piece of rock used for the advanced computer modeling was mined sometime between 1871 and 1914 and ended up in the “waste pile” of the legendary Kimberley diamond mine, best known as ‘The Big Hole’ – a combination open-pit and underground mine – in Kimberley, Northern Cape in South Africa.

The piece of rock they have modeled, garnet harzburgite, was brought to the surface in a kimberlite pipe. The rock was retrieved by Professor Kamber – who specializes in petrology, a branch of geology that studies rocks and the conditions under which they form.
He carefully sledgehammered the rock down to a size that he could successfully ship home.
“It contains a jumble of minerals that were entrained on the way up as they ripped through the base of the whole continent in a supersonic volcanic eruption – the likes of which we have never seen,” Professor Kamber said. “The minerals in this rock sample are so badly hurt, they are screaming still today, they were absolutely smashed.”
“It is so exciting to see this preserved, it is extremely old – 3.3 billion years old. Probably the oldest rock most people will ever hold in their hands,” Professor Kamber said.
Mr. Walsh said the study solved the conundrum of diamonds and the temperatures in which they formed, given a diamond will turn into graphite if heated up too much.
“But yet, when we look at the rocks that contain diamonds, they must have been heated to massive temperatures,” Mr. Walsh said. “So why is it that it is exactly those rocks that experienced the highest temperatures that ended up having diamonds?”
Their research challenges the existing two-step shallow “melting and stacking” explanation.
“Previously, it was believed that most of the ancient deep roots of continents would have been host to diamonds and that these diamonds were destroyed over time, because the base of the continent is continually invaded and eroded by volatile-rich melts and fluids,” Mr. Walsh said. “Our work suggests that actually, this might not be the case, that diamonds are rare today – and were in fact always rare. And that’s because we can for the first time know what is missing from the cradle of the diamond and we can go hunt for it at the surface.”
Professor Kamber said on the present-day earth the heat and temperature distribution in the mantle is not uniform.
“We have areas of relatively uniform mantle temperature and areas where the mantle is a lot hotter. These are known as mantle plumes. And we have expressions of these in Hawaii and Iceland,” Professor Kamber said. “What we’re studying is the effect of ancient plumes – when much hotter plumes than we have now would have hit the base of a growing continent.”
Since conducting the research, Mr. Walsh has traveled to Canberra to recreate similar rocks in the lab at the Research School of Earth Sciences at the Australian National University.

A good article. However, it could have been more complete
I love this article it’s well informative but I have some questions to ask of you guys what happens if I discovered another diamond mine bigger than the one in Africa something that would change the United States forever. I’m talking so big that it would put America the number one place for diamonds please let me back and I will explain more
“He carefully sledgehammered the rock down to size” is not a sentence I expected to read today.

240,Worlds Largest “Raptor” Dinosaurs Lived 10 Million Years Earlier Than Thought,https://scitechdaily.com/worlds-largest-raptor-dinosaurs-lived-10-million-years-earlier-than-thought/,"

The Utahraptor, the world’s largest “raptor” dinosaur, is now estimated to be 135 million years old, 10 million years older than previously thought. The discovery has important implications for dinosaur evolutionary history and narrows the gap in the rock record between the Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods in Utah.
Utahraptor is going to need 10 million more candles on its next birthday cake.
A geological study of the rock formation that encased a fossilized example of the world’s biggest “raptor” shows it’s 10 million years older than previously understood. The report, co-written by a researcher with the University of Kansas, was recently published in the journal Geosciences.
“We determined the age of the dinosaur Utahraptor and found that it was much older than previously supposed,” said Gregory Ludvigson, emeritus senior scientist with the Kansas Geological Survey at KU, who collaborated on the investigation. “That finding has important implications for the evolutionary history of dinosaurs.”
The fieldwork took place in Utah at the well-known Utahraptor Ridge site, named for larger cousins of the ferocious velociraptor dinosaur (known to fans of “Jurassic Park”).
The ridge is home to Stikes Quarry, a fossil quicksand deposit packed with dinosaur fossils that are largely intact and preserved — in much the same positions as when they died. Stikes Quarry is part of the Cedar Mountain Formation, a rock unit containing fossils of more kinds of dinosaurs than any formation in the world.

“We also learned to our complete surprise that the rock strata from the Stikes Dinosaur Quarry were deposited during a global change episode known as the Weissert Event,” Ludvigson said. “This is an agenda-setting discovery that will reverberate for decades.”
More than a decade ago, Ludvigson, along with Jim Kirkland, state paleontologist with the Utah Geological Survey, and Matt Joeckel, state geologist and director of the Conservation and Survey Division at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, joined together to tackle that question.
The scientists and colleagues they recruited took two research approaches: One path — uranium/lead dating of zircon crystals — involved analyzing samples of these minerals collected at different depths in the rock layers. The second looked at changes in the relative abundance of two types of stable carbon isotopes found in buried organic matter.

By comparing results to periods in Earth’s history when global changes in the carbon cycle were known to have occurred, the team showed rocks in the Yellow Cat Member of the Cedar Mountain Formation — and the Utahraptor fossils found within — are 10 million years older than previously known.
Earlier estimates put the age of the rocks and fossils at 125 million years old.
“That’s a lot of evolutionary time,” Ludvigson said. “It’s kind of a vindication of something Jim’s argued for some time, but arguing doesn’t put an absolute age on it, and that’s important to him.”
The revised age indicates the rocks at the Stikes Quarry are at least 135 million years old. The lower part of the Yellow Cat Member encompasses even older strata. The findings narrow the gap in the rock record at the boundary between the Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods in Utah.
“Before, we had a 25-million-year gap between them,” said Kirkland, who first named and described the dinosaur Utahraptor ostrommaysi in 1993. “That’s a third of the age of mammals, more than double the length of time for hominid evolution. It’s a big chunk of time. Anything can happen over 25 million years if you have no record of what’s going on. We’ve plugged that record, for the most part.”

241,Artemis 2 will beam high-speed video from the moon using lasers | Space,https://www.space.com/nasa-artemis-2-laser-communications-video,"When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.
Artemis 2 astronauts will be testing out laser communications around the moon to enable faster transmission of images and video.
NASA is using lasers to evolve how the agency communicates between spacecraft. 
In the past, the space agency has relied on radio signals beamed through its Deep Space Network to transmit any sort of scientific data from deep space probes back to Earth. Lasers, however, have the ability to vastly increase the amount of data spacecraft are able to send, and NASA is ready to send the technology around the moon. 
NASA is including laser communications in the form of the Orion Artemis 2 Optical Communications System (O2O) terminal on Artemis 2, the next crewed mission around the moon. ""Onboard the Orion capsule, the O2O system will send back high-resolution images and video from the lunar region,"" a NASA video published in April states. If all goes according to plan, the system should enable viewers on Earth to see the moon in real-time like never before.

Imagine having dial-up internet for years, then upgrading to gigabit fiber optic speeds. That's essentially what NASA is hoping to accomplish for its future spacecraft. 
To lay the groundwork for future laser communications, NASA has launched several demonstration satellites in recent years. The Laser Communication Relay Demonstration (LCRD) launched in December 2021 was the agency's first laser relay. That was followed by the TeraByte InfraRed Delivery (TBIRD) CubeSat launched last year, which reached data transmission rates of 200 gigabits per second.
Now, NASA is preparing the Integrated LCRD Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) User Modem and Amplifier Terminal (ILLUMA-T), which is expected to launch to the International Space Station (ISS) later this year. ILLUMA-T will attach to the exposed facility on the Japanese Experiment Module. 
Once operational, ILLUMA-T will relay data back to Earth through LCRD in NASA's first end-to-end laser relay communications system, laying the groundwork for the O2O system that will be aboard Orion during Artemis 2.

 —  Meet the 4 astronauts flying on NASA's Artemis 2 moon mission
Still, as NASA notes in its recent video, these experiments are ""only the start of how laser communications are paving the way for advancing our scientific discoveries.""
The success of Artemis 1 last year has put Artemis 2 on an imminent path to launch, which will fly the first astronauts to the moon since 1972. Images from the cameras mounted to Orion captivated the world during the spacecraft's first mission to lunar orbit and back.
With a crew onboard for Artemis 2, NASA expects to transmit not just high resolution images, but video as well. If all goes according to plan with these laser communications experiments, we can expect to see plenty of live or nearly live crew updates with the gorgeous background of the lunar surface visible in Orion's windows.

Researchers from the Max Planck Institute have successfully isolated ancient human DNA from a Paleolithic deer tooth pendant, paving the way for directly identifying the users of artifacts from the deep past and gaining deeper insights into Paleolithic societies.
An international research team led by the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, has for the first time successfully isolated ancient human DNA from a Paleolithic artifact: a pierced deer tooth discovered in Denisova Cave in southern Siberia. To preserve the integrity of the artifact, they developed a new, non-destructive method for isolating DNA from ancient bones and teeth. From the DNA retrieved they were able to reconstruct a precise genetic profile of the woman who used or wore the pendant, as well as of the deer from which the tooth was taken. Genetic dates obtained for the DNA from both the woman and the deer show that the pendant was made between 19,000 and 25,000 years ago. The tooth remains fully intact after analysis, providing testimony to a new era in ancient DNA research, in which it may become possible to directly identify the users of ornaments and tools produced in the deep past.

Artifacts made of stone, bones, or teeth provide important insights into the subsistence strategies of early humans, their behavior, and culture. However, until now it has been difficult to attribute these artifacts to specific individuals, since burials and grave goods were very rare in the Palaeolithic. This has limited the possibilities of drawing conclusions about, for example, division of labor or the social roles of individuals during this period.
In order to directly link cultural objects to specific individuals and thus gain deeper insights into Paleolithic societies, an international, interdisciplinary research team, led by the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, has developed a novel, non-destructive method for DNA isolation from bones and teeth. Although they are generally rarer than stone tools, the scientists focused specifically on artifacts made from skeletal elements, because these are more porous and are therefore more likely to retain DNA present in skin cells, sweat, and other body fluids.

Before the team could work with real artifacts, they first had to ensure that the precious objects would not be damaged. “The surface structure of Paleolithic bone and tooth artifacts provides important information about their production and use. Therefore, preserving the integrity of the artifacts, including microstructures on their surface, was a top priority” says Marie Soressi, an archaeologist from the University of Leiden who supervised the work together with Matthias Meyer, a Max Planck geneticist.
The team tested the influence of various chemicals on the surface structure of archaeological bone and tooth pieces and developed a non-destructive phosphate-based method for DNA extraction. “One could say we have created a washing machine for ancient artifacts within our clean laboratory,” explains Elena Essel, the lead author of the study who developed the method. “By washing the artifacts at temperatures of up to 90°C, we are able to extract DNA from the wash waters, while keeping the artifacts intact.”

The team first applied the method to a set of artifacts from the French cave Quinçay excavated back in the 1970s to 1990s. Although in some cases it was possible to identify DNA from the animals from which the artifacts were made, the vast majority of the DNA obtained came from the people who had handled the artifacts during or after excavation. This made it difficult to identify ancient human DNA.
To overcome the problem of modern human contamination, the researchers then focused on material that had been freshly excavated using gloves and face masks and put into clean plastic bags with sediment still attached. Three tooth pendants from Bacho Kiro Cave in Bulgaria, home to the oldest securely dated modern humans in Europe, showed significantly lower levels of modern DNA contamination; however, no ancient human DNA could be identified in these samples.

The breakthrough was finally enabled by Maxim Kozlikin and Michael Shunkov, archaeologists excavating the famous Denisova Cave in Russia. In 2019, unaware of the new method being developed in Leipzig, they cleanly excavated and set aside an Upper Paleolithic deer tooth pendant. From this, the geneticists in Leipzig isolated not only the DNA from the animal itself, a wapiti deer, but also large quantities of ancient human DNA. “The amount of human DNA we recovered from the pendant was extraordinary,” says Elena Essel, “almost as if we had sampled a human tooth.”

Based on the analysis of mitochondrial DNA, the small part of the genome that is exclusively inherited from the mother to their children, the researchers concluded that most of the DNA likely originated from a single human individual. Using the wapiti and human mitochondrial genomes they were able to estimate the age of the pendant at 19,000 to 25,000 years, without sampling the precious object for C14 dating.
In addition to mitochondrial DNA, the researchers also recovered a substantial fraction of the nuclear genome of its human owner. Based on the number of X chromosomes they determined that the pendant was made, used or worn by a woman. They also found that this woman was genetically closely related to contemporaneous ancient individuals from further east in Siberia, the so-called ‘Ancient North Eurasians’ for whom skeletal remains have previously been analyzed. “Forensic scientists will not be surprised that human DNA can be isolated from an object that has been handled a lot,” says Matthias Meyer, “but it is amazing that this is still possible after 20,000 years.”

The scientists now hope to apply their method to many other objects made from bone and teeth in the Stone Age to learn more about the genetic ancestry and sex of the individuals who made, used, or wore them.

Cold dead rock, indeed.
If you take a minute to think about it, it’s weird that we know anything about the Earth’s core. It is necessarily obscured from our view, and the conditions that far down are so hot and so high-pressured that digging becomes impossible. There is an underground horizon beyond which humanity and our machines cannot pass, unless you’re Luke Perry.
In the SYFY original movie Descent (streaming now on Peacock!), the Ring of Fire — a loop of increased tectonic activity lining the Pacific — starts dumping magma onto the surface and a team of scientists including Dr. Jake Rollins (Perry) must brave a mission to the Earth’s core to save the world from destruction. An active core is a critical component of our cozy planet, but it comes with the occasional natural disaster built in. That’s the cost of planetary paradise.
RELATED: Earth’s inner core might have its own innermost core
Mars, by contrast, might seem like a cold dead rock in the blackness of space, but that isn’t quite true. Just ask NASA’s Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport (InSight) lander. The spacecraft launched May 5, 2018, and entered service on Mars six months later. It spent the next four years listening for marsquakes, in the hope of directly measuring the Martian core.
On Earth, scientists use the behavior of seismic waves to infer information about the planet’s core. To get an idea of how that works, rap your knuckles against a countertop and pay attention to the sound, then put your ear to the counter and knock again. There’s a pretty stark difference between the way sound travels through the counter and through the open air. When an earthquake happens, seismic waves travel through the planet, encountering different materials and conditions along the way.
Scientists can look at the way the waves move through the Earth — are they slowing down or changing direction — to figure out what the Earth is made of. But we can only do that because we have seismic instruments deployed all over the planet. The InSight mission offered the first opportunity to take what we’ve learned about geology directly to another world.
RELATED: Mars’ tiny moon Deimos might be a fractured piece of the red planet itself
While InSight is now retired, having lost contact with Earth on December 15, 2022, scientists still have years of data to sift through. Recently, scientists confirmed that InSight succeeded in the first direct measurements of another planet’s core. The findings were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
Measurements came from two quakes which occurred on August 25 and September 18 of 2021. That was well into InSight’s mission and scientists had had time to acclimate themselves to the measurements, which contributed to the detection. It also helped that one of the quakes was triggered by a meteoroid, which provided a clear point of origin. Both quakes occurred on the opposite side of the planet from InSight, which was crucial for measuring the planet’s core.
Each tremor sends out waves in all directions, but InSight could only pick up on the waves pointed its way. That means if a quake was too nearby, the waves wouldn’t travel through the core before hitting InSight. But when the quakes are far away, like the two identified in the paper, they travel through a considerable portion of the interior before hitting InSight’s detectors. Measurements of these two quakes revealed that Mars has a liquid-iron core which is smaller and denser than scientists anticipated.
This might be the first direct observation of the Martian core, but it likely won’t be the last. Researchers are still digging through all of the data InSight sent back and there’s no telling what else we might learn.

244,NASA Visualization Shows Supermassive Black Holes That Could Swallow Our Solar System Whole,https://singularityhub.com/2023/05/07/nasa-visualization-shows-supermassive-black-holes-that-could-swallow-our-solar-system-whole/,"Hints of black holes, some of the universe’s most extreme objects, first appeared in Einstein’s equations of relativity as early as 1916. It wasn’t until the 1970s that indirect evidence suggested they actually existed. These days, we can watch stars whipping around the black hole at the center of our galaxy and detect the gravitational bell-tones of black holes colliding.
But the first image of a black hole—complete with a glowing disc of material flowing at relativistic speeds into an immense central shadow—made it all concrete. There really are regions of space-time so warped nothing can escape. Look, there’s one right there.
The story gets more mind-bending. Black holes aren’t just extreme for their off-the-charts gravitation, they can also be extremely large. The supermassive black holes lying at the centers of galaxies—like M87*, the subject of that first-ever black hole portrait above—can have masses millions or billions of times more than our sun. At scales like that, the mind fails utterly. Too big.
Luckily, we have (mildly terrifying) NASA visualizations to help our feeble minds make sense of the universe of which we are only a vanishingly small part.
In a new animation, 10 supermassive black holes are placed within the context of our solar system to scale their size. Some of the smaller members of the group are nothing to write home about cosmically. With a measly mass of 4.3 million suns, the diameter of the black hole at the center of the Milky Way—also recently imaged—takes up just half the orbit of Mercury.
M87*, the blurry 5.4-billion-sun subject of the images above, is something else entirely. To traverse the shadow pictured, you’d have to travel beyond the asteroid belt and outer planets to regions it takes spacecraft a decade to reach. Even light, traveling 670 million miles per hour, would take a few days to go from one end to the other.
And there are even bigger fish out there. The distant, 60-billion-sun TON 618, the final black hole in the visualization, could swallow M87*, our entire solar system, and everything in it without a hint of indigestion. Lucky for us, it’s over 10 billion light years away.

245,Marriage in space? Company plans to be the first to offer the service,https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/marriage-in-space-company-plans-to-be-the-first,"Space Perspective

Co-founder of space company Space Perspective Jane Poynter is claiming her firm may just be the first to offer a marriage service in space.
“We’ve already had people wanting to be the first marriage in space, so we’ll see who is the first,” she told The Cool Down on Saturday. The ceremony would likely take place on the company's historic craft Neptune.
“Spaceship Neptune was developed to be the most accessible, most sustainable, and safest spacecraft on or above Planet Earth. It comprises the SpaceBalloon, Reserve Descent System, and Neptune Capsule,” says the firm on its website.
“Unlike all other spacecraft whereby the crewed compartment separates from one flight system mid-flight and transfers to another flight system, Spaceship Neptune’s capsule remains secured to the SpaceBalloon the entire flight from liftoff to splashdown, creating a seamlessly safe and gentle flight.”
But how can it propel itself sustainably? The company even has a solution for that.
“Spaceship Neptune is lifted to space by our SpaceBalloon, propelled by renewable hydrogen, with no rockets and none of the associated carbon footprint,” writes Space Perspective.
“Rather than blasting off, we rise slowly at 12mph, making the experience accessible to anyone medically fit to fly with a commercial airline. Our balloon is proven technology, used for decades already by our team on missions with NASA and other government agencies to lift research telescopes and other heavy, sensitive instruments.”
And what about the spaceship’s return to earth?
“In addition to our primary flight system, Neptune is equipped with a backup descent system—four parachutes situated between the capsule and the SpaceBalloon. The chutes can take over for our primary systems seamlessly and instantaneously in the event of a contingency, ensuring a safe landing. This kind of parachute has been used by space-faring agencies on more than a thousand flights over decades with a 100 percent success rate,” concludes the firm.
Space Perspective is founded by two former crew members of Biosphere 2. The company “is driven by a desire to share the transformative power of space travel with as many people as possible. We know from experience that looking down on Planet Earth from space will radically shift one’s perception of our world and our place within it.” ",1
246,NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day 7 May 2023: Helix Nebula! Will our Sun turn into THIS? | Tech News,https://tech.hindustantimes.com/tech/news/nasa-astronomy-picture-of-the-day-7-may-2023-helix-nebula-will-our-sun-turn-into-this-71683455437252.html," Copyright © HT Media Limited  All rights reserved. 
Nebulae are colossal clouds of gas and dust in outer space that serve as the birthplace of stars, commonly referred to as ""stellar nurseries,"" and occasionally the site of their demise - and sometimes both. One such nebula is the Helix Nebula, which is said to be one of the brightest and closest examples of a planetary nebula. That means, it is a gas cloud created at the end of the life of a Sun-like star. While sharing a picture of this spooky nebula, which was taken with the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) located atop a dormant volcano in Hawaii, USA, NASA asked, ""Will our Sun look like this one day?""
From the viewing angle, it seems like we are observing a helix when we see the outer gases of the star being thrown out into space. NASA explains that the central stellar core, which will eventually turn into a white dwarf star, emits intense light that causes the previously thrown-out gas to glow. While examining the inner edge of the Helix Nebula, it's evident that there are intricate gas knots with unknown origins, the space agency said.
The NGC 7293, commonly known as the Helix Nebula, is located approximately 700 light-years away in the constellation Aquarius and has a diameter of about 2.5 light-years. This nebula is a planetary nebula, which is formed from the remnants of stars that resemble our sun.
NASA says that these stars spend their lifetime undergoing nuclear fusion reactions in their cores, converting hydrogen into helium, and generating light and heat. When the sun exhausts its fuel in about five billion years, it will transform into a planetary nebula.
Not just planetary nebulae, but nebulae form in places where the interstellar medium has enough density to form clouds. This could be possible due to gravity, which might have pulled all the gas and dust together or as mentioned earlier because of the death of a star which emits its particles into space.

247,Why astronomers spotting a star eat planet is bad news for Earth,https://www.chron.com/news/space/article/astronomers-planet-eating-star-18081886.php,"This artist’s impression shows a doomed planet skimming the surface of its star. The same could befall Earth. 
For the first time ever, a group of scientists caught a sun-like star devouring a planet. Unfortunately, the discovery may also foreshadow Earth's fate in about five billion years. In a study published Wednesday in Nature, a team at MIT, Harvard University, Caltech and multiple other institutions detailed that over the course of 10 days in May 2020, they observed a Jupiter-sized planet spiral closely to a dying star that was 1,000 times its size until it was finally engulfed in the star's core. 
The scientists said the star continued to expand and grew 100 times brighter in just 10 days before quickly fading away and returning to its normal state once the meal was over. The planetary demise took place in our galaxy, some 12,000 light-years away near the eagle-like constellation Aquila. ""We were seeing the end-stage of the swallowing,"" said Kishalay De, the study's lead author and postdoctoral student at MIT, in a news release.
It's a sobering reality of what many astronomers believe will also likely befall Earth in the far off future when our own Sun runs out of fuel, balloons and consumes any matter—including the solar system's inner planets—in its wake. Luckily, humans likely won't be around for the event. ""We are seeing the future of Earth,"" De said. ""If some other civilization was observing us from 10,00 light-years away while the sun was engulfing the Earth, they would see the sun suddenly brighten as it ejects some material, then form dust around it, before settling back to what it was."" 
The team reportedly stumbled upon the discovery by accident. De was looking at data from the Zwicky Transient Facility at Caltech's Palomar Observatory for signs of eruptions of binary star systems, in which two stars orbit one another, with one periodically brightening as it pulls mass from the other. ""One night, I noticed a star that brightened by a factor of 100 over the course of a week, out of nowhere,"" De said. ""It was unlike any stellar outburst I had seen in my life."" 
The rendering shows the gas giant meeting its demise as it spiraled into its parent star. Ultimately, the planet plunged into the core of the star, which triggered the star to expand and brighten. 
Additionally, De noticed that the source produced molecules that only exist at cold temperatures, meaning it was not likely to be a binary system. ""Low temperatures and brightening stars do not go together,"" De said. With additional observations taken with an infrared camera at the Palomar Observatory, the team was able to confirm the presence of cold material that appeared to spill out from the source over the next year.
Following further measurements taken by NASA's infrared space telescope NEOWISE, the team realized the source of the cool outburst after learning that the total energy released by the star since it brightened was only 1/1,000th the magnitude of any previously observed stellar mergers. ""That means that whatever merged with the star has to be 1,000 time smaller than any other star we've seen,"" De said. ""That's when we realized: This was a planet, crashing into its star."" 
The scientists concluded that the initial outburst—the bright, hot flash—was likely the final moments of the planet being pulled into the dying star's expanded atmosphere. As the planet was drawn into the star's core, the outer layers of the star blasted away, settling out as a cold dust.
De said that for decades, scientists have only been able to see when planets are still orbiting very close to their star and after when a planet has already been engulfed and star is giant. ""What we were missing was catching the star in the act, where you have a planet undergoing this fate in real-time,"" he said. ""That's what make this discovery really exciting.""

248,Xenobots: The next frontier of biotechnology you need to know about,https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/from-science-fiction-to-reality-xenobots-are-redefining-biotechnology,"Andreus/iStock

Ever imagined a world where we could utilize the power of a living cell to carry out certain functions? Just like we have robots that help in several aspects of our lives, some scientists in US universities have come up with a living robot known as the xenobot.
The xenobot had been predicted to be a valuable tool in medicine and other fields. In years to come, it wouldn't only help treat cancer, but it would help keep the aquatic bodies clean.
But despite this, there had been several controversies on whether the xenobot should be part of our future or not. This article contains everything you would want to know about this living machine.
Xenobot is a robot-like being that is created from living cells. Unlike the synthetic machine robots that we used to know, the xenobot is made through some biotechnology procedures and with organic cells.
It is therefore known to be the first living programmable robot built with the active contribution of artificial intelligence and biology. The xenobot is neither our usual traditional robot nor a plant or animal, but it is a tiny microorganism that can be programmed and configured to carry out a certain task or perform a function.
Generally, the xenobot is known to be 1mm long or less, and it is made from the stem cells of an African frog (Xenopus laevis) which forms the basis from which its name is derived. The xenobot moves in a linear and circular direction, and it could clump together to move in the same pattern or direction.
istock 
After several years of development in Robotics, Biotechnology, and synthetic biology, scientists were concerned about how they could develop living cells that could perform a certain task. This then led some researchers at Tuft University and the University of Vermont to investigate what we now call the xenobot.
In doing this, they collected some stem cells from the embryo of a clawed African frog. The cells were then differentiated into skin cells and heart cells. The skin cells were to provide structure to the bio-robot while the heart cells relax and contract to aid movement. The whole idea of this research was to manipulate and create living cells capable of carrying out a  specific function and having a locomotive ability.
To create the xenobot, a supercomputer was programmed with an evolutionary algorithm with the aim that it'll produce different designs of cell configuration.
Next, the researchers needed to test these designs to check which of them will suit the purpose for which they were created. And so, the supercomputer was used to detect the cell designs that are capable of moving toward an object and those that were not. With this, the researchers were able to find out virtual designs that could move and perform some functions.
But that wasn't all, the researcher had to replicate the virtual procedure manually. And so skin cells and heart cells of frogs were obtained and were joined together using microsurgery tools and following the designs that were successful virtually. With the use of tiny forceps and electrodes, researchers joined thousands of cells together one after the other under the microscope.
Although it wasn't a simple process, the fact that cells have an inherent capability of sticking together made the whole procedure more seamless. After having completed the whole procedure, these researchers were able to build a xenobot that is capable of moving in a direction and circles.  
At first, xenobot could only live for seven to ten days, but with more advancements and research by scientists, it is now capable of healing themselves and living for a long time.
In their original 2019 paper, the scientists set out their hope that one-day xenobots could be programmed to perform useful functions. According to the researchers, ""advances in machine learning, soft body simulation, and bioprinting are likely to broaden the potential applications to which it may be put in the future. Applications could be numerous, given the ease of expressing novel proteins and synthetic biology pathways and computational circuits in Xenopus cells.""
Given their nontoxicity and self-limiting lifespan, they could serve as a novel vehicle for intelligent drug delivery (28) or internal surgery (29). If equipped to express signaling circuits and proteins for enzymatic, sensory (receptor),and mechanical deformation functions, they could seek out and digest toxic or waste products, or identify molecules of interest in environments physically inaccessible to robots. 
If equipped with reproductive systems (by exploiting endogenous regenerative mechanisms such as occurs in planarian fissioning), they may be capable of doing so at scale. In biomedical settings, one could envision such biobots (made from the patient's own cells) removing plaque from artery walls, identifying cancer, or settling down to differentiate or control events in locations of disease. A beneficial safety feature of such constructions is that in the absence of specific metabolic engineering, they have a naturally limited lifespan.
Xenobots could one day be a very useful tool in the fight against cancer. In the future, perhaps ""biobots"" made from the patient's own cells could be designed to seek out and destroy cancer cells or to deliver targeted immunotherapy directly to the affected cells. 
Using bots made from the patient's own cells would reduce or eliminate the chances of rejection or other complications.
Such biobots could also potentially be used to remove plaque from artery walls or differentiate or control cell function events to eliminate certain types of disease. One safety feature of such biobots would be that ""in the absence of specific metabolic engineering, they have a naturally limited lifespan.""
Apart from the treatment of cancer and heart disease, scientists had also claimed that xenobot could also one day be capable of delivering medicine to some particular region of the body or helping fight diseases that affect some crucial body parts. This will particularly be made possible because of the tiny nature of xenobot which makes it easier for them to reach any part of the body.
The numerous industrial activities in our world today have brought about the release of harmful chemical wastes and microplastics into almost every body of water on the planet. While some of these waste materials can be removed through mechanical or other means, many types of pollution are almost impossible to eliminate. One such that cannot be easily removed is the microplastics present in every water system on the planet.
The researchers suggest that Xenobots could one day be programmed to ""seek out and digest toxic or waste products and microplastics, or identify molecules of interest in environments physically inaccessible to robots."" The bots' ability to replicate could also be exploited to allow them to undertake this function at scale. 
Additionally, it has been proposed that xenobot could also be able to detect harmful radioactive elements in the environment. And apart from that, it will be able to get rid of or clean up nuclear materials from places where they aren't wanted. 
Xenobots could well be a valuable tool in the future. However, there are also a number of ethical issues surrounding the use of living robots that are of concern to bioethicists. As Nita Farahany, Duke University professor of law and philosophy, told Smithsonian Magazine, ""Any time we try to harness life ... [we should] recognize its potential to go really poorly."" After all, altering complex systems like cells can lead to unintended consequences. Concerns include:
●     It has been argued that xenobots could begin to malfunction or develop new ""programming"" and perhaps even develop into more complex life forms. Therefore, there should be guidelines to prevent this, if possible.
●     Since xenobots can also potentially be used to introduce life-saving medicine into the human body, they could also be manipulated to transport harmful substances into the body, such as harmful drugs or poisons. 
●     There had also been arguments involving the creation of organisms from human stem cells - which can be harvested from human embryos. Guidelines on the harvesting of stem cells could forestall this. In fact, there may come a time when everyone has stem cells harvested at birth from their umbilical cord, and stored up to create personal bots. However, this also comes with its own set of ethical considerations - such as how to manage the cost.
●     It had also been argued that for us to fully maximize the usefulness of this Biotechnology, it could become necessary to use xenobots to carry out complex tasks. Scientists could therefore need to develop xenobots with nervous and sensory cells,machines which make them closer to sentient beings.
●     Questions may arise in patenting xenobots. Are they a living organism? If so, can they be patented? And if they can't be patented, how can they be protected as intellectual property?
●     Xenobots are neither machine nor living things. They exist in an undefined between state. This could lead us to question our definition of living and non-living organisms. 
●     Also, in the future, xenobots could even be used to alter body systems, including reproductive, nervous, and circulatory systems - perhaps extending life or giving us 'superpowers.' It, therefore, becomes more important to redefine what we term living organisms.
On the whole, it is crucial that, as scientists continue to experience more advances in synthetic biology, regenerative medicine, and Robotics, more ethical rules and procedures should be provided to guide them in the use of xenobots.
With the valuable importance which xenobots had been proposed to carry out, having a stay with us and becoming part of our future is crucial and possible.
istock 
In the medical field alone, xenobots have the potential to provide treatment for some intractable diseases. The fact that we already established that this living machine could help fight against some ailments potentially makes them an essential tool that must be part of us. Apart from that, our environment could benefit from those tiny living machines in order to be intact, preserved, and healthy.   
While we can't underestimate the value xenobot would render to our lives, which inherently is the reason they should be part of our future, ethical codes and standards that would guide us against their harmful use need to be developed under close consideration of their benefits and harms. 
With our ever-changing world of robotics and biotechnology, we should expect more advanced xenobots in years to come. Not only could xenobots be a great living tool in medicine, but they could even help in the fight against global warming. ",1

Engineers at the University of Pittsburgh are bringing concrete into the 21st century by reimagining its design. Concrete, which has its roots dating back to the Roman Empire, remains the most widely utilized material in the construction industry.
A new study presents a concept for the development of smart civil infrastructure systems with the introduction of metamaterial concrete. The research presents a concept for lightweight and mechanically-tunable concrete systems with integrated energy harvesting and sensing capabilities.
“Modern society has been using concrete in construction for hundreds of years, following its original creation by the ancient Romans,” said Amir Alavi, assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at Pitt, who is the corresponding author on the study. “Massive use of concrete in our infrastructure projects implies the need for developing a new generation of concrete materials that are more economical and environmentally sustainable, yet offer advanced functionalities. We believe that we can achieve all of these goals by introducing a metamaterial paradigm into the development of construction materials.”
Alavi and his team have previously developed self-aware metamaterials and explored their use in applications like smart implants. This study introduces the use of metamaterials in the creation of concrete, making it possible for the material to be specifically designed for its purpose. Attributes like brittleness, flexibility, and shapeability can be fine-tuned in the creation of the material, enabling builders to use less of the material without sacrificing strength or longevity.
“This project presents the first composite metamaterial concrete with super compressibility and energy harvesting capability,” said Alavi. “Such lightweight and mechanically tunable concrete systems can open a door to the use of concrete in various applications such as shock absorbing engineered materials at airports to help slow runaway planes or seismic base isolation systems.”
Not only that, but the material is capable of generating electricity. While it cannot produce enough electricity to send power to the electrical grid, the generated signal will be more than enough to power the roadside sensors. The electrical signals self-generated by the metamaterial concrete under mechanical excitations can also be used to monitor damage inside the concrete structure or to monitor earthquakes while reducing their impact on buildings.
Eventually, these smart structures may even power chips embedded inside roads to help self-driving cars navigate on highways when GPS signals are too weak or LIDAR is not working.
The material is composed of reinforced auxetic polymer lattices embedded in a conductive cement matrix. The composite structure induces contact-electrification between the layers when triggered mechanically. The conductive cement, which is enhanced with graphite powder, serves as the electrode in the system. Experimental studies show that the material can compress up to 15% under cyclic loading and produce 330 μW of power.

The research team is partnering with the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) through the IRISE Consortium at Pitt to develop this metamaterial concrete for use on Pennsylvania roads.
The project included researchers from Johns Hopkins University, New Mexico State University, the Georgia Institute of Technology, Beijing Institute of Nanoenergy and Nanosystems, and Pitt’s Swanson School of Engineering.

252,A “Window Into Evolution” – Mathematicians Uncover Universal Explanatory Framework,https://scitechdaily.com/a-window-into-evolution-mathematicians-uncover-universal-explanatory-framework/,"
By Queensland University of Technology
May 6, 2023

Researchers have recently discovered fundamental molecular-level design principles that help maintain important molecules within narrow concentration ranges in biological systems, contributing to robustness and survival. This ground-breaking research provides a universal framework for understanding robust perfect adaptation (RPA) and could lead to fresh approaches in tackling personalized medicine challenges like cancer drug resistance, addiction, and autoimmune diseases.
Mathematicians have uncovered a universal explanatory framework that provides a “window into evolution.” This framework explains how molecules interact with each other in adapting to changing conditions while still maintaining tight control over essential properties that are crucial for survival.
According to Dr. Araujo from the QUT School of Mathematical Sciences, the research results provide a blueprint for the creation of signaling networks that are capable of adapting across all life forms and for the design of synthetic biological systems.
“Our study considers a process called robust perfect adaptation (RPA) whereby biological systems, from individual cells to entire organisms, maintain important molecules within narrow concentration ranges despite continually being bombarded with disturbances to the system,” Dr. Araujo said.
“Until now, no one had a general way to explain how this vital process was orchestrated at the molecular level through the vast, complex, often highly intricate networks of chemical reactions among different types of molecules, mostly proteins. We have now solved this problem, having discovered fundamental molecular-level design principles that organize all forms of biological complexity into robustness-promoting, and ultimately, survival-promoting, chemical reaction structures.”
Dr. Araujo said they had found that collections of interacting molecules in living systems cannot simply ‘transmit’ biochemical signals but must actually make ‘computations’ on these signals.
“These complex intermolecular interactions must implement a special type of regulation known as integral control – a design strategy known to engineers for almost a century.
“However, signaling networks in nature are vastly different, having evolved to rely on the physical interactions between discrete molecules. So, nature’s ‘solutions’ operate through remarkable and highly intricate collections of interactions, without engineering’s specially designed, integral-computing components, and often without feedback loops.
“We show that molecular network structures use a form of integral control in which multiple independent integrals, each with a very special and simple structure, can collaborate to confer the capacity for adaptation on specific molecules.
“Using an algebraic algorithm based on this finding, we have been able to demonstrate the existence of embedded integrals in biologically important chemical reaction networks whose ability to exhibit adaptation could never before be explained by any systematic method.”
Professor Liotta said the quest to uncover the fundamental design principles of biological systems throughout nature is considered to be one of the most important and far-reaching grand challenges in the life sciences.
“On the basis of this ground-breaking new research, RPA currently stands alone as a keystone biological response for which there now exists a universal explanatory framework.
“It’s a framework that imposes strict and inviolable design criteria on arbitrarily large and complex networks, and one that now accounts for the subtleties of intricate intermolecular interactions at the network microscale.
“At a practical level, this discovery could provide a completely fresh approach to tackle grand challenges in personalized medicine such as cancer drug resistance, addiction, and autoimmune diseases.”

253,Nanoscale Breakthrough – A Single-Molecule Valve,https://scitechdaily.com/nanoscale-breakthrough-a-single-molecule-valve/,"
By Osaka Metropolitan University

The scientific community envisions utilizing minute molecules as foundational elements to construct objects, similar to how we assemble things with mechanical components. However, the challenge lies in the fact that molecules are incredibly small, approximately one hundred millionth the size of a softball, and they move randomly in liquids, making it difficult to control and manipulate them into a single form.
To overcome this obstacle, “nanofluidic devices” that can convey molecules through remarkably narrow channels, similar in dimension to one-millionth of a straw, have garnered interest as a means of directly controlling individual molecules in solutions.
A joint research team led by Associate Professor Yan Xu of the Osaka Metropolitan University Graduate School of Engineering has succeeded in regulating the flow of single molecules in solution by opening and closing a nanovalve in a nanofluidic device by applying external pressure.

The research team fabricated a nanofluidic device with a thin, flexible glass sheet on the top, and a hard glass plate with small structures that forms nanochannels and nanovalve seats on the bottom. By applying external pressure to the flexible glass sheet to open and close the valve, they succeeded in directly manipulating and controlling the flow of individual molecules in solution.
They also found that when they trapped single fluorescent molecules in the nanospace inside the valve, the fluorescence of the single molecules became brighter. This happened because the small space made it harder for the single molecules to move around randomly.
Professor Xu said that “this effect of fluorescence signal amplification could help with detecting very small amounts of pathogens for early diagnosis of diseases such as cancers and Parkinson’s disease, without requiring expensive equipment.”
The findings of this study could be a significant step towards freely assembling materials using single molecules as building blocks in solution. This technology has the potential to be useful in various fields, such as developing personalized medicines for rare diseases and creating better displays and batteries. Its applications are limitless.
“We have been addressing various challenges by proposing and promoting the concept of ‘Single-Molecule Regulated Chemistry (SMRC),’ where molecules are treated as building blocks and all processes involved in chemical and biochemical reactions in solution are performed on a single-molecule basis. The single-molecule valve marks the first step towards the goal, which could one day revolutionize chemistry, biology, and materials science, as well as transform various industries,” said Professor Xu.

256,Chicago Fire dismiss Ezra Hendrickson as head coach - The Athletic,https://theathletic.com/4498750/2023/05/08/chicago-fire-ezra-hendrickson/,"MLS
30 
The Chicago Fire have parted ways with head coach Ezra Hendrickson, sources with knowledge of the decision have told The Athletic. Sources were granted anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the decision.
Frank Klopas, who was an assistant under Hendrickson, will be the Fire’s head coach through the rest of 2023, the sources said. The club has also parted ways with assistant Junior Gonzalez. Assistants CJ Brown and Zach Thornton remain on the staff. 
Hendrickson had been in charge of the Fire since the 2022 season. The club missed the playoffs last year, finishing 12th place in the East, and currently sit second-bottom in the conference this season with 11 points after 10 games. 
Chicago has dropped six points from winning positions this season, including late goals to drop points in three of their last four MLS results. The Fire have a league-worst -7 goal difference after the 60th minute.

The Fire have reached the postseason in just one of the last 11 seasons (2017). The club hasn’t advanced in the playoffs since 2009.
This will be Klopas’ third stint as coach of the Fire. The former Fire forward served as coach from 2011-13, with a 39-29-23 record in that stint. The Fire finished third in the Eastern Conference and made the playoffs in 2012 and finished sixth in 2013, missing the playoffs on a tiebreaker for goals scored. Klopas was also named interim manager in 2021 after Raphael Wicky was fired, going 2-3-1.

257,Will scratched Kentucky Derby favorite Forte be eligible for Preakness Stakes?,https://www.wlky.com/article/forte-preakness-stakes-kentucky-derby-eligibility-horse/43829469,"The latest breaking updates, delivered straight to your email inbox.
Following his scratch from the Kentucky Derby, there may be more bad news for Forte.
Forte was scratched from Kentucky Derby 149 on the morning of, with a bruise on his front right foot. Before scratching, Forte was the morning line favorite.
The Kentucky Horse Racing Commission gave an update on Monday, saying that Forte has been placed on a mandatory 14-day veterinary list after scratching on Saturday. 










Kentucky Derby favorite horse Forte scratched on morning of race






According to the commission, this is common practice for a horse whose scratch is related to soundness.
""Forte was scratched from the Kentucky Derby by KHRC veterinarians following Saturday's routine soundness checks. As is the case with all KHRC veterinary scratches related to soundness, and pursuant to HISA Rule 2241(a), this places Forte on a mandatory 14-day veterinary list,"" read KHRC's statement. ""After 14 days, the requirements for removal from the list include a satisfactory workout performed for a state regulatory veterinarian and a negative blood sample result.""
This 14-day hold on Forte could interfere with his chances for running in the Preakness Stakes, which is exactly 14 days after the Derby on May 20. 
The KHRC did not comment on whether or not Forte would be ruled out for that race.
WLKY has also reached out to Forte's trainer, Todd Pletcher, for more information about how this could affect the horse's chances of running the Preakness. 
Forte was at Churchill Downs on Monday morning training again, and Pletcher had said he would workout Friday or Saturday, but that was before the KHRC ruling came out.

The Cardinals had it bad enough, being more than 10 games under .500. Now they’re the biggest story in the sport, with this latest confusing saga surrounding Willson Contreras. We have all you need to know, plus Kenley Jansen and the pitch clock, Orlando Arcia’s return, and a 56-year-old rookie? I’m Levi Weaver, here with Ken Rosenthal — welcome to The Windup!
OK, let’s start with a timeline:
• September 2022: Retiring Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina sends a jersey over to Willson Contreras in the Cubs clubhouse. Rather than frame it, Contreras puts it on, and “seeing his reflection in a Cardinals jersey solidified the decision … He wanted to be a Cardinal,” according to Katie Woo’s story this spring.

• Dec. 7, 2022: The Cardinals sign Contreras, formerly of the division-rival Cubs, for five years and $85 million.
• May 6, 2023: The Cardinals call up catcher Tres Barrera, a move that Woo reported took Contreras by surprise. Woo reports that Contreras will be moved off catcher, playing DH and outfield. In his quotes, Contreras mentions DH, but not outfield.
In a turn of events, the #STLCards won’t be using Willson Contreras in the outfield. He still won’t catch for the foreseeable future. President of baseball operations John Mozeliak explains this and more. 
With @Ken_Rosenthal: https://t.co/nbAx3LrGmH
— Katie Woo (@katiejwoo) May 7, 2023

• May 7, 2023: Actually, no. Scratch that. Contreras won’t be playing outfield after all, says Cardinals GM John Mozeliak. Regarding Contreras’ catching, Mozeliak had this to say: “You’ve got to have confidence with people in certain roles, that’s what it comes down to. We’ll be patient, but look, again, this has not gone how we would have thought. … I do (still believe in Contreras). But some of the things we expect, some of the things about the game we’ve become accustomed to, I think he realizes it’s going to require more preparation. Now the question is, can that happen? I guess we’ll have to find out.”
• Today: Ken reports that the Cardinals tried to trade for then-A’s catcher Sean Murphy last offseason, but were unwilling to part with Oakland’s ask: Lars Nootbaar, Brendan Donovan, and a young power pitcher. “Hindsight is 20-20,” Mozeliak is quoted as saying in Ken’s article. “The types of players we thought we’d have to give up to get Murphy, we just weren’t willing to do. You might say, would you be willing to do it now? I don’t think that’s truly a fair question.”

Meanwhile, St. Louis is 11-24. What a mess. But hey, on the upside, the Cards snapped their eight-game losing streak with a 12-6 win over the Tigers on Sunday. So … there’s that.
Remember all the talk before the season started about how Red Sox closer Kenley Jansen, one of the game’s slowest-working pitchers, would struggle to adjust to the pitch clock?
Well, Jansen heard it, too. And he took exception to all those who questioned whether he could adapt.
“‘Can’t’ is not in my vocabulary,” Jansen said.
The 35-year-old has yet to be called for a pitch-clock violation, saying, “That’s the pride I’m taking in it. I’m not going to have a violation his year.” He also has been a huge part of the Red Sox’s 21-15 start, going 8-for-9 in save opportunities with a 0.84 ERA, 16 strikeouts and three walks.
His next save will be the 400th of his career. Only six other relievers have earned that many. When I interviewed Jansen for Fox on Saturday night, he spoke passionately about what the milestone will mean to him, referring back to his roots in Curaçao. His answer was edited slightly here for length and clarity.
“It means a lot,” Jansen said. “It definitely means motivation, because I ain’t done yet. I’m here (with the Red Sox) for two (years), but I plan to stay for a lot more. It’s going to be my motivation, to see how far I can reach.
“I love this game. Since I was a kid, I’ve played this game, as a catcher, six years old. (Fellow Curaçao native) Andruw Jones got to the big leagues, made us believe, paved the way for us. And here I am. The dream doesn’t stop now.”
""Andruw Jones got to the big leagues and made us believe — paved the way for us. The dream doesn't stop now.""@Ken_Rosenthal caught up with Kenley Jansen after his 399th career save tonight to secure the 8th straight win for the Red Sox. pic.twitter.com/RoMAJVwNGY

Bryce Harper wasn’t the only NL East player to return from injury earlier than expected in the last week. Orlando Arcia, just three and a half weeks after a pitch left him with a microfracture in his left wrist, returned to action over the weekend.

David O’Brien ties in the return with some insight on Braves coach Ron Washington’s work with the young infielders while the starter was out. Washington has a long track record of helping out young infielders, and hasn’t slowed down since arriving in Atlanta.
He has worked with infielders like Dansby Swanson and Ozzie Albies, and continues to do so with Vaughn Grissom and Braden Shewmake. Arcia’s return meant Grissom was sent back down to Triple-A Gwinnett.
Meanwhile, the Braves are 24-11, and their seven-game lead in the NL East is the biggest in the sport. As Jeff Schultz points out, it’s early May, but the postseason is already starting to look like a foregone conclusion.
We’ve paid a lot of attention this season to the remarkable story of Drew Maggi of the Pirates, who toiled for 13 years in the minor leagues before getting into a big-league game late last month. But across the country in Oakland, there’s a broadcaster whose journey to the big leagues was more than twice that long.
Johnny Doskow, the “56-year-old rookie,” spent 30 years calling minor-league games before finally getting his call-up this year as part of the Oakland A’s broadcast team.
With a story like this, I would usually lay out a few major points, but trust me: this story works best if you just take it in as Dan Brown wrote it. I promise it’s worth your time, and you’ll find yourself rooting for Doskow.
The Pirates are still in first place in the NL Central, but man oh man is there a difference between 20-8, which is where their record stood a week ago, and 20-15, which is where it is now after being swept by the Rays and Blue Jays. Their lead over the Brewers is down to just a half-game in the NL Central. They’ll look to snap that seven-game losing streak against the Rockies tonight.

The Rays showed no signs of letting up, winning two of three against the Yankees over the weekend. There’s now a 10-game gap between the two teams. Similar to the Yankees, the Padres were unable to pick up any ground against the Dodgers, losing two of three at home in that head-to-head matchup over the weekend. Both the Dodgers and Rays had thrilling comeback wins in extra innings to take their respective series.
And over in the AL West, the Rangers took two of three from the Angels to take a two-game lead in the division. The Rangers are 20-13, and what’s more, four of their recent losses have been come-from-ahead bullpen letdowns. It’s too early for significant trades, but it seems obvious that they’ll be hunting relief pitchers when the trade deadline gets closer.
Here are the full MLB standings.
The Liam Hendriks comeback took a big step forward; he pitched over the weekend in Triple-A Charlotte. His first outing was scoreless, and he allowed one run in his second game.
Another week, another front office member talking about his team underperforming expectations. This time it’s Guardians president of baseball operations Chris Antonetti. The Guardians are 16-18 and currently rank dead last in team OPS, at .631
The bad news in Houston is official: Luis Garcia needs Tommy John surgery, and the Astros will have to figure out how to fill those innings. They lost two of three against the Mariners over the weekend (but Jose Altuve might be closer to returning than we thought).
Speaking of Johnny Doskow, he will spend some time sliding over from radio to the TV side to fill in for Glen Kuiper, who was suspended indefinitely after uttering a racial slur on the air while mentioning the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum. Kuiper apologized on air later in the game, saying that the word “… sounded different than I meant it to be said.”

Britt Ghiroli talked to Yogi Berra’s granddaughter Lindsay about “It Ain’t Over,” a documentary about Berra’s life and legacy.
Jessica McCain has starred on reality TV shows “The Real World” and “The Challenge.” Her husband J.P. France is following in her footsteps, assuming you consider live sports to be “reality TV,” of sorts. He made his debut with the Astros over the weekend.
The Dodgers and Padres might play the first-ever MLB regular-season series in Korea next year.
Vida Blue has passed away at 73 years old.

West Virginia coach Bob Huggins twice used a homophobic slur in a radio interview Monday  when asked about whether he had recruited -- and tried to poach -- Xavier players out of the transfer portal. Huggins was being interviewed on Cincinnati radio station WLW 700-AM when hosts Bill Cunningham and Steve Moeller asked if Xavier players had popped on his radar in building out his roster via the transfer portal, and he twice resorted to using a slur while demeaning its Catholic fanbase.
""I tell ya what, any school that can throw rubber penises on the floor and then say they didn't do it? By god, they could get away with anything,"" Huggins said, according to audio obtained by Awful Announcing. (Warning: audio may be considered graphic.)
""Was this at the Crosstown Shootout?"" he was asked by the hosts. ""It was transgender night, wasn't it?""
Said Huggins: ""It was the Crosstown Shootout. Yeah, what it was, was all those f---, those Catholic f---, I think.""
The segment ended with some awkward dead air and some laughter before the hosts quipped that Huggins was ""the best.""
Huggins apologized in a statement Monday afternoon.
""Earlier today on a Cincinnati radio program, I was asked about the rivalry been my former employer, the University of Cincinnati, and its crosstown rival, Xavier University,"" Huggins said in the statement. ""During the conversation, I used a completely insensitive and abhorrent phrase that there is simply no excuse for — and I won't try to make one here. I deeply apologize to the individuals I have offended, as well as to the Xavier University community, the University of Cincinnati and West Virginia University. As I have shared with my players over my 40 years of coaching, there are consequences for our words and actions, and I will fully accept any coming my way. I am ashamed and embarrassed and heartbroken for those I have hurt. I must do better, and I will.""   
Huggins was a long-time rival of Xavier as the head coach at Cincinnati from 1989-2005 before jumping to Kansas State and then to West Virginia. With a career 935-414 overall record, Huggins has the most wins among all active coaches.  
""Coach Huggins' remarks today on a Cincinnati radio show were insensitive, offensive and do not represent our University values. Coach Huggins has since apologized,"" the university said in a statement. ""West Virginia University does not condone the use of such language and takes such actions very seriously. The situation is under review and will be addressed by the University and its athletics department.""

261,"Everything to know about the 2023 NFL schedule release date, time - Pride Of Detroit",https://www.prideofdetroit.com/2023/5/8/23715942/2023-nfl-schedule-release-date-officially-set-thursday,"Filed under:
The date and the time for the 2023 NFL schedule drop has now been officially set. 
After some speculation last week, the NFL announced officially on Monday that the 2023 NFL schedule release will happen this Thursday, on May 11. There were some concerns—via Peter King—that they may not be able to finish the schedule-making in time, but now it is official. 
The schedule is set to officially drop at 8 p.m. ET on Thursday, but there will be several leaks throughout the day. Additionally, the NFL will announce the international schedule and their new Black Friday game on Wednesday, May 10. 
Here are the full dates and places for the early leaks, via the NFL’s press release: 
There have been some rumors that the Chicago Bears—not the Detroit Lions—will head to Germany to face off against the Kansas City Chiefs, but King refuted those reports on Monday. 
“The German newspaper Bild reported KC would play Chicago in the Germany game, and that KC would play again in Germany in 2024 when Carolina is due to host a game there. Bild reported Carolina’s 2024 foe would be Kansas City. I’ve been told there’s some doubt on both of those reports,” King wrote.
In other words, keep your eyes open on Wednesday. The Lions are one of a handful of teams who could be in line to travel to Germany to face the Chiefs this year. 
We already know the Lions’ 17 opponents for the 2023 season, but the schedule release is an opportunity to see what order those games will come and how many nationally-televised games Detroit will be featured in. 
Last year, the Lions had two nationally televised games: their annual Thanksgiving game, and their Week 18 game against the Packers—which was not originally scheduled as a national game, but was flexed due to the team’s late success. In our poll from Saturday, 49 percent of you believe the Lions will get four nationally televised games this year.

263,"Boxing pound-for-pound rankings: Despite win, down goes Canelo Alvarez",https://sports.yahoo.com/boxing-pound-for-pound-rankings-despite-win-down-goes-canelo-alvarez-202802385.html,"Canelo Alvarez dominated John Ryder on Saturday in their bout for the undisputed super middleweight title near Alvarez’s hometown of Guadalajara, Mexico. Alvarez dropped Ryder once, beat him up badly and won an easy unanimous decision by scores of 118-109 twice and 120-107.
By the middle of the third round, it was a foregone conclusion that Alvarez would win.
Despite that, though, Alvarez drops two spots in the Yahoo Sports pound-for-pound rankings of the world’s 10 best boxers. He goes from fourth to sixth, with Shakur Stevenson and Gervonta Davis leapfrogging him.
Alvarez was a 20-1 favorite to win, and while he did win to improve his record to 59-2-2, it seems to me the Alvarez of only a couple of years ago would have gotten Ryder out of there and not been forced to go the distance.
It’s a fine line we’re talking here, and we’re acknowledging that Alvarez was in his first fight after surgery on his left hand. This isn’t to suggest he’s done or anywhere near close. It’s saying that he’s a tick or two worse than he was and given the talent in our Top 10, that causes him to drop.
It’s incredible to note that Alvarez is the only fighter in the Yahoo Sports Top 10 to have lost and one of only two, along with 33-0-1 WBC heavyweight champion Tyson Fury, not to have a perfect record.
This is most decidedly not overemphasizing losses. Alvarez does what I wish every fighter would do: He seeks out the best competition he can for nearly every fight. Three former Alvarez opponents, Floyd Mayweather Jr., Shane Mosley and Miguel Cotto, are already enshrined in the International Boxing Hall of Fame. Among the remainder of his opponents, Gennadiy Golovkin will almost certainly make it and Dmitry Bivol and Sergey Kovalev have a good shot.
If all three of the latter fighters make it, that means Alvarez to this point in his career has fought about 10 percent of his fights against Hall of Famers.
He didn’t look like his usual self against Ryder, though, and that will cost him two spots in our rankings.
Given that, here’s how the Top 10 shakes out:
Terence Crawford (39-0, 30 KOs), WBO welterweight champion. Previous Ranking: 1
Naoya Inoue (24-0, 21 KOs), Undisputed bantamweight champion. Previous Ranking: 2
Oleksandr Usyk (20-0, 13 KOs), IBF-WBA-WBO heavyweight champion. Previous Ranking: 3
Shakur Stevenson (19-0, 9 KOs), Lightweight contender. Previous Ranking: 5
Gervonta Davis (29-0, 27 KOs), Secondary WBA lightweight champion. Previous ranking: 6
Canelo Alvarez (58-2-2, 39 KOs), Undisputed super middleweight champion. Previous Ranking: 4
Devin Haney (29-0, 15 KOs), Undisputed lightweight champion. Previous Ranking: 7
Tyson Fury (33-0-1, 24 KOs), WBC heavyweight champion. Previous Ranking: 8
Dmitry Bivol (21-0, 11 KOs), WBA light heavyweight champion. Previous Ranking: 9
Artur Beterbiev (19-0, 19 KOs), IBF-WBC-WBO light heavyweight champion. Previous ranking: 10
The Mexican superstar outclassed his challenger in front of over 50,000 fans at Estadio Akron near Alvarez’s hometown of Guadalajara to win a unanimous decision.
Canelo looked like Canelo in his hometown of Guadalajara.
Undisputed super middleweight champion Canelo Alvarez returns to the ring Saturday against John Ryder in his first bout since he had his left hand surgically repaired.

The team noted that Yarbrough sustained ""head fractures"" but did not provide further details about his condition in Monday's announcement.
The incident took place in the top of the sixth inning of Kansas City's home game against the Oakland A's. With the Royals leading 2-1 with one out, Yarbrough threw a 3-2 sinker to A's first baseman Ryan Noda, who hit a comebacker. Yarbrough tried to duck as he completed his followthrough, but the line drive hit him on the left side of his face.

Yarbrough collapsed to the mound as catcher Salvador Perez gathered the ball to throw Noda out at first.
Fortunately, Yarbrough was able to walk off the field. He reached his feet with some assistance and walked to the Royals dugout while covering his face with a towel. Carlos Hernandez replaced him on the mound.

The extent of Yarbrough's injuries wasn't initially clear. Royals manager Matt Quataro told reporters after the game that Yarbrough was alert and responsive. He was taken to a local hospital for evaluation.
Matt Quatraro provides an update on Ryan Yarbrough: ""It was scary. I mean the dugout went silent ... luckily when we got out there he was talking and aware of what was going on ... as far as how he's doing, he's alert and they've taken him to get some testing."" #Royals pic.twitter.com/FNbYhtW3Ch

""It was scary,"" Quataro said. ""The dugout went silent, everybody. Your heart drops. You get a pit in your stomach. I can't think of a worse thing to see on the field.
""Luckily when we got out there, he was talking and aware of what was going on and what had happened. He was swollen immediately. There was some blood. You just didn't know exactly where it was coming from. As far as how he's doing, he's alert. And they've taken him to get some testing.""
The incident ended a strong day on the mound for Yarbrough, who allowed three hits and one run with no walks in 5 2/3 innings of work. He was credited with the win in the 5-1 Royals victory.
Yarbrough, 31, is in his first season as a starter for the Royals after spending his first five MLB seasons with the Tampa Bay Rays.

An NFL Draft Podcast


See who to add and drop

It's rarely discussed nowadays, but in 2007, NBA discipline effectively decided the championship. At the end of Game 4 of the second-round series between the San Antonio Spurs and Phoenix Suns, Spurs big man Robert Horry gave two-time MVP Steve Nash a dirty hip-check into the scorer's table. The Suns were livid. Not only did his teammates on the floor rush to Nash's defense, but key Suns players Amar'e Stoudemire and Boris Diaw left the bench area and attempted to make their way toward Horry. 
NBA rules expressly forbid this, though, and Stoudemire and Diaw were suspended for Game 5. San Antonio won, eventually knocked Phoenix out in six, and went on to win the championship with their most dangerous opponent eliminated on a technicality. Now, 16 years later, the NBA faces an eerily similar situation.
On Sunday, those same Suns played Game 4 of a second-round series. This time, it was against the Denver Nuggets. A two-time MVP playing for the other side, Nikola Jokic, attempted to quickly grab a ball that had gone out of bounds to initiate a fast break. The ball happened to be in the hands of Suns owner Mat Ishbia, who refused to give it to Jokic. After a brief struggle for the ball, Ishbia knocked it away from Jokic. He then put his hand on Jokic's hip, and Jokic responded with a shove. He was assessed a technical foul. The game moved on. The Nuggets lost.
But Suns fans haven't forgotten that fateful night in 2007, when the team's best chance at its first championship was taken by a quirk in the rulebook. Many now expect Jokic to be held to the same standard, and are calling for a suspension in Game 5. Will that suspension come? Well... there's not a clear answer here. So let's go through this piece by piece and attempt to figure out what the league will do about Sunday's sideshow.
NBA Rule 12A, Section Vl4 states that ""a player, coach, trainer, or other team bench person must be ejected for deliberately entering the stands other than as a continuance of play."" The stands, for the purposes of this rule, are defined as the first row of seating. Already, we have a murky situation to dissect.
Jokic did not enter the stands as a continuation of play. Doing so would mean chasing a live ball as it went out of bounds. However, he did enter the stands for basketball reasons. He did not seek out a confrontation. He was attempting to inbound the ball. Ishbia, technically a spectator, interfered with his ability to do so. The NBA does account for fan interference on live balls. See this play, for example: In 2011, Nash attempted to save a ball that was going out of bounds, but a fan interfered with it. The Suns were awarded possession. 
This was not a live ball, and possession was not in dispute, so fan interference was not called. The NBA does include delay of game penalties, and they are enforced in the following manner: ""A delay-of-game shall be called for preventing the ball from being promptly put into play, interfering with the ball after a successful field goal or free throw or failing to immediately pass the ball to the nearest official when a personal foul or violation is assessed."" These rules are meant to apply to players, however. Ishbia did prevent the ball from being promptly put into play, so he technically committed a violation. It was not called.
Obviously, Jokic was not ejected from the game. Crew chief Tony Brothers felt a technical foul was sufficient, as he explained to a pool reporter after the game. ""I just deemed the technical foul the appropriate penalty for what happened over there,"" Brothers said. ""He didn't just run over and hit a fan. There was some engagement, so I deemed the technical foul the appropriate penalty."" While he did not say this explicitly, Brothers hints at another possible reason Jokic was not ejected.
Jokic did not technically go into the stands. While the stands technically begin at the first row of seating, Ishbia was standing up and had taken a step forward onto the court. From this perspective, it could be argued that Ishbia was actually encroaching upon Jokic's space. The NBA fan code of conduct states that ""guests who engage in fighting, throwing objects or attempting to enter the court will be immediately ejected from the arena."" Ishbia didn't exactly run onto the court, but he moved forward in a way that interfered with play. A normal fan likely would have been ejected for the incident, and one fan was moved as a result. Ishbia was not ejected.
He did, however, make initial contact with Jokic. While that contact was slight, he placed a hand on Jokic's hip before Jokic shoved him. This situation is so specific that the league does not have guidelines governing it, but it could easily be argued that Jokic was acting instinctually in self-defense against a spectator who had already interfered with game play. Jokic himself argued that Ishbia should have been ejected. ""He's a fan, he's supposed to get kicked out if he's influencing the game,"" Jokic said.
With all of this in mind, either side could credibly argued that the other is the one that deserves discipline. So, what does league history say will happen?
Any precedent that we cite needs to be taken with a grain of salt. This situation, specifically, is unprecedented. The NBA takes confrontations between fans and players extremely seriously... but they are remarkably rare nowadays. The last player to be suspended for a fan interaction was Antonio Davis in 2006. The difference was that Davis actually entered the stands to confront a fan that he believed was harassing his wife. He was given a five-game suspension for that. 
The far more noteworthy example took place in 2004, during the infamous ""Malice at the Palace"" brawl in Detroit. Indiana Pacers forward Ron Artest ran into the stands to fight a fan who had thrown a beer at him. Several players were suspended, including Artest, who sat out the rest of the season. Once again, the difference between that incident and this one was enormous.
Players may not have faced recent suspensions for entering the stands, but an assistant coach did as recently as last season. Wizards assistant Mike Batiste was suspended two games for attempting to confront a fan during a home game against the Miami Heat in February 2022.

In this case, Batiste, already sitting in the second row as an assistant, moved deeper into the stands to confront a fan. He was held back by Montrezl Harrell. After the season, Batiste left the Wizards to join the Houston Rockets. However, as recently as this incident took place, it likely holds little bearing over the Jokic situation.
There is one precedent worth monitoring here, though, and it relates to Ishbia. During the 2019 NBA Finals, Golden State Warriors minority owner Mark Stevens was caught grabbing and shoving Toronto Raptors guard Kyle Lowry after he chased a loose ball out of bounds.
Stevens was ejected from the arena, banned from all Warriors facilities for one year and fined $500,000 for the incident. Yet we can still hardly treat it as a fair precedent for Ishbia, whose contact with Jokic was minimal. Ultimately, there simply isn't much of a history in the NBA of incidents like the one between Jokic and Ishbia taking place. The league, to some extent, is flying blind. That gives it a bit of leeway.
David Stern was a firm believer in following rules to the letter. The 2007 series between the Suns and Spurs was a clear example. Leaving the bench area during a fight warrants an automatic suspension, so Stern suspended Stoudemire and Diaw regardless of fan backlash. The NBA continues issuing such suspensions to this day. Jokic himself has even earned one. But consider this moment during Game 1 of the 2018 NBA Finals.
Kevin Love told me he left the bench in OT to argue the call on Tristan, walking onto the court to get in the officials' eyeline, not in reaction to any scuffle & before it even broke out. Video (via @bballbreakdown) seems to back this up; not sure if it will matter to the league pic.twitter.com/JeHmd6Fl2p
While Love explained to Rachel Nichols that he left the bench to argue a call, he did technically leave the bench during a fight. By the letter of the law, he should have been suspended. Stern likely would have suspended him. But Stern was no longer the commissioner in 2018. Adam Silver was, and Love ultimately was not suspended. Silver has typically been far more relaxed when it comes to discipline, and that is ultimately the only precedent that matters here.
In all likelihood, Jokic will not be suspended. We can point to the vagueness of the rules we've cited throughout this story as the reason why, but there's a far simpler explanation: the NBA is a business. The league wants to put out an entertaining product that fans will watch. The Suns and Nuggets are in the middle of an incredibly exciting series. The winner will have a strong chance to win the championship. It is absolutely not in the league's business interests to ruin that series by taking a two-time MVP off of the floor for a critical game.
For what it's worth, Ishbia commented on Monday morning, tweeting that he did not think Jokic should be suspended or that anyone involved should be fined.
Great win for the Suns last night in an amazing series so far! That should be and is the only story. Suspending or fining anyone over last nights incident would not be right. I have alot of respect for Jokic and don’t want to see anything like that. Excited for game 5! Go Suns!
Now, this does not mean rules will never be enforced. They exist for a reason, and when the league has no choice, it will discipline players. It has already issued two suspensions for former All-Stars this postseason: one for Draymond Green and another for Dejounte Murray. But when there is gray area, as there clearly is for Jokic, Silver tends to veer on the side of not interfering with the league's product.
So will Jokic be fined? Probably. Ishbia probably will be as well. But the odds of the NBA intentionally ruining one of the most exciting games of its season seem slim.

270,Chiefs Rookie Minicamp 2023: Retired NFL defensive end  Wyatt Hubert is trying for a comeback with his home team - Arrowhead Pride,https://www.arrowheadpride.com/2023/5/8/23715824/chiefs-rookie-minicamp-2023-retired-nfl-player-trying-for-home-team-comeback,"Filed under:
There’s another former K-State defensive end trying to land with the team he’s followed since childhood.
It's not every day that you see a drafted NFL player who missed his entire rookie season with an injury and then retired — only to come back to the game after missing a season.
But that's what happening with former Kansas State defensive end Wyatt Hubert, who was a two-time first-team All Big-12 player in Manhattan before being drafted by the Cincinnati Bengals in the seventh round (235th overall) in the 2021 NFL Draft. After suffering a torn pectoral muscle that July, he missed his entire rookie season — and then retired last August.
But over the weekend, the Kansas City Chiefs hosted Hubert for a tryout during their rookie minicamp — and after the final session on Monday, put him in front of the media.
""I was working a regular job,"" he recalled of the 2022 season, ""living a regular life. I worked probably five to six months. About the last two months, I started to think back. It was really hard to watch a football game just knowing my close friends [who] are on teams — who are playing — [while I'm] just watching a game, kind of knowing that I could do that, too.""
But he says that didn't necessarily make it an easy decision to make.
""There's a lot of things that went into it,"" he explained. ""Injuries were the main thing. I've had a lot of surgeries. A lot of times, once you're cleared, people are expecting you to be fully healthy, fully cleared — and to be pain-free once you're cleared. That's not necessarily how it works... There was just such a build-up of things — prior injuries — that just were long-lasting; [they] never went away. So it was tough.""
Hubert also knew getting back into the league wouldn't be easy. But after discussing it, he and his agent worked out a plan. After all... during Hubert's three-year career in Manhattan, he had collected 94 tackles (72 solo, 33 for loss), 20 sacks, an interception, two passes defended and three forced fumbles. Surely, there was at least one NFL team that would give him a chance.
""[My agent] went to the Combine [and] brought up my name during the whole combine process,"" said Hubert. ""He mentioned my name to a few teams. We had our fingers crossed, hoping that a few teams would give me an opportunity. Three teams did — with the Chiefs being one.""
Then it was just a matter of being in shape when he had the opportunity to try out with the interested teams. But Hubert hadn't even allowed himself to get out of shape; he had never stopped working out.
""Even though I wasn't playing football,"" he said, ""I always treated myself like an athlete — in the weight room, with my diet and everything I did. I still took all that very seriously every single day. So that definitely helped my transition back into football.""
Hubert still has two other teams — one in the AFC, one in the NFC — that want him to come in for a tryout. (He says he's been advised not to identify them). But the native of Topeka, Kansas certainly sounded like he'd prefer an opportunity to play for the Chiefs. Like the team's first-round pick Felix Anudike-Uzomah (also a former K-State defensive end), Hubert has spent his whole life as a Chiefs fan.
""It's crazy,"" he declared. ""Wearing an arrowhead on my chest is definitely special. It's like wearing a Wildcat on my chest, too. So it's crazy. [I] definitely think we'll be here.""
But first, the Chiefs will have to decide if the 6-foot-3, 270-pound Hubert (who will turn 25 before the season begins) is worth a spot on the team's 90-man offseason roster. The team's decision to put him in front of reporters on Monday is actually a pretty good sign that the team remains interested.
And however it plays out, Hubert isn't looking back.
""It was a tough decision,"" he reiterated. ""But I decided this is such a short window in my life, why not take advantage of the opportunity — and just give it my all?""

271,Christopher Morel recalled to Cubs on May 8 2023,https://www.mlb.com/news/christopher-morel-recalled-to-cubs-on-may-8-2023,"Jordan Bastian
CHICAGO -- A tarp covered Wrigley Field’s infield on Monday evening, following a cold rain that blew through the area. Christopher Morel took the field, spotted a group of security staffers, smiled wide and headed over to say hello.
“He’s always smiling. He’s always happy,” Cubs first baseman Matt Mervis said. “Greets everybody. He’s the happiest guy to be in the locker room every day. It’s impressive, really.”
And the cold wind and raindrops could not wipe that smile off Morel’s face. This was no ordinary day and these were not ordinary greetings. Morel was back in the big leagues after ripping through Triple-A pitching with Iowa over the past month-plus.
Prior to Monday’s 3-1 loss to the rival Cardinals, the Cubs recalled Morel from Iowa and optioned outfielder Nelson Velázquez to the same affiliate. How and when Morel will be worked into the mix is yet to be determined, but he had nothing left to prove in the Minors.
“He's proven that Triple-A, he's better than that league,” Cubs manager David Ross said, “and deserves a shot here.”
Morel’s presence could prove important in the immediate picture, given Nico Hoerner’s exit from Monday’s game in the fifth inning due to left hamstring tightness. Hoerner, who pulled up while running from first to third base on a Dansby Swanson double, will undergo imaging on Tuesday morning to help determine the severity of the setback.
Nick Madrigal and Morel both provide possible fill-ins for Hoerner at second base.
“It’s frustrating. He’s worked really hard to get to this moment,” Madrigal said of Hoerner. “He’s huge to this team -- the lineup, defensively, offensively, everything. So hopefully he’ll be back in there soon.”
In 29 games with the I-Cubs, the 23-year-old Morel turned in a robust .330/.425/.730 slash line. He slugged 11 homers, adding nine doubles and a pair of triples. Morel scored 31 runs and collected 31 RBIs, while bouncing between all three outfield spots and third base.
Morel said he focused on trying to make productive contact, given his issues with strikeouts. He still struck out at a 30.6 percent rate with Iowa, but balanced that with a 12.7 percent walk rate and overwhelming production on the balls he did connect on.
“Everybody knows I have a problem with my strikeouts,” Morel said. “I made adjustments. I tried to have good at-bats, make more contact, put the ball more in play. That’s what I was working on. Thank God for this. I worked on this and I made it. I’m here.”
Mervis -- who got the call to The Show on Friday after his own strong start with Iowa -- said “it was crazy to watch” Morel’s performance.
“Every at-bat was a good at-bat,” Mervis said. “Against some of the better pitchers we saw, it ended with a bullet RBI double off the big wall in left or a home run. It was always productive. Every at-bat, you just knew Morel was going to do something good.”
Only a few days ago, both Ross and Cubs president of baseball operations Jed Hoyer downplayed a potential promotion of Morel. The message was that there was not a clear path to regular at-bats, given the stable nature of Chicago’s Major League roster and lineup.
Ross was asked Monday what changed that led to Morel’s arrival. The manager explained that the decision stemmed, in part, from a desire to get Velázquez out of a bench role and back to playing every day with the I-Cubs. Beyond that, Morel’s numbers could no longer be denied.
Morel was not in the starting lineup on Monday for his first game back with the Cubs. Going forward, he can offer an option for multiple infield and outfield positions, or as the designated hitter. Ross was not certain how it would play out.
“I don't know that there's this big path for everyday at-bats,” Ross said. “[Having] some ability to mix Mo in from time to time is probably going to be the role, more than just everyday at-bats, for sure.”
Last year, Morel arrived on May 17 out of necessity for the Cubs and the rookie launched a memorable home run in his first career at-bat. He went on to hit .235/.308/.433 with 16 homers in 113 games, in which he became a fan favorite not only for his power, but for his infectious personality and energy.

That was evident again pregame on Monday, when multiple teammates lit up when they saw Morel in the clubhouse. After what could have been a demoralizing demotion to Triple-A to start the season, Morel had returned after forcing the Cubs’ hand.
“I didn’t have any problem with it,” Morel said of starting the season at Triple-A. “They sent me down to Iowa and I just remained positive. I just trusted God and trusted myself that I would go back to the big leagues soon. That was my mentality every day that I went to the stadium.”",1
273,Cal McNair says he didn't pressure Texans' pick of C.J. Stroud - ProFootballTalk,https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2023/05/08/cal-mcnair-says-he-didnt-pressure-texans-pick-of-c-j-stroud/,"



The Texans drafted C.J. Stroud with the second overall pick, a surprise to many who were convinced the team would pass on a quarterback after missing out on Bryce Young.Texans owner Cal McNair insisted Monday that neither he nor his wife, Hannah, forced the selection of the Ohio State quarterback.“Hannah and I don’t make the picks. We’ll make it clear there,” McNair said during the Houston Texans Charity Golf Classic, via DJ Bien-Aime of ESPN. “We have a great group of scouts led by Nick [Caserio] and James Lippert, and they did a lot of work on the draft board, and then they followed that on draft day, and they moved up when they saw the value was there and moved back.”The Texans picked Stroud at No. 2 and then traded up to No. 3 in a deal with the Cardinals to take Alabama defensive end Will Anderson Jr. Despite outside uncertainty about what the team was doing with the second pick, the Texans repeatedly have said they never wavered on the choice. They now have who they hope is their franchise quarterback.They thought they had that with Deshaun Watson until the relationship between player and team soured, and then Watson became embroiled in a series of civil suits for sexual misconduct.A year after trading Watson — and more than two years since he played his final game for the Texans — Houston has who they hope is his long-term replacement.The Texans have a much improved roster from the past two seasons when they went 11-38-1 with two different head coaches. They will have their third head coach in three years and expect to see progress this season under DeMeco Ryans.“I think you just have to look at the roster, and I think it’s a better roster this year, very competitive,” McNair said. “They want to have competition spots on the roster. So, I see a lot of progress. A lot of good things.”

I don’t understand why people think people outside the organization should know who the pick is going to be. There’s no incentive for those in the know to share that information. Stroud was always going to be a top-2 pick, and then all of a sudden mock drafters started saying the Texans wouldn’t draft a QB at 2. Now we’re so surprised by it that we think the owner must have stepped in to demand they pick a guy they didn’t want. There’s too much speculation presented as analysis or inside information and people believe it every year.
Let’s hope this works out. Texans are in danger of matching the Oilers in the 90’s in terms of fan apathy. We all know how that ended.
After the draft and free agency, the Texans roster is greatly improved. They still have a long way to go,  but they’ll be better next season. Stroud may or may not be the guy, but I’d give good odds that Anderson will work out. Roll the dice on the QB and see what happens.
Cardinals banking on Texans to be the same ol Texans and have another bad season. Potentially giving them 2 top 10 picks in 2024 draft. Because we all know Cardinals will be bad next year too
Nobody believes you, Cal.
Riiiggghhht. We believe you Cal. The only question I have is will you allow this HC to coach more than one season.
I’m all in on the 2023 Texans Draft.
The Owner and General Manager did everything in their power to draft the players
that were selected and/or requested by DeMico Ryans and his staff.
This is a new era for the Houston Texans and now DeMico Ryans is driving the bus.
Everything in the Texans organization now appears to be working in the same direction.

34 
For the past few seasons, some rival executives in the National League Central have grumbled about the St. Louis Cardinals. The criticism hit on familiar themes. The Cardinals don’t have enough pitching. They don’t miss enough bats. They’re going to get exposed. 
The chorus proved accurate only to an extent. In 2021, the Cardinals pitching staff ranked 30th in strikeouts per nine innings. The team still won 90 games and made the postseason. In 2022, the Cardinals again finished last in strikeout rate. Again, the team still won 93 games and the National League Central.

In 2023, heading into Sunday’s games, the Cardinals ranked ninth in the majors in strikeouts per nine, at 9.25, a notable improvement from the previous two seasons. So how, exactly, did St. Louis become the worst team in the National League through the first six weeks of the year?
An alarm sounded at Busch Stadium on Saturday morning, hours before the Cardinals lost their ninth game in a row. Manager Oli Marmol announced that catcher Willson Contreras, the team’s $87.5 million offseason prize, would no longer be the starting catcher. He would shift to designated hitter. This story from Katie Woo investigated all of the subsequent roster complications created by the decision.
Marmol stressed that Contreras should not be scapegoated for the downturn. “One thing I want to make super clear is that we are not losing ballgames because of Willson Contreras,” Marmol insisted. Fair enough. The Cardinals are not losing games just because of Contreras. The Cardinals are losing games because they have been, stunningly, one of the worst fundamental teams in the sport.
Their pitchers struggle to finish at-bats with two strikes. The once-vaunted defense looks less capable. The runners commit mistakes on the bases. And to add disappointment to the disarray, third baseman Nolan Arenado, one of the offense’s two pillars, has gotten off to the worst start of his career. To be clear, the Cardinals aren’t just doing the little things poorly. The starting rotation entered Sunday with a collective 5.44 ERA. But a team that once played clean baseball to paper over its deficiencies has done the opposite in 2023.
Up two runs in the top of Saturday’s sixth inning against Detroit, Adam Wainwright picked up a pair of strikes on Tigers infielder Nick Maton. Wainwright had missed the first month of the season with a groin injury. In his 2023 debut, he found a way to fit in with his fellow pitchers. He left a cutter over the plate. Maton doubled and came around to score. The two-strike woes have plagued the entire staff. St. Louis entered Sunday with opponents posting a .651 OPS with two strikes, the second-worst mark in baseball. Only Oakland was less effective at putting hitters away. (The Blue Jays ranked first with a .401 OPS against in those spots.)

A leadoff double with two strikes is bad. What happened on Sunday, in the sixth inning against Detroit, was even worse. Jojo Romero, a reliever who had given up one run in his first five appearances this season, ran the count full against catcher Jake Rogers. Romero slopped a sinker at the waist. Rogers deposited the pitch beyond the left-center fence for a grand slam to give Detroit the lead.

In the fifth inning on Saturday, with a runner at third base and one out, Tigers utility man Zack McKinstry lofted a ball into right field. Second baseman Brendan Donovan gave chase as outfielder Lars Nootbaar approached. Neither man could call the other off. Donovan caught it while colliding with Nootbaar. Donovan spun around to throw while Nootbaar tumbled to the grass. The run scored. Nootbaar may not have been able to make the play. But the mixup underscored the general defensive inefficiency of St. Louis’s run-prevention machine.
In 2021, the group ranked second in defensive runs saved, according to FanGraphs. The unit finished third in 2022. Thus far, the Cardinals defense has cost more runs than it has prevented, according to those metrics. Defensive statistics are notably wonky, especially in small sample sizes. But the trend has not been encouraging.
At a time when the new rules are encouraging more teams to jet around the bases, the Cardinals can’t get out of their own way. Only the Reds had made more outs on the bases heading into Sunday’s games. St. Louis ranked 28th in Baseball-Reference’s tabulation of bases taken on fly balls, passed balls, wild pitches, balks and defensive indifference.
It may be unfair to single out individuals, given the collective struggles. But St. Louis constructed its offense around Arenado and Paul Goldschmidt. Thus far, Goldschmidt has been himself; his 150 OPS+ heading into Sunday was just above his career average — and that was before hitting three homers as the Cardinals ended the losing streak against Detroit. Even after homering on Saturday, Arenado was lugging around a 76 OPS+ and a .630 OPS.
Advertisement
Consider his OPS as of May 7 in his other seasons:
2022: 1.071
2021: .837
2019: .919
2018: 1.021
2017: .938
2016: 1.044
2015: .906
2014: .882
Even in 2013, when he debuted in the majors in late April, his OPS through his first 32 games was .675. Arenado is an excellent player with a decade of success in the majors. He should be fine. The same may not be true of his team. The Contreras decision added to a month of curious personnel moves, from the demotion of top prospect Jordan Walker to the switcheroo with pitcher Zack Thompson. Tyler O’Neill engaged in a spat about hustle with Marmol. Jack Flaherty has a 6.29 ERA. It is a bad time.
In years past, the Cardinals played enough crisp, clean baseball to obscure problems with the roster. Their pitchers did not miss enough bats in those days. St. Louis still did enough to win. In 2023, in a hellish opening to the season, every weakness looks that much more glaring.
The ongoing spiral in St. Louis is just one takeaway from the week that was in baseball. Here are four others.
Billy Eppler worked beside Brian Cashman in the Yankees front office for a decade. The influence of the latter on the former was significant. So it was that, a few days after Cashman met with the press to answer for the sluggish start of the Yankees, Eppler showed up to take similar medicine in Queens.
“Don’t count us out,” the Yankees general manager said.
“I believe in this roster,” the Mets general manager said.
“This is a championship-caliber operation,” Cashman said.
“It’s a club with a lot of experience,” Eppler said. “It’s a club with a lot of know-how.”
The similarity of the messages made sense. The two New York teams have been mediocre thus far for similar reasons. Both clubs have been hampered by injuries. The Yankees have been wrecked in a variety of ways, with Aaron Judge, Giancarlo Stanton, Carlos Rodón and Luis Severino all sidelined. The Mets lost all-world closer Edwin Díaz in the World Baseball Classic. Justin Verlander missed the first month. Carlos Carrasco and Omar Narvaez are on the shelf. Jose Quintana has yet to throw a pitch as a Met.

And both clubs should, in the eyes of several executives polled this week, be OK. At least, in terms of qualifying for the expanded playoffs. Despite the understandable protestations of their fan base about October failures, the Yankees have an organizational DNA geared toward winning, with six consecutive postseason appearances — in addition to a run-prevention machine that should keep the club afloat. And the Mets still sport an enviable core of position players — Pete Alonso, Francisco Lindor, Jeff McNeil and Brandon Nimmo — that should sustain the offense during the summer.
Note: I said “should” be OK. It is too early to write off the division, but both versions of the East contain clubs off to hot starts. The Rays and the Braves look like the two best teams in the sport. The Braves lead the East by seven games after the Mets’ pitching combusted on Sunday against Colorado. The Rays have a 10-game lead over the Yankees after Gerrit Cole blew a six-run lead in an 8-7 defeat at Tropicana Field. And the Yankees, it must be noted, reside in last place in the East, now that Boston has woken up.
So Cashman and Eppler can hit the same notes for the same reasons. They can believe in the track records of their teams with the same confidence. And their fans still have a right to worry — this is not the start either New York club envisioned.
The Pittsburgh Pirates have spent the last three Sundays in first place. But first place doesn’t always feel the same. On April 23, the team was 16-7. On April 30, the team was 20-9. On this most recent Sunday, the team was . . . still stuck on 20 victories, now with 15 defeats attached. The Buccos have lost seven in a row.
The balanced schedule may benefit teams from the American League East, who have grown tired of beating up on each other over the years. It will likely be less kind to teams in the two Central divisions, where the competition is less fierce. The Pirates suffered during a recent stretch against Tampa Bay and Toronto.
Tampa Bay limited Pittsburgh to four runs in three days. Toronto outscored the Pirates, 22-3, in another sweep this weekend. Regression for the Pirates is far from shocking — the roster featured several players producing above their career norms in April. But the club has maintained its hold on first place because Milwaukee is suffering through a similar skid.
A good rule of thumb is to never consider an offseason decision vindicated by May. The Red Sox, of course, would be a better baseball team if they still employed shortstop Xander Bogaerts, who has continued to bash baseballs despite relocating to the West Coast. But it is at least worth noting that a sketch of chief baseball officer Chaim Bloom’s vision for the club has become apparent across a recent eight-game winning streak.
The Red Sox chewed up opposing pitchers from Cleveland, Toronto and Philadelphia along the way. Masataka Yoshida has demonstrated his power. The in-place trio of Rafael Devers, Jarren Duran and Alex Verdugo has been excellent. The lineup entered Sunday ranked second in the sport in on-base percentage and third in slugging percentage. The group has tormented pitchers despite slow starts from Kiké Hernandez and Justin Turner, plus losing Adam Duvall to a broken wrist.
Advertisement
Boston may not have the pitching to maintain a postseason pace. But the offense could keep them afloat for much of the summer. It makes it easier to understand what Bloom was talking about when he remarked, during the winter, “We’re going to do this. It’s going to be awesome.”
Part of the calculus in Houston’s decision to let Verlander leave this past winter was faith in the organization’s depth. For the past few years, the Astros had juggled seven or eight legitimate big-league starters on their roster. They might be unable to replace Verlander’s exact production. But the thinking was that the team had enough arms to solve the problem.
The past few weeks have made that notion look inaccurate. With Luis Garcia undergoing season-ending Tommy John surgery, Houston will need a healthy return from Lance McCullers Jr., who has yet to pitch this season as he recovers from an elbow strain. McCullers just began throwing bullpen sessions. The injury to Garcia came only days after fellow starter Jose Urquidy was shut down with discomfort in his shoulder.
There are fewer internal options than in years past. The team had already graduated top prospect Hunter Brown to the majors. Brown was the only member of the Astros organization to land in Keith Law’s top 100 list before the season. Law described the farm system as “badly depleted from years of trades and lost draft picks,” a reality that may cost the club in 2023.

276,"Cubs Lineup - Cubs vs Cardinals: Pitching Matchup, Broadcast Info",https://www.bleachernation.com/cubs/2023/05/08/cubs-vs-cardinals-lineups-pitching-matchup-broadcast-info-game-thread/,"Well, we all did it! After weeks of complaining in the comment section and on Twitter, Cubs President Jed Hoyer is handing out big league promotions like candy on Halloween. Chris Morel is the latest prospect to arrive in Chicago, but he’s NOT in the Chicago Cubs lineup for Game 1 against St. Louis tonight. Lol. Classic. 
Instead, the Cubs lineup this afternoon features Patrick Wisdom at third base, Trey Mancini at DH, and the usual three suspects across the outfield (which I share as likely the easiest potential paths to playing time for Morel). I suspect Morel will get his time to shine — Jed Hoyer said they didn’t want to call him up until he would start most games — but that time is not tonight. He’ll be available off the bench. 
Also absent from tonight’s Cubs lineup? Miguel Amaya. Tucker Barnhart gets another go at it, despite catching the latter half of yesterday’s marathon game. Shrug. Would I like to see the maximum amount of Amaya? Yeah. But he’s already being tasked with a lot, coming up straight from Double-A as a catcher after barely catching any games these last few years. Going with the veteran behind the plate more often than not right now just isn’t giving me much heartache on a game-to-game basis. WITH THAT SAID, I believe Yan Gomes is eligible to return tomorrow, so this may have been his last shot (for now). 
Chicago Cubs: Marcus Stroman, RHP
Marcus Stroman sure didn’t let that tough outing against the Dodgers get to him, eh? In two games since that blowup, he’s allowed just 3 earned runs total over 12.1 IP. The elevated strikeout numbers from the beginning of the season have started to slow down, but he still isn’t allowing any barrels, like … at all (just two all season and both in that Dodgers game!). And that’s no small feat, because after today he could rank as high as second in terms of innings pitched this season. That said, the Cardinals lineup is still a tough one, and they currently rank among the top-10 teams in wRC+ against right-handed pitching. 
Notable Matchups:
St. Louis Cardinals: Miles Mikolas, RHP
Not unlike his pal Adam Wainwright, Miles Mikolas has been a thorn in the Cubs side for a good long while (2.16 ERA over 16 career starts vs CHC). Then again, he’s just been good in general, including last season, when he earned a 3.29 ERA over 32 starts and 202.1 IP. 
How does he do it?
Historically, Mikolas doesn’t walk anybody, he gets plenty of ground balls, and he’s able to manage contact moderately well. But this season hasn’t quite gone according to plan just yet. Through seven 2023 starts, Mikolas has given up 24 earned runs, having already allowed 7 homers. And it seems like he deserves it, as his average exit velocity allowed, his average launch angle, and his barrel rate are all way up. All of that has led to a 5.79 ERA over 37.1 IP. Hopefully, the Cubs lineup can take full advantage. They certainly have plenty of history against him. Oh, and I guess we’ll see how he bounces back not throwing to Willson Contreras.

278,"Ross Chastain, Noah Gragson Fight After NASCAR Cup Series Race",https://jalopnik.com/ross-chastain-noah-gragson-nascar-cup-kansas-2023-1850415488,"Yesterday’s AdventHealth 400 at Kansas Speedway went down to a last-lap duel between Denny Hamlin and Kyle Larson. Hamlin tapped Larson’s rear bumper to put him in the backstretch wall and take his first NASCAR Cup Series victory of the season. However, the race’s dramatic conclusion was overshadowed by a fight on pit road between Trackhouse Racing driver Ross Chastain and Legacy Motor Club’s Noah Gragson.
During the race, Gragson was running side-by-side with Chastain through turn 4 and was forced up into the wall. The Legacy Motor Club driver would immediately door Chastain’s N0. 1 Camaro as the pair continued down the frontstretch.  Chastain finished fifth, and Gragson crossed the finish line five laps behind in 29th. Gragson’s frustration wouldn’t go away after the race ended, and he confronted the Trackhouse driver on pit road.
 The conversation went south quickly as Gragson grabbed Chastain by the firesuit. Chastain tried to back out of the confrontation while warning Gragson to stop. After Gragson shouted, “What the fuck is your fucking problem?”, the watermelon farmer thew a right cross into Gragson’s jaw. Onlookers quickly intervened to pull Gragson away as Chastain smirked. 
After the fight, both drivers gave their two cents to Fox Sports about what happened out on track. Chastain said:
“I got tight off of [turn] four, for sure. Noah and I have a very similar attitude on the racetrack and we train together, we prepare together, we know every little bit about each other. I definitely crowded him up off of four, and he took a swipe at us in three, and then came down and grabbed a hold of me. A very big man once told me we have a no-push policy here at Trackhouse.”
Gragson said:
“Just got fenced by the No. 1. He took care of us at Talladega. We’re Chevrolet teammates and he didn’t work with us there. And then fenced us here and I’m just over it. Nobody else has the balls to at least confront him, so if you don’t at least just grab him and do something, he’s just going to keep doing it, and I’m over it. It’s the second time.”
Somewhere that's greenGet started on your veggie planting with this 8'x4'x1' garden bed.
 Chastain has endeared himself to NASCAR fans with his watermelon-smashing victory celebration and last year’s desperation “Hail Melon!” wall-ride maneuver. Though, the watermelon farmer continues to rub many of his competitors the wrong way with his aggressive and occasionally reckless driving style. ",1
279,Colts Investigating Potential Tampering Over Commanders' Andrew Luck Inquiry,https://www.profootballrumors.com/2023/05/colts-investigating-potential-tampering-over-commanders-andrew-luck-inquiry,"9:47pm: Washington is not believed to have contacted Luck, his father (former NFL quarterback Oliver Luck) or his uncle, who has served an agent figure, according to Mark Maske and Nicki Jhabvala of the Washington Post. The Colts are seeking to confirm if an inquiry emerged through an intermediary. Despite the report of the Commanders contacting Luck emerging a year ago, Irsay appears to be pursuing this in earnest now.
12:46pm: The Commanders are firmly committed to Sam Howell as their starting quarterback in 2023, but they faced a pressing need at the position last offseason. That ultimately led the team to make an interesting – and perhaps controversial – inquiry. 
Washington made a wide-ranging effort to secure a veteran signal-caller in 2022, and that included talks with the Colts over two quarterbacks. One was Carson Wentz – whom the Commanders ultimately acquired via trade – and the other was Andrew Luck. Conversations concerning the latter were very brief and didn’t make a difference with respect to his lack of a playing future, but they re-surfaced recently and caught the attention of the Colts.
ESPN’s John Keim – who detailed the Luck-centered discussions last March – referenced those talks this past weekend in a piece detailing the Commanders’ confidence in Howell, their 2022 fifth-rounder. The specifics regarding Luck inquiries could reveal whether or not tampering occurred, something Colts owner Jim Irsay acknowledged in response to the Washington news coming up again.
“If any NFL Team attempted to contact Andrew Luck [or any associate of him]… to play for their Franchise,” Irsay wrote, ” it would be a clear Violation of the League’s Tampering Policy” (Twitter link).
Luck has been retired since 2019, but three years remained on his contract when he made the surprising decision to walk away from the game. The 33-year-old’s pact tolled, and as a result the Colts still hold his rights, as detailed by Keim’s colleague Stephen Holder. Indianapolis would thus need to be made aware of any attempts made by other teams to lure him out of retirement, though that remains all but certain not to happen. Luck is focused on his post-football life and is not eyeing a return to playing.
Holder adds that the Colts are currently “unclear about the nature of the conversations” Washington had regarding Luck, and are “seeking to learn more about what exactly transpired and whether any tampering occurred.” While that takes place, Washington will continue to move forward with Howell in place as Wentz’s successor, after the team made the expected move of releasing the latter following a disappointing one-and-done campaign in the nation’s capital.
Interestingly, Keim notes that Washington would have considered selecting Hendon Hooker in this year’s draft had he still been available by their third-round pick. That wasn’t the case, so the Commanders remain set with Howell and veteran backup Jacoby Brissett as their top two signal-callers. It will be interesting to monitor what developments, if any, take place after the Colts’ investigation into their Luck inquiries is completed.
So he sits since 2019 and Irsay wants to play the tampering card? Really… someone is hard up for attention
It’s more so stupidity from Washington to even risk it for Luck, than anything. He’s been out of football for years now, he’s clearly done. Who even knows what his play would look like at this point. They might as well try to reunite Kuechly with Ron Rivera, too.
Their defense could look even better with Patrick Willis and Chris Borland too
Luck who retired after 2018 season and was signed through 2021 could’ve signed with any team last offseason had he been interested.   There’s no tampering what Irsay is alluding too
No, the Colts still have Luck’s contract rights. At least until now, since they just took Richardson, they would’ve wanted Luck to play for them if he came back. If he was thinking about coming back, they wouldn’t want another team messing around trying to sway him to them and cut a deal for him to force his way out of Indy.
It is pretty ridiculous, but it may be correct. When players retire, they are put on a “reserve/retired” list. The contract is held in place with the amount of time remaining on it. If the player decided to unretire, he would still be under that contract. In the meantime, the team still holds his rights as an asset. It sounds similar to what NBA teams do with draft rights. The NFL does it with rights to coaches. That’s why the Broncos had to give up a pick to sign Sean Payton who had been away from the Saints for over a year.
The one difference here is that it’s possible Luck’s name came up in passing in discussions between the GMs or their staffs while they were discussing the Carson Wentz trade without it going back to Irsay because it was known to be a moot point. If that’s what happened in 2022, there was no tampering. The issue is being rehashed now, so Irsay is trying to make an issue of it.
His contract is frozen.so colts still have 3 years of control.
This is stupid on both fronts. Stupid for Washington to reach out thinking they were the juicy situation to lure Luck from a 3 year retirement, especially stupid doing it without contacting the colts first knowing that’s tampering, and also stupid for Irsay to get his feathers ruffled over such a nothing situation.
It’s unclear what happened. It’s possible his name was thrown around between the GMs during the Wentz trade negotiations, but the idea was quickly dismissed without it going back to Irsay.
Irsay: “I once had a girlfriend in college and I’d be very upset if someone inquired about her availability”.
Colts and Commanders deserve one another.
Colts just draft a QB #4 overall and still can’t let go of the Luck era.
It’s not about letting go of Luck. It’s about protecting their rights to a player who never completed his contract.
The Washington Redskins would try to tap up Andrew Luck? Why not bring Rex Grossman out of mothballs?
Luck was one of the last overpaid rookies.  Who can blame him for bowing out after earning $100+ million?   Doesn’t everyone want to win the lottery?
Luck has paid for his contract with screws throughout his body. The guy is the bionic man at this point.
Irsay has had a bee up his bonnet about Dan Snyder since the team was up for sale so this will be another attempt to make things hard for Dan. While all Washington fans would like their pound of flesh, this is a nothing-burger. In fact, Irsay has more to answer regarding his own team, hiring decisions, etc.
Irsay has had a bee up his bonnet about Dan Snyder since the team was up for sale so this will be another attempt to make things hard for Dan. While all Washington fans would like their pound of flesh, this is a nothing-burger, as Luck’s camp has come out and said no contact as been made. In fact, Irsay has more to answer regarding his own team, hiring decisions, etc.
So the Colts fleece the Redskins for Carson Wentz and Irsay is still going to complain? There’s two owners who really need to be kicked out of the NFL. Jim Irsay is one, and the other is Cal McNair. Both meddle, both are troublemakers. Lots more bad press and broken rules ahead as long as these jerks control the Colts and the Texans.
Jim Irsay and Cal McNair are “troublemakers”? The Haslams ran a diesel fuel rebate scam in their truck stop empire. Daniel Snyder enshrined a corporate culture of greed and misogyny. Stephen Ross tapped up Tom Brady to the point of nearly getting thrown out of the league.
Think like a rational citizen, not like a dumb sports fan!
Robert Kraft had a memorable time down in Florida, but luckily for him his buddies in the NFL office swept that under the rug as well.

282,Four problems we saw from the Sounders’ frustrating loss to SKC - Sounder At Heart,https://www.sounderatheart.com/2023/5/8/23715174/four-problems-we-saw-from-the-sounders-frustrating-loss-to-skc,"Filed under:
Missing Cristian, too many changes, and more.
Any result can happen at just about any time in Major League Soccer and the Seattle Sounders were victims of that reality on Sunday when they lost 2-1 to Sporting Kansas City. Heading into the weekend, the Sounders were 17 points ahead of SKC. Seattle still ended the weekend in first place in the Western Conference, but here are four things that concerned us from the performance.
Due to injury and suspension, the Sounders had to heavily rotate on Sunday against SKC. There was logic and reason to just about every change Seattle made, but on the whole it all looked too clunky and flat. The setup was basically the same; a 3-5-2 in possession while defending in a 4-4-2. But because of who was where, everything just didn’t work. Nico Lodeiro had work tirelessly to get from his defensive duties on the wing to being the focal point in attack. Héber was often caught between two stools, not really sure of his duties. Alex Roldán started at LB at was very lucky to not be sent off in the first 15 minutes. 
The Sounders came out in the second half with players in their more natural positions but that was too little too late to mount a comeback. 
Two weeks ago today the Sounders felt like they had a bit of a logjam in the central areas of their roster, so they loaned Danny Leyva to the Colorado Rapids for the remainder of the MLS season. Yesterday, Seattle was without João Paulo and Josh Atencio, which meant they had to start Obed Vargas alongside Albert Rusnák. Vargas and Rusnák are obviously talented players, but their skillsets and approaches to the game do not complement each other — or at least didn’t on Sunday. Neither of these midfielders are comfortable being the deepest central midfielder and it showed. 
The Sounders started this season with a 453-minute home shutout streak. That was ended on Sunday when SKC was able to easily break down the Sounders for their first goal in the 4th minute of the match. The team and coaching staff have talked about wanting to make Lumen Field a “Fortress” again, and they’d done well to have five straight clean sheets at home. But it was the ease with which SKC was able to repeatedly break in behind the backline that gave me a cause for concern. 
A fortress isn’t destroyed in a day, but taking a tough “L” to the worst team in the league at home isn’t good any way you slice it. It can be fuel for the fire and I fully expect this team to respond well. 
There’s no question that the Sounders have a stacked roster when everyone is fully fit. But we’re 11 games into the season and the squad isn’t close to fully fit. The cause for most concern is probably surrounding Cristian Roldan, who has missed the last few weeks with a concussion with no timeline for a return. Obviously, the primary concern is around Cristian’s long-term health and any sporting concerns are firmly secondary.
With that said, there’s a big hole on the right side of the Sounders' attack and defense. With the timeline of Cristian’s return unclear, there’s not much Seattle can do at the moment in ways of a replacement. Some sort of winger should be the target in the Summer transfer window even if Cristian returns to full health relatively quickly. In the meantime, I’d be having Ethan Dobbelaere studying film of Cristian’s role.

283,Westminster Dog Show 2023: How to watch | CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/08/us/westminster-dog-show-2023-how-to-watch-cec/index.html,"
      Thousands of dogs have descended upon New York City for what may be the most eventful week of their lives – or, at least, their humans’ lives. 
  

      The dogs, among the most beautiful and well-behaved in the country, have trained for this day for months or years. They’ve come to compete in the canine equivalent of the Olympics or the Oscars. 
  

      It’s the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show.
  

      Westminster is where the best of the best compete to earn their place in the annals of animal history. There are obedient border collies and peppy Chihuahuas, springy greyhounds and meticulously groomed Bichon Frisés. The human handlers are perhaps more nervous than their canine charges. Judges painstakingly examine each best-in-show hopeful from snout to tail. The pups, meanwhile, receive plenty of treats regardless of whether they come out on top. 
  

      Below, find a crash course on the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, including how you can watch the pups compete. 
  

      Widely considered the most prestigious of all professional dog shows in the US, the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show’s pedigree is proven: Since 1877, dogs of all stripes have vied for the title of best in show. It’s the second-longest continuously held sporting event in the country, after the Kentucky Derby, and it even predates the creation of the American Kennel Club, which wasn’t founded until 1884. 
  

      More than 3,000 dogs from 210 breeds were expected in Queens, New York, this week to strut their stuff at Westminster. 
  

      The canine competitors are divided into groups: Toy (think puffy Pomeranians and bug-eyed pugs), sporting (golden retrievers and Labrador retrievers), hound (beagles and bassets), terrier (Scotties and miniature schnauzers), working (hulking huskies and massive mastiffs) and non-sporting (your French bulldogs and poodles, who are more suited for the couch than the hunt). 
  

In photos: The 146th Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show


      First, dogs must prove they’re the best of their breed: They’re evaluated against American Kennel Club standards for their breed, as they stand for inspection and trot before a sharply dressed judge. The finest representatives of each breed move onto the group judging round. They’ll compete against the other breeds in their group to move onto the final round, during which the final seven dogs representing the best of each group will compete for the top prize.
  

      It’s difficult to pick out a frontrunner when so many of the breed winners haven’t been decided, but one competitor is entering with a sizable fanbase: Winston the French bulldog. The non-sporting sweetheart won the National Dog Show last year and best in show reserve (or runner-up) at Westminster in 2022. Winston returns to Westminster with high expectations and a low center of gravity.
  

      This year will also see the debut of the Bracco Italiano, a droopy-faced sporting dog newly recognized by the American Kennel Club. 
  

      Last year, Trumpet the bleary-eyed bloodhound ran away with best in show, the first bloodhound to earn the title. In 2021, a charmingly coiffed Pekingese named Wasabi won the title, the second Pekingese in a decade to come out on top at Westminster. The wire fox terrier has also won best in show twice in the last decade – King in 2019 and Sky in 2014 (the latter dog also won the National Dog Show in 2012 – this is a breed hungry for glory). 
  

      Winning pups have gone on to become therapy dogs, appear on Broadway and retire at the home of Martha Stewart.
  

      Breed judging is streaming live on the Westminster Kennel Club’s website Monday and Tuesday from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. ET. The channel FS2 will broadcast highlights from breed judging throughout the day, though group judging – and the coveted best-in-show crowning – can be seen only on FS1 from 7:30 p.m. to 11 p.m. ET on Tuesday.

285,Series Preview: Seattle Mariners vs. Texas Rangers - Lookout Landing,https://www.lookoutlanding.com/2023/5/8/23715670/series-preview-seattle-mariners-vs-texas-rangers-may-2023,"Filed under:
The Mariners play host to the division-leading Rangers this week.
Not much says “get right” like a series win at home against the Astros in front of an invigorating crowd. When that series brings you back to .500 on the season and even with said Astros in your division, well, that’s enough to fuel a Monday morning grin. This week the M’s have an opportunity to gain more ground as they face the division-leading Rangers. That said, even without several key players, Texas is a formidable opponent; the bats are red hot, the pitching is solid even without their injured ace, and the Mariners will need a strong showing to match them.
After going 68-94 in 2022, the Rangers went all in again last winter and it’s paying off so far. Texas leads the AL West with a 20-13 record, ranking second in the majors in team WRC+ (122) and runs scored (221). Just this weekend, they outscored the Angels 30 to 14. On the pitching side, they’re 8th in pitching fWAR and 7th in team FIP (your Mariners lead the majors in both of those categories). Ace Jacob deGrom went to the IL on April 28th with left elbow inflammation; his timeline for returning to the rotation is unclear. That’s certainly a major loss for the Rangers, though the rotation behind deGrom ranges from very good to fine and are all winning games with the run support they’ve been getting. Texas is also missing shortstop Corey Seager until mid-May (hamstring strain), catcher Mitch Garver until late May (knee sprain), and several other pitchers including Jake Odorizzi, whose season is done after shoulder surgery.
After six losing seasons, the Rangers spent big on bats going into 2022 and focused on their rotation this year. deGrom was the biggest acquisition, signing a 5-year, $185m deal, but with the additions of Nathan Eovaldi and Andrew Heaney and one more year of Martín Pérez, the whole 1-5 improved dramatically over 2022. One of the biggest questions for the Rangers this year is the health of said rotation – it remains to be seen if deGrom’s current injury is the first crack in the facade or just a blip on the radar. Either way, the Mariners’ best bath forward this series looks to be working those long at-bats to get to Texas’ decidedly less daunting bullpen.
Every starter in the Rangers lineup is performing above league average, ranging from DH/left fielder Robbie Grossman’s 91 wRC+ to catcher Jonah Heim’s 161. The Rangers have a star-studded infield of Marcus Semien, Corey Seager, Josh Jung, and Nathaniel Lowe. In Seager’s absence, Ezequiel Duran has slotted in as interim shortstop and has played himself into a spot on the roster even when Seager returns. Top prospect Jung showed off his power when he debuted last September, and has continued to do so this year – he leads the team with 8 home runs and boasts a 120 wRC+. His vices also remain consistent, with a sky-high strikeout rate of 31.6%. The Rangers outfield is made up of the consistently powerful Adolis Garcia, as well as Travis Jankowski and Leody Taveras, who are both having starting the season hot and overperforming expectations.
Updated Stuff+ Explainer 
Jon Gray enjoyed a successful, if injury-marred, first season in Texas last year after signing a four-year free agent deal last offseason. He turned his already good slider into a sweeper and improved its effectiveness outside of the thin air of Coors Field. With his fastball/sweeper combo forming the majority of his pitch mix, he struggled with a pretty significant platoon split. He doesn’t really have a third offering to keep left-handed batters at bay, though he’s tried to improve his changeup over the years. That platoon split is even larger this year and his strikeout rate has cratered to just 14.5% in six starts.
Andrew Heaney was one of the other big additions to the Rangers starting rotation behind deGrom this offseason. He posted the highest strikeout rate and second lowest walk rate of his career last year, fueled by the highest fastball velocity of his career. He also took his slurvy curveball and turned it into a more traditional slider with a four mile per hour jump in velocity. A recurring shoulder injury derailed any shot of him putting together a full breakout season. This year, his velocity has taken a step back across the board and his strikeout rate has fallen back towards his career norms. Paired with a huge jump in walk rate, his FIP has ballooned to over six.
With deGrom on the shelf for the foreseeable future, the Rangers have turned to Dane Dunning to fill his spot in the rotation. He’s been a serviceable back-end starter for Texas over the last two years, with a penchant for inducing weak contact on the ground. Without a strong strikeout-to-walk ratio, his ceiling is rather limited and none of his pitches standout as a potential path to improvement. This year, his 1.42 ERA is seemingly driven by some really lucky results on balls in play, with a .187 BABIP.
Not much has changed in the AL West standings recently, other than the M’s drawing even with the Astros. The Rangers took two of three from the Angels, while the A’s managed to do the same against the Royals. As the Angels and Mariners swap opponents, with Houston headed to LA, be on standby for shifts in the divisional standings. Oakland, meanwhile, heads to New York to play the Yankees, last in the mighty AL East despite their winning record.

287,NHL draft lottery odds 2023: Here's what you need to know,https://www.freep.com/story/sports/nhl/red-wings/2023/05/08/nhl-draft-lottery-odds-2023-results-tv-channel-start-time-connor-bedard/70194194007/,"The Detroit Red Wings soon will know where they make the next most important pick in their rebuild.
They enter tonight's NHL draft lottery 2023 (8 p.m., ESPN) from NHL Network headquarters in Secaucus, New Jersey, in the ninth spot, with 5% odds of picking first.
Here's what you need to know about, and follow live updates below.
The draft is set for June 28-29 (Wednesday/Thursday) at Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tennessee, with Round 1 on the first night and Rounds 2-7 the following day.
It's considered a marquee draft class thanks to Connor Bedard of the WHL’s Regina Pats, who has been the consensus to go first overall for a couple of years. He possesses an ability to maneuver the puck that leaves opponents helpless, and will have an immediate impact on the trajectory of the team that gets him.
BIG HOPE:Here's what winning the 2023 NHL draft lottery would do for Red Wings
Adam Fantilli (Michigan Wolverines) is projected to go second after becoming just the third freshman to win the Hobey Baker Award this past season. He was the top scorer in the NCAA, showcasing a fast game and a willingness to mix it up physically. Like Bedard, Fantilli is a center.
There are 14 balls, numbered 1 to 14, placed in a lottery machine. For each drawing, the machine will spit out four balls, and the resulting four-number combination (without regard to selection order) will be matched against a chart that shows all possible combinations and the team to which each combination was assigned pre-lottery. This is similar, but slightly different than how the NBA conducts its lottery, which takes place May 16.
There are two lottery drawings, one for the first pick and one for the second pick.
Read more details directly from the NHL, which includes this year's combination chart.
FREE AGENCY:Red Wings need to upgrade their goaltending. Here are 3 options
Here are the odds for the first lottery draw.
The NHL changed the lottery after the fiasco in 2020, when the Wings had the worst record but were pushed back to fourth. Now, teams cannot jump more than 10 spots, and only the worst 11 teams are eligible for the first pick. If a team that entered the lottery in spots 12 to 16 wins the first drawing, the first pick goes to the worst team (the Ducks), and the team that ""won"" the drawing locks into its new position. (For example, if the 16th place Flames ""won"" the first drawing, they would move up 10 spots to No. 6).
A second drawing is held for the second overall pick, using a re-seeded order following the first drawing. The odds for the remaining teams will increase on a proportionate basis for the second draw, based on which team wins the No. 1 pick. The winner is still restricted to moving up 10 spots.

The Red Wings can end up choosing first, second, third, ninth, 10th or 11th. Their odds at each pick, according to the reputable Tankathon.com:
The Red Wings also have the New York Islanders’ first-rounder, No. 18 overall, acquired from the Vancouver Canucks in the Filip Hronek trade.

They are hoping for better luck this May; in their six previous lottery turns, the Red Wings have slid down four times (though they’ve stayed put in the past two). The Wings in 2022 took center Marco Kasper at No. 8 overall.

288,Report: Colts’ Morocco Brown ‘Traveled Almost Weekly’ to Evaluate New QB Anthony Richardson  - Stampede Blue,https://www.stampedeblue.com/2023/5/8/23715559/report-colts-morocco-brown-traveled-almost-weekly-to-evaluate-new-qb-anthony-richardson,"Filed under:
The Colts left no stone unturned regarding their scouting evaluation of new quarterback Anthony Richardson, which was conducted almost weekly. 
According to ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler (subscription), Indianapolis Colts chief personnel executive Morocco Brown “traveled almost weekly” to check on the progress of freshly drafted former Florida quarterback Anthony Richardson, who was just selected by the Horseshoe with the #4 overall pick in this year’s NFL Draft: 
“Richardson’s agent, Deiric Jackson, said (Morocco) Brown traveled to Florida almost weekly to check on Richardson’s progress,” writes Fowler. 
Now, we already knew that Brown initially led the Colts’ heavy scouting efforts on Richardson, dating all the way back to this past August: 
“I give our scouts credit now,” Ballard said during his ‘Day 1’ post-draft press conference on his scouting department’s thorough evaluation of Richardson. “You know Morocco Brown went in and like back in August, I’m getting these text messages from Morocco who’s at Florida practice saying, ‘You should see the show I’m watching on this practice field right now.’ So we have some awareness of who he was and what his talent level was a while ago.”
Brown is on record of calling Richardson, “A purple spotted unicorn, something you’re never going to see again,” so it sounds like it was ‘love at first sight’ in Gainesville, Florida, when he first made a scouting trip—and he was pretty well one of Richardson’s biggest supporters from the get-go. 
We also know that Brown made at least a few trips to see Richardson down in the Sunshine State throughout the Gators’ past season. However, just how extensive those trips were is now being roughly revealed: almost weekly—which is an exhaustive evaluation by the Colts. 
It’s clear that the Colts performed more than their due diligence on Richardson and rigorously vetted him regarding his mental makeup, character, performance, improvement, athleticism, work ethic, and practice habits—in the hopes that he can put it all together to become the Horseshoe’s next franchise QB. 
While initial patience will be required, he very well could be in time. Just ask Brown.

289,NFL executives compliment and critique Ravens’ selection of Zay Flowers - Baltimore Beatdown,https://www.baltimorebeatdown.com/2023/5/8/23715557/nfl-executives-compliment-and-critique-ravens-selection-of-zay-flowers-nfl-draft-news,"Filed under:
Anonymous NFL execs and evaluators talk Ravens’ selection of WR Zay Flowers
If you buy something from an SB Nation link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.
Media members aren’t the only ones with opinions on each NFL teams draft class, as The Athletic’s Mike Sando interviewed NFL executives and evaluators regarding all 32 teams draft hauls. Of course, this comes with the courtesy of anonymity, but a few had things to say about the Ravens’ draft class, and more specifically, first-round wide receiver Zay Flowers.
“Flowers’ upside is Stefon Diggs,” one evaluator told Sando. “He has that from a route-running capacity.”
One NFL executive believes Flowers could be a more explosive player for the Ravens’ offense than former first-round Raven Marquise “Hollywood” Brown.
“Even though Zay is a small target, from a ball-in-hand, explosive play, run-after-catch standpoint, he gives them that more than Hollywood Brown did,” an exec said to Sando. “That is where I don’t have a problem with the player. I just think you have to have a plan for him.”
Not all were complimentary toward the selection, with one concerned about Flowers’ size.
“If we learned anything at Baltimore with Lamar Jackson, it’s that small, short receivers don’t do well,” an evaluator said. “The guy he throws it to is the 6-6 tight end.”
It’s worth mentioning Brown posted a 1,000-yard season with the Ravens in 2021 and was Jackson’s second favorite target.
Flowers does join a more complete receiver corps, and that an evaluator noted how the offense run by offensive coordinator Todd Monken will be complimentary toward all in the offense, but not to disregard Andrews.
“Monken is a receiver coach by trade,” an evaluator said to Sando. “OBJ will be the big wild card. Is he going to still have big-game potential? I like their core. It has gotten better. That said, none of those guys are true No. 1s, which the Ravens can actually get away with. It is scheme, play-action, and their No. 1 guy is Mark Andrews, basically.”

292,Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg wins medals on jiu-jitsu debut | Mark Zuckerberg | The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/08/facebook-founder-mark-zuckerberg-jiu-jiutsu,"Tech billionaire, 38, surprises onlookers by winning gold and silver medal at tournament in Redwood City, California

Mark Zuckerberg is adding one more title to his résumé: medal-winning martial artist.
The Facebook and Meta founder won gold and silver medals at his very first Brazilian jiu-jitsu tournament in Redwood City, California, to the shock of many in the martial arts community and probably more widely.
The 38-year-old tech billionaire said he took up an interest in the sport early on in the pandemic and he posted his win on Instagram, saying: “Competed in my first jiu-jitsu tournament and won some medals for the Guerrilla Jiu Jitsu team.”
One of his coaches, Khai “the Shadow” Wu, congratulated his student: “Yesterday getting to see Zuck compete was pretty epic. No match was easy and everything was earned. It was an honor to be able to help coach and offer any advice I could.”
Zuckerberg received support for his new hobby from several high-profile athletes.
Former UFC champion and student of anger management Conor McGregor commented on the post: “Yo!!! F***ing awesome Mark.”
Brazilian Bernardo Faria, the five-time world jiu-jitsu champion, said of Zuckerberg’s win: “Amazing!!! Half guard, arm-bars, triangle! Super cool!’”
Other celebrities also congratulated the tech nerd-turned-athlete on his success. US TV host and former teen heartthrob Mario Lopez commented with three fire emojis.
Other famous people have also taken up the sport.
Actor Ashton Kutcher, who took up jiu-jitsu more than a decade ago, has a brown belt in the sport. Actor Jason Statham and comedian Russell Brand have purple belts.
The Peaky Blinders and Venom star Tom Hardy also competes in the UK, and has won competitions in Wolverhampton and Milton Keynes.",1
293,Fantasy Baseball Week 6 Preview: Pitchers to stream and stolen base strategy,https://sports.yahoo.com/fantasy-baseball-week-6-preview-pitchers-to-stream-and-stolen-base-strategy-155528740.html,"Loyal readers will notice a new addition to this column this week. In addition to detailing the fantasy hitters and starters who could produce stellar results in the coming days, there will now be a section dedicated to those who could provide valuable steals for roto managers.
Let’s dive in:
Chicago is set to face four Kansas City starters who each have a WHIP over 1.30. Managers in shallow leagues who have been disappointed by Luis Robert or Andrew Benintendi should keep them in the active lineup for this series. And Yasmani Grandal is a good fit for those who stream catchers.
The Mets could collect plenty of base knocks when they travel to offense-inducing Great American Ball Park and face a trio of starters (Luke Weaver, Hunter Greene, Nick Lodolo) who each have a WHIP over 1.40. Jeff McNeil (84% rostered) and Starling Marte (92%) are likely rostered in too many leagues but should remain active for this series. Also, Brett Baty (47%) and Mark Canha (13%) belong in most lineups until Friday.
New York hitters should feast during a three-game series against an A’s staff that owns a 7.25 ERA. And the club could add to their offensive totals against Drew Rasmussen of the Rays on Thursday. Gleyber Torres, Anthony Rizzo and Anthony Volpe should be active in all leagues this week, while DJ LeMahieu (78% rostered) and Harrison Bader (37%) belong in most lineups. Finally, Jose Trevino (5%) is a decent option for those who stream catchers.
The Giants have four games over the next four days, and three of those contests will come against underwhelming starters (Jake Irvin, Patrick Corbin, Tommy Henry). Two of those three hurlers throw from the left side, which makes Thairo Estrada (93%) and Mitch Haniger (59%) very appealing. Finally, Wilmer Flores (39%) and J.D. Davis (16%) can be considered in deep formats.
Based strictly on volume, hitters on the Red Sox, Braves, Blue Jays and Phillies are poor options over the next four days. Each club plays just two games, while the rest of the league plays at least three games, including eight clubs that have four contests. Toronto hitters are especially unappealing, as they face aces Zack Wheeler and Aaron Nola.
The Twins are throwing three skilled righties (Louie Varland, Pablo Lopez, Bailey Ober) against the Padres. San Diego’s four stars (Manny Machado, Juan Soto, Fernando Tatis Jr., Xander Bogaerts) can remain active, but the club’s other hitters belong on the bench until Friday.
Baltimore is off to a great start this year, but the team’s lineup might struggle to score runs against three Tampa starters (Shane McClanahan, Zach Eflin, Yonny Chirinos) who have logged an ERA below 2.30. The top-four fantasy hitters on the O’s (Adley Rutschman, Cedric Mullins, Ryan Mountcastle, Jorge Mateo) are the only ones who should be active in mixed leagues.
The Halos should have trouble scoring when they face three Houston starters (Hunter Brown, Framber Valdez, Cristian Javier) who each have an ERA below 3.55. Los Angeles hitters who are not named Shohei Ohtani, Mike Trout or Hunter Renfroe belong on the bench this week in most mixed formats.
Those who hope to pick up a couple of extra steals this week should target speedsters in these contests.
Brewers vs. Noah Syndergaard (Tuesday): Syndergaard is usually among the MLB leaders in steals allowed, and 2023 has been no exception. Brice Turang (9% rostered) does his best work against right-handers and is the player to stream in this game.
Royals vs. Mike Clevinger (Thursday): Clevinger sits in a tie for second in baseball with nine steals allowed. There isn’t a perfect streamer in this matchup, but Edward Olivares (5% rostered) is one speedy player who has caught my eye.
Phillies vs. Alek Manoah (Tuesday): In addition to posting a 4.71 ERA, Manoah has allowed seven steals. Bryson Stott (65% rostered) is a good candidate to swipe a bag before Manoah leaves the game.
In order, here are my favorite streamers (players rostered in less than 70% of Yahoo leagues) from Monday to Thursday, with their start date and Yahoo roster rate in parentheses.
Tanner Bibee vs. DET (Monday, 48)
Mitch Keller vs. COL (Monday, 65)
Bailey Ober vs. SD (Thursday, 38)
Jameson Taillon vs. STL (Tuesday, 39)
Josiah Gray @ SF (Wednesday, 41)

294,5 conclusions from La Vuelta Femenina | Cyclingnews,https://www.cyclingnews.com/features/5-conclusions-from-la-vuelta-femenina/,"When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Van Vleuten takes season's first win, Vollering-Realini top climbers, new faces in the finals, event enters a next phase
The first edition of the revamped La Vuelta Femenina concluded with Annemiek van Vleuten securing the overall title for her home team Movistar. 
Seven days of action-packed racing with a mountaintop finish atop the iconic Lagos de Covadonga has given way to a new phase for the event that started eight years ago as a one-day race in Madrid.
It marked the closing of the Spring Classics and the kick-off to the late spring and summer stage racing season, setting the stage to see who is on form for multi-day racing in the high mountains.
Cyclingnews highlights five main conclusions from the 2023 La Vuelta Femenina, ahead of the next two top-tier stage races in Spain at Itzulia Women from May 12-14 and Vuelta a Burgos from May 18-21.

Annemiek van Vleuten patiently worked her way into winning form, after struggling through the Spring Classics without a victory and her form constantly under the microscope, she has secured her first victory of the season as the overall winner at La Vuelta Femenina.
The victory comes later in the season than what is usual for Van Vleuten, who has won races Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, Strade Bianche, Tour of Flanders, and Liège-Bastogne-Liège in the past. She was uncertain about why her form seemed to be lacking this spring but also felt that the increased overall depth and strength of the peloton made it more challenging to win than ever before.
Movistar finished fourth in the team time trial in Torrevieja, and Van Vleuten kept herself in contention through the flatter stage 2 into Pilar de la Horadada, stage 3 into La Roda, a hilly stage 4 into Guadalajara as the race hit the bigger climbs.
Second in a sprint against Demi Vollering (SD Worx) on the first summit finish, Mirador de Peñas Llanas on stage 5 made way for a thrilling GC battle. Second again in a sprint against Gaia Realini (Trek-Segafredo) on the hilly stage 6 into Laredo, made way for Van Vleuten to take the leader's jersey from Vollering, who lost time after stopping for a nature break ahead of a decisive crosswind section.
Although Vollering made most of that time back on the stage 7 finale on Lagos de Covadonga, Van Vleuten had just enough to keep her overall lead by just nine seconds.
She may not have been the strongest climber of the week, but she certainly showed consistency across all seven stages, which bodes well for the summer racing season as her form continues to improve.

Annemiek van Vleuten (Movistar) may have won the overall classification, but she struggled at times to keep pace in the mountains with the event's top climbers, Demi Vollering (SD Worx) and Gaia Realini (Trek-Segafredo).
One has to wonder if the final overall classification would be different had Vollering not stopped for a nature break ahead of a decisive crosswind section on stage 6, just as Movistar planned their attack. In what was a controversial scenario, Vollering, who started the day in the leader's jersey, ended up moving down to second overall at 1:11 behind Van Vleuten.
Van Vleuten went on to create a two-rider breakaway and finished second to Realini. The Italian had already proved to be one of the climbers to watch this year, especially after finishing third at Flèche Wallonne, but her performances at La Vuelta Femenina confirmed that she is a real contender for the overall classification in the major mountain stage races this year.
Despite losing time on stage 6, Vollering pulled almost all of it back on the decisive Lagos de Covadonga, where she won 11 seconds over Realini, but 56 seconds to Van Vleuten. 
It was this performance, coupled with her dominance to win all three of the Ardennes Classics, that points to Vollering and Realini as two of the overwhelming favourites for the targetted Tour de France Femmes, which tackles the Tourmalet in July.

The event, formerly known as Challenge by La Vuelta, started as a one-day race in Madrid in 2015 and expanded to two stages in 2018, and a third stage was added in 2020. The race was further expanded in 2021 to four stages and then, last year, to five stages, where Annemiek van Vleuten won the overall titles in both editions.
For the first time since the inaugural event, the peloton competed over 700 kilometres with more than 8,500 metres of elevation across seven stages at the revamped event that organisers moved to May.
The mix of sprint and undulating early stages followed by three challenging final stages, which included the stage 7 grand finale that finished atop Lagos de Covadonga, a 16km ascent with an average of 7.4%, and which is the most featured mountaintop finish in La Vuelta’s history, marked a new phase of La Vuelta Femenina.
Many questioned how much the event's organisers were serious about their women's event and whether it could be considered a Grand Tour given its route history. 
Previous to this year's event, Van Vleuten had stated that it wasn't challenging enough to be considered on the same level as the Giro d'Italia Donne or Tour de France Femmes.
However, the difficulty of the stages this year, coupled with the dramatic racing that took place across the seven days of racing, gave the event a whole new look and feel.
Whether the race stays in the May spot will soon be confirmed as organisers have indicated it could change dates again in the future.

There were a few riders who took another step up in their form this season, and most prominent was Marianne Vos (Jumbo-Visma), winning three stages and spent time wearing the overall race leader's jersey in the early stages of the event.
Vos' form was in question after a turbulent start that saw her recover from surgery to correct pelvic artery constriction, which sidelined her from defending her rainbow jersey at the Cyclocross World Championships.
Like Van Vleuten, she also took her first win of the season as part of Jumbo-Visma in the opening team time trial at La Vuelta Femenina. She finished second on stage 2, behind Charlotte Kool (Team DSM), to take the race lead and then went on to secure two more wins on stage 3 and stage 4, signalling that she is indeed back at her top form.
Kool's stage win into Pilar de la Horadada was also a sign that she is back at her best after a promising start to the season, where she took two stages at the UAE Tour.
Another rider who made a strong start to her European racing season was Chloé Dygert (Canyon-SRAM). The former time trial World Champion and seven-time track World Champion returned to racing after a 14-month break from road racing due to a variety of health issues, including a lengthy recovery from a leg injury, Epstein Barr, and heart problems.
La Vuelta Femenina marked her first stage race in Europe with Canyon-SRAM, and she helped the team to second place in the team time trial and two more podium finishes on stage 2 and stage 3. Although she pulled out of the race ahead of the mountains on stage 6, her performance showed a promising ahead of the rest of the season.

Ricarda Bauernfeind (Canyon-SRAM Racing), Évita Muzic and Loes Adegeest (FDJ-SUEZ) and Alena Ivanchenko (UAE Team ADQ) are just a few of the new faces that worked their way into the top results across the seven stages of La Vuelta Femenina.
As Jumbo-Visma stormed to the opening team time trial win, it was Anna Henderson who took the event's first leader's jersey.
As the race progressed, and many of professional cycling's familiar faces secured stage wins and podiums, there were some stand-out performances beginning with Blanka Vas (SD Worx), Rachele Barbieri (Liv Racing TeqFind) and Alba Teruel (Laboral Kutxa Fundación Euskadi), and Nina Kessler (Team Jayco AlUla), all sprinting into the top-10 on the second day of racing.
On the third day, Emma Norsgaard (Movistar), who had just returned to racing, and Tamara Dronova-Balabolina (Israel Premier Tech Roland) also were part of the finale into La Roda. Lizzie Deignan (Trek-Segafredo), who returning from maternity leave at the Ardennes Classics, raced to sixth on stage 4, showing that she is easing into promising form for her targets later in the season.
On the climbs, Bauernfeind and Muzic challenged for the stage win on the first summit atop Mirador de Peñas Llanas, finishing third and fourth, respectively. And the pair, again, showed their climbing strength on Lagos de Covadonga, finishing fourth and fifth, respectively, and both securing top-10 overall.

The Braves are getting another key player back with the return of Travis d’Arnaud
The Atlanta Braves are getting another key player back in time for their two-game series against the Boston Red Sox. The team announced Monday that catcher Travis d’Arnaud has been reinstated from the 7-day concussion list. To make room on the active roster, Atlanta optioned Chadwick Tromp back to Gwinnett. 
The #Braves today returned C Travis d’Arnaud from his rehabilitation assignment and reinstated him from the injured list. The club optioned C Chadwick Tromp to Gwinnett following yesterday’s game.
d’Arnaud has been out since April 8 when he suffered a concussion in a collision at home plate against the San Diego Padres. He recently began ramping up activity and completed a  three-game rehab stint with Gwinnett where he didn't report any issues. d’Arnaud appeared in just eight games before the injury and was hitting .333/.333/.424 with a 104 wRC+ in 33 plate appearances. 
Sean Murphy has shouldered the load with d’Arnaud out and has emerged as one of the Braves’ biggest offensive weapons. Since d’Arnaud went on the injured list on April 9, Murphy is hitting .302/.429/.698 with nine home runs and a 197 wRC+. He currently leads the majors with 2.1 fWAR. 
With d’Arnaud back, Brian Snitker will have to determine how best to use him. He should see plenty of opportunities at DH while easing his way back into the mix behind the plate.

297,Royals acquire pitcher James McArthur from Phillies; designate Franmil Reyes for assignment - Royals Review,https://www.royalsreview.com/2023/5/8/23715382/royals-acquire-pitcher-james-mcarthur-from-phillies-designate-franmil-reyes-for-assignment,"Filed under:
The 26-year old right-hander was recently designated for assignment by the Phillies.
The Royals announced they have acquired pitcher James McArthur from the Philadelphia Phillies in exchange for outfielder Junior Marin and cash considerations. To make room on the 40-man roster, they designated outfielder Franmil Reyes for assignment.
McArthur is a 26-year old right-hander who was originally a 12th round pick out of Ole Miss in 2018 and stands at an imposing 6’7’’, 230 pounds. He was added to the 40-man roster after the 2021 season, but struggled in Double-A with a 5.05 ERA in 13 starts, and missed the second half of the season with elbow stress reaction.
McArthur’s fastball was down in 2022, but Eric Longenhagen reported he was back up to the mid-90s this spring. He ranked McArthur as the #32 prospect in the Phillies farm system, writing: 
His fastball plays down a bit due to its shape and angle, so every tick of velocity he has will be important. He works with sink and has a two-plane curveball that operates as his most frequent secondary pitch, while a rare cutter has begun to creep into his usage, which will hopefully give him a tool to keep hitters off his fastballs. Without a true plus pitch, McArthur looks more like an up/down depth option than a true on-roster, middle-inning archetype.
McArthur has pitched 16 innings in Triple-A this year with 15 strikeouts and 7 walks and a 7.31 ERA. He was designated for assignment last week to make room for pitcher Jeff Hoffman. The Royals have been shuttling relievers up and down in the last week, and have gotten poor results from many pitchers at Triple-A Omaha. McArthur will likely begin there but could be brought up as part of the revolving door in the bullpen.
Junior Marin is a 19-year old outfielder the Royals signed out of Venezuela. Last year he hit .315/.379/.413 in 30 games for the Arizona Complex League team, and he has not played in an affiliated game this year.
Franmil Reyes was signed to a minor league deal this off-season and made the Opening Day roster, but hit just .186/.231/.288 with two home runs in 19 games and a 36.9 percent strikeout rate. He was optioned to Triple-A Omaha last week, where he was 3-for-15 with one home runs and seven strikeouts. The Royals can trade him within seven days, or he can be claimed on waivers. If he clears, he can be released or outrighted back to Omaha.

Joe Douglas had fallen asleep on the couch in his New Jersey living room on the night of March 12 with his cell phone in his hand.
Around 12:30 a.m., the phone rang.
It was David Dunn, the agent for Aaron Rodgers, calling from California. It was a call the Jets general manager had been waiting for. It was a call the entire Jets organization had been waiting for. Heck, it was a call that the entire NFL world had been waiting for.
“Aaron’s playing and he wants to be a New York Jet,” Dunn told Douglas.
Months of conversations and debates had led to this. Rodgers, a four-time league MVP, wanted to play for the Jets, a team that has not been in the Super Bowl since the days leading up to Richard Nixon’s inauguration.
Now, Douglas found himself alone with this monumental news as Sunday night turned into Monday morning. He ran around his house muffling his screams so that he would not wake up his family. The family dogs gave Douglas strange looks. He began firing off text messages to others inside the Jets organization to see if anyone was awake. No one was.
Douglas stayed up until 4 a.m., unable to sleep, knowing the Jets organization was on the verge of a historic moment.
In the morning, he connected with coach Robert Saleh, who pointed out the Jets still had not heard confirmation from Rodgers himself that he wanted to be a Jet.
It would be three more days before Rodgers told the world of his intention on “The Pat McAfee Show” and another six weeks before Rodgers would actually become a Jet, what Douglas would call: “Ultimately being able to get what we feel is a historic trade for this franchise.”
This is the story of how the Jets came to acquire one of the greatest quarterbacks in NFL history from those who were involved this offseason.
As the dust from the 2022 season settled, the Jets began to formulate their list of quarterback options. The team had just finished 7-10, losing its final six games. It had wasted a strong defense and emerging young skill players largely because of poor quarterback play. Zach Wilson’s confidence had been shattered and the Jets knew they could not go into 2023 with him as their starter.
Days after the season ended, owner Woody Johnson said he would “absolutely” spend big on a veteran quarterback and called it the “missing piece.”
The front office and coaches began to go through the list of every potential quarterback option from the long shots like Daniel Jones hitting free agency to players expected to be available like Derek Carr and Jimmy Garoppolo.
At the time, it was unclear what the future held for Rodgers. The Packers and their star had done a strange dance for years, and the 2023 offseason looked like it would be a continuation of that. The Jets narrowed their list to three or four players and Rodgers was at the top of the list.
Douglas and Packers GM Brian Gutekunst spoke in January and the Packers still were not sure what their plan was, but Douglas told Gutekunst the Jets would have interest if Rodgers became available.
During this time, the Jets also hired Nathaniel Hackett as their new offensive coordinator. Hackett had spent three seasons in Green Bay with Rodgers and the two had a close bond, fueling more speculation that Rodgers would eventually be a Jet.
Hanging over the entire possibility of Rodgers was the unknown of what he wanted to do. Would he retire? If he wanted to keep playing, did he want to finish his career as a Packer? Would he even consider the Jets?
Rodgers went on his “darkness retreat” in late February and contemplated his future.
The Jets knew they could not just wait on Rodgers and they began courting Carr, who had been released by the Raiders. They met with him in New Jersey and then again at the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis.
At the combine during the first week of March, it became clear the Packers were ready to trade Rodgers. The Packers reached out to the Jets and told them that they were one of the teams Rodgers was interested in and gave the Jets permission to speak to Dunn about Rodgers.
This was not a typical trade where teams search for the highest bidder. Rodgers did not have a no-trade clause, but effectively did because no team was trading for him unless it knew he wanted to play there. He also had a monster contract that would have to be handled by the acquiring team.
The Packers were only going to negotiate with the team Rodgers wanted to go to. Douglas and Gutekunst spoke by phone during the combine about a trade. At the time the Packers were looking for a deal similar to what the Seahawks got for Russell Wilson and the Lions got for Matthew Stafford. Both deals included two first-round picks. The Jets had no interest in trading two first-round picks for a 39-year-old who might play only one season in New York.
The trade could have died there, but the Packers granted the Jets permission to speak to Rodgers directly even though the two teams had not agreed on trade compensation, which was highly unusual and would set the stage for a dramatic standoff.
The Jets and Rodgers began having phone conversations on Monday, March 6. After a few calls, the Jets decisionmakers huddled up and discussed the next step. Typically, teams invite prospective players to visit them. Saleh proposed the Jets traveling to visit Rodgers to show how serious they were. Saleh called Rodgers and asked if they could visit him at his Malibu home. He agreed.
The next day, Saleh, Douglas, team president Hymie Elhai and Hackett boarded a private jet from New Jersey. Woody Johnson flew from Florida and his brother and team vice chairman Christopher flew from Colorado.
Christopher Johnson arrived about 30 minutes before everyone else and instantly bonded with Rodgers. The rest of the group arrived and they spent five hours at Rodgers’ home in a casual, get-to-know-you session. Rodgers hit it off with Woody Johnson as well as Douglas and Saleh with Hackett serving as a friendly face for the quarterback.
The Jets did not want this to be a business meeting and did not arrive with a hard pitch for Rodgers. There were no PowerPoint presentations. Instead, the Jets wanted Rodgers to be able to ask them questions and find out about their philosophy. They discussed the Jets roster and spent the day figuring out if it was a match.
The Jets did not press him about how long he would play or whether he would participate in the offseason program.
“We had a nice conversation,” Rodgers would say later. “I told them, ‘Listen, I’m not ready to make a decision about anything. I want to get back into my workouts and see how it feels to really hit it hard for a week and to see if that drive and passion is still there.’ ”
Saleh and Woody Johnson parked their cars on the street, which attracted photographers, which amused Rodgers.
Jets ownership flew home while the others spent the night at a Santa Monica hotel wondering what would come next.
The Jets’ permission to speak to Rodgers expired on March 11, the Saturday after the Tuesday meeting and two days before the free agency negotiating window opened.
Douglas spoke with Rodgers on the night of March 10 for the last time. Rodgers still did not say what his plans were, but there was a sense he was not retiring.
The Jets had to sweat out the weekend, wondering if Rodgers was coming and trying to figure out where to pivot if he did not. Carr had signed with the Saints the week before. Like fans on sports talk radio, the Jets brass debated whether they should just go all in on Carr before he signed with the Saints. They decided to ride it out with Rodgers, who was their No. 1 choice.
Still, as of Sunday night they did not know what his plans were and they knew free agents would be flying off the board the following day.
That is when Dunn’s late-night call to Douglas came and eased their concerns … somewhat. They still wanted to hear it from Rodgers.
The Jets and Packers continued to talk about trade parameters but had nothing close.
Then, Rodgers went on “The Pat McAfee Show” that Wednesday and everything changed.
Douglas, Saleh, Elhai and Jets senior vice president Eric Gelfand gathered in Douglas’ office to watch McAfee. Moments before Rodgers was coming on the show, the power went out in the Jets’ Florham Park headquarters. After a brief moment of panic, the power came back on.
“It is my intention to play for the Jets,” Rodgers said in the most monumental Jets quote since Joe Namath guaranteed Super Bowl III.
""Since Friday my intention was to play for the New York Jets.. it's the compensation that's holding things up"" ~ @AaronRodgers12#PMSLive pic.twitter.com/p7i0QBo2qQ
Everyone in Douglas’ office looked at each other, sharing the same “I can’t believe this is happening” feeling.
But the appearance on McAfee slowed down the negotiations with the Packers. The Jets were worried that Rodgers said he was “90 percent retired” entering the darkness retreat. The Packers were annoyed with how Rodgers portrayed them.
The trade negotiations stopped.
Talks resumed in late March just before the league meetings in Scottsdale, Ariz. Douglas and Gutekunst had phone calls before meeting that week at the Biltmore Resort for the only face-to-face negotiation in this whole process.
The Packers had backed off the demand for two first-round picks but were insisting on a first-rounder in 2024. The Jets wanted to give them a second-round pick in the 2023 draft and a conditional pick in 2024 that could become a first-round pick only if certain conditions were met.
There was still a gap between the two sides but it was narrowing.
There was a lull in negotiations again after the league meetings. The two sides always knew that the draft would serve as a soft deadline to get things done. The Packers wanted a pick in this year’s draft. The Jets wanted to get Rodgers into their building as soon as possible.
A week before the draft, the trade talks intensified. The Packers moved off the demand for an unconditional 2024 first-round pick. The Jets softened the conditions on the second-round pick becoming a first-rounder in 2024. The two sides negotiated through the weekend.
On the Monday before the draft, the two sides agreed on two pick swaps this year, one trading first-round picks (13 and 15) and one trading a Packers fifth-rounder for a Jets sixth-rounder. The Jets also agreed that the conditional second-round pick in 2024 would become a first-round pick if Rodgers played 65 percent of the offensive snaps in 2023, an easier bar to clear than what the Jets had asked for earlier. In addition, the Jets sent a 2023 second-round pick to the Packers.
Douglas was sitting in a draft meeting when Gutekunst called. The two talked for 45 minutes and finalized the deal. Douglas presented it to Woody Johnson, who signed off on it. Douglas called Gutekunst back and said they had a deal.
Douglas then informed David Socie, the team’s senior director of football administration, that the paperwork was coming his way.
As he spoke to Socie, Douglas looked across the hall to the draft room, where Saleh and others were. He flashed a thumbs up to Saleh and the room exploded. Douglas then walked in and said, “We have our quarterback.”
A day after the trade was agreed to, Rodgers flew to Florham Park. The next morning, he walked into One Jets Drive wearing a Jets hooded sweatshirt and was greeted at the door by the Johnsons, Saleh, Douglas and Elhai.
Months of talk had become reality. Rodgers was really a Jet.
Rodgers completed his physical and Douglas signed the trade papers. Someone snapped a photo of Douglas signing them and passed it along to him as a memento.
The biggest press conference the Jets have had in more than a decade came a short time later.
“I’m an old guy, so I want to be part of a team that can win it all,” Rodgers said. “I believe this is a place we can get that done.”
The Rodgers effect is already being felt inside the Jets. In his first two weeks, he has connected with teammates, coaches and staffers in a way that the Jets only could have dreamed of. He has embraced New York City by attending Knicks and Rangers playoff games.
Jets season-ticket and suite sales are up 400 percent to date versus all of last year.
In the first two days Rodgers was officially a Jet, Fanatics reported they had sold $900,000 in Aaron Rodgers gear and the total Jets eCommerce sales was $1.2 million.
The Jets website and social media has exploded since Rodgers joined the team. The Rodgers press conference was the most viewed live event in Jets history with 750,000 views across all of their social media platforms.
The true Rodgers effect won’t be felt until he takes his first snap in a Jets uniform. But it is already clear he has altered the franchise.
It was a long, winding road to get here. One that began with hypothetical conversations in January, featured a darkness retreat in February, grew to meetings and McAfee in March and continued through the final conversations and a press conference in April.
The story will continue to unfold in the coming months. The Jets hope the best chapters come next January and February.

301,"Bears sign Stephen Carlson, D’Anthony Jones, Josh Lugg, Bralen Trahan. - NBC Sports Chicago",https://www.nbcsports.com/chicago/bears/bears-sign-stephen-carlson-danthony-jones-josh-lugg-bralen-trahan,"Watch



     src=""https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=674090812743125&ev=PageView&noscript=1""/>

A handful of players earned themselves some extra time with the Bears over the course of last weekend’s rookie minicamp. The team announced on Monday that they’d signed four players after the two-day camp: TE Stephen Carlson, DL D’Anthony Jones, OL Josh Lugg and DB Bralen Trahan.
In corresponding moves, the Bears also waived OL Nick Amoah, DB Justin Broiles andTE Damien Caffrey.
Carlson spent the 2019-2021 seasons with the Cleveland Browns, but was out of football last year. In his Cleveland career, Carlson played in 25 games (seven starts) and caught six passes for 62 yards and a touchdown. He took the majority of his snaps on special teams.
Jones is an undrafted rookie out of Houston. Over the past two seasons, he was a major backfield disruptor as an edge rusher for the Cougars. Since 2021, he notched 14.5 sacks, 21 TFL and eight forced fumbles. His five forced fumbles in 2022 tied for most in the country.
Lugg is an undrafted rookie from Notre Dame. He was a sixth-year senior in 2022 and started every game for the Fighting Irish at right guard. In 2021, he started every game at right tackle. Prior to that, Lugg had five starts at right tackle, one start at right guard and two at center.
Trahan is an undrafted rookie defensive back from Louisiana. He’s another six-year senior with lots of experience, and played in 67 games over his Ragin’ Cajun career. Trahan was a ballhawk in college with 13 interceptions, 29 PBUs, two forced fumbles and two fumble recoveries. He also did well once he had the ball in his hands. Trahan averaged 24.8 return yards on his 13 interceptions, and scored one touchdown.
The Bears will hold their first OTA of the season on May 22.

303,"Ageing will now improve Miami track surface, say F1 race organisers",https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/ageing-will-now-improve-miami-track-surface-say-f1-race-organisers/10467018/,"The asphalt at the Hard Rock Stadium track was re-laid by circuit specialists Tilke for this year’s Miami Grand Prix, following problems in the inaugural 2022 event. 
However, the surface still posed issues for drivers with a lack of grip – especially off the racing line – which triggered a number of incidents throughout the weekend. 
One of the factors that limited the grip on offer was the decision by Miami race chiefs not to waterblast the surface – which helps remove a layer of bitumen and oil that is present on newly-laid asphalt. 
But while that posed some drawbacks for this weekend, Miami GP managing partner Tom Garfinkel says the move will now pay off as a more natural ageing of the surface will make it better for the long haul. 
“Without doing the water blasting, it'll have a little more longevity,” explained Garfinkel. “It will also change over time. I think this climate with the sun and the humidity, and some other things will affect the track but, as it ages, it's supposed to get better.” 
While the track surface was difficult for drivers in practice and qualifying, race winner Max Verstappen reckoned it was good enough by the race.  
“I think it improved quite a bit over the weekend,” said the Red Bull driver. “I was a little bit afraid, of course, with the rain that it would be a bit worse, but most places were quite okay.  
“It's a street circuit. You can't expect it to be amazing offline, that's how it goes. But overall, I think it was a lot more fun to drive compared to last year. I think the tarmac has been a lot better. So yeah, it was absolutely fine. I think it's not a bad track.”

One other factor that did not help with the track surface was the lack of support race series, with only a single Porsche event alongside F1. That limited the amount of rubber that was being laid down over the race weekend to help improve grip. 
Asked if Miami was considering getting more support races on board for 2024, Garfinkel said: “We're contemplating it. I think if you get more rubber on the track offline, you're going to have better racing during the race. And it's just more entertainment, more racing for the fans. So, if we can do that, that might make sense.” 
Garfinkel also reckoned that changes Miami made to the configuration of the Turn 15/16 chicane also worked really well. 
Last year, the layout was criticised for being too tight, and raised some concerns from drivers after Carlos Sainz and Esteban Ocon spun in to the wall in that area of the circuit. 
Revisions were made to both the barriers and the profile of the chicane, which Garfinkel said got praise from drivers – as did the removal of several bumps. 
“Last year it was a little bumpy at places, but we've gotten feedback from the drivers that it is much smoother,” he said. 
“Then the mitigation in turn 15/16 was really after feedback we got from George Russell. We talked to all the drivers, we talked to all the team principals, we talked to the FIA, F1 and everyone had differing opinions about 15/16 and what we should do. 
“But the conclusion was really with F1 and the FIA to try to just soften the apex a little bit and take the kerbs down a little.  
“It was a little smoother through there. It was originally kind of a harsh corner because of safety and trying to really work hard to slow the cars down before you got through there.  
“This year, we’ve softened that a little bit, and the feedback we've gotten is that they like it much better.”

304,Warriors News: Warriors don’t blame officiating for Game 3 loss vs. Lakers - Golden State Of Mind,https://www.goldenstateofmind.com/2023/5/8/23715060/dub-hub-daily-warriors-links-for-5-8-23-warriors-do-not-blame-officiating-game-3-loss-vs-lakers,"Filed under:

Good Morning Dub Nation,

The Golden State Warriors lost Game 3 against the Los Angeles Lakers over the weekend, 127-97. The blowout defeat puts them down 2-1 in the series, however the conversations after the game centered around the large free-throw disparity between the two teams. 

In Game 3, the Warriors shot significantly less free-throws (17) than the Lakers (37) with a gap similar to that of Game 1. A lot of this is caused by the schematic differences of the two teams as the Lakers’ offense focuses on attacking the rim, while the Warriors tend to settle for jump shots — especially with Los Angeles center Anthony Davis relentlessly defending the paint. This leads to more free-throw attempts for the Lakers, which isn’t surprising considering they led the league in free-throw rate while the Warriors were among the teams that committed the most fouls. Having said that, Golden State won’t let the officiating be an excuse for their poor performance.

The constant free throws — along with turnovers, poor shot selection, and self-inflicted mistakes — disrupted the flow of the game and threw the Warriors off their rhythm. Before that, one could argue Golden State was in complete control of the game, however, a sloppy second quarter saw the defending champions uncharacteristically lose their poise.

Fortunately, spirits remain high as Golden State looks to bounce back in Game 4. The Warriors felt they let one slip away, but their vast postseason experience lends them confidence heading into tonight’s pivotal matchup.

305,Rankings Shakeup: Is Henry Cejudo a top 5 bantamweight again after narrow UFC 288 loss? - MMA Fighting,https://www.mmafighting.com/2023/5/8/23714614/rankings-shakeup-is-henry-cejudo-a-top-5-bantamweight-again-after-narrow-ufc-288-loss,"Filed under:
Aljamain Sterling remains king of the bantamweight class, but where does UFC 288’s result leave Henry Cejudo?
The former two-division champ lost a razor-thin split decision in his MMA return after three years away, coming within one scorecard of stealing the title away from Sterling. With his grand plans of three-division glory suddenly put on hold, Cejudo was noncommittal about his future in the aftermath of Saturday’s card; at least for now, though, he’s is back in the fold. So where does Cejudo fall in the current 135-pound pecking order?

    Related
  
That was a divisive question for MMA Fighting’s eight-person rankings panel, as Cejudo garnered votes as high as No. 3 and as low as unranked following his UFC 288 loss.
In the end, “Triple C” landed at No. 6, settling in behind Sterling, Merab Dvalishvili, Sean O’Malley, Cory Sandhagen, and Petr Yan, but ahead of Bellator’s own rock-star bantamweight Patchy Mix.
Is that the right call? Should Cejudo be higher or lower than we have here?

307,Grading the Committee: Uncontroversial Bracket With Simple Explanations | USA Lacrosse Magazine,https://www.usalaxmagazine.com/college/men/grading-the-committee-uncontroversial-bracket-with-simple-explanations,"PHOTO BY PEYTON WILLIAMS
Duke earned the No. 1 seed in this year's NCAA tournament.
Mon May 8 2023 | Patrick Stevens | College        
College Men 
The explanations were concise and direct, the bracket largely uncontroversial.
After the ruckus raised last year on Selection Sunday with a six-pack of Ivy League teams and the exclusion of Duke and Notre Dame, this season’s bracket reveal was downright sedate.
Oddly enough, it stemmed from the chaos sown by Michigan (Big Ten champions) and Princeton (Ivy champions) in their respective tournament.
“Denver was first out, without question,” said Denver deputy athletic director Brandon Macneill, the chair of the five-person selection committee. “Penn was second out. Then Villanova and Rutgers were looked at, but those two were slated in pending bid steals. Then Michigan bumped Penn, and then Princeton bumped Denver.”
Simple as that.
There was also solid early agreement on the ordering of Duke, Virginia and Notre Dame, the top three seeds. Macneill said Wednesday’s call with the 10-coach regional advisory committee provided especially valuable feedback on that front, and nothing changed over the weekend to change the order.
“The overwhelming majority of the RAC had Duke-Virginia-Notre Dame,” Macneill said. “We, as a committee, took that and said, ‘OK, well that’s the thinking’ and we agreed to it. When it all shook out, Duke by far was the No. 1 RPI. Virginia and Notre Dame were a lot closer to each other than Duke was to either of them. And then when you have the two head-to-heads, how could you possibly argue it any other way?”
One interested party in this is someone who has spent much of the last year studying the selection process. Virginia coach Lars Tiffany had no quibbles about the Cavaliers landing a No. 2 seed behind their longtime nemesis Duke.
“All week, some people were like, ‘Lars, I think they could put you 1,’” Tiffany said. “And I said, ‘If they make me 1, I’m going to punch somebody in the nose.’ They have a better RPI and they beat us twice. In so many ways, I can see their logic. It made sense.”
Macneill said the next band of teams included Maryland, Penn State, Johns Hopkins and Georgetown, with an apparent gap after that to eighth-seeded Cornell, unseeded Yale and others.
For teams seeded fourth through seventh, there was clearly a great deal of value placed on head-to-head results.
“Maryland had the best win of anybody [in that group], over UVA, they got to the championship game and they had the head-to-head over Penn State,” Macneill said. “As simple as this may sound, Penn State had the head-to-head over Hopkins. Then Georgetown’s best win was Denver. Georgetown’s worst loss was Penn, so they’re awesome. They just didn’t have the top-five wins that [others] had.”
The committee also produced a relatively cost-contained bracket. Only two teams — Michigan (to Cornell) and Utah (to Notre Dame) — will require flights to their first-round destinations.
“Denver was first out, without question. Penn was second out.”
— Brandon Macneill

The ACC powers
Who else? Duke, Virginia and Notre Dame separated themselves from the rest of the field this season, and they’re rightfully the top three seeds. They were a combined 29-2 against everybody else, with the lone blemishes coming when Duke tripped up at Jacksonville on Feb. 11 and Virginia fell at home to Maryland on March 18.
Yale
The bracket sort of gives it away. Yale is the only at-large team playing on the road, so it had to be the last team in the field. Macneill said it wasn’t particularly close. From the outside looking in, it would have been difficult to choose a Denver team with a worse RPI and a head-to-head loss to the Bulldogs (11-9 on March 11).
“There was no question on Yale over Denver,” Macneill said.
There was nonetheless probably a little anxiety in New Haven. Yale, which lost 19-10 to Princeton in Sunday’s Ivy League title game, was the last team revealed during the selection show.
Denver
There would be a very different conversation if Yale had beaten Princeton in the Ivy final. Or if Michigan fell to Maryland in the Big Ten title game. Or, of course, if Denver had won the Big East tournament.
Instead, Pioneers coach Bill Tierney’s career ultimately ended with a 14-5 loss to Georgetown on Saturday before an announced crowd of 334 in Milwaukee. It was remarkably anticlimactic for a Hall of Famer who led Princeton to six national titles and tacked on another in 2015 at Denver.
“You feel for Coach T,” Maryland coach John Tillman said. “I’m a big coach Tierney fan and respect him a lot. Certainly, he’s a legend and part of you would like to see him be in this tournament just because of what he’s done for the sport. Penn is right there and a dangerous team. I think if anybody played them, they’d be a tough out and they would give you some problems. I almost wish we had a bigger tournament because I think there were a lot of teams that were deserving that aren’t going to get the opportunity and are disappointed.”
Penn State
There aren’t exactly a bunch of “easy” draws floating around, but the fifth-seeded Nittany Lions get to sit around all weekend and wait for the Sunday night slot — the one that’s seen the home team lose in three of the last four NCAA tournaments. They’ll also face Princeton, which looks like it has figured things out after edging Penn and hammering Yale in the Ivy League tournament in New York.
If Penn State gets through, it could play a de facto road game against Maryland in the quarterfinals in Annapolis, Md. The Nittany Lions are plenty capable of making it to the semifinals, but there’s little doubt they’ll have to earn it.
Army vs. Maryland
Good luck finding an unseeded team in this tournament more consistent than Army. The Patriot League champions have been in every game, and their three losses are by a combined four goals. The Black Knights have scored between 10 and 12 goals in eight of their last nine games. They’re steady everywhere and deep on offense. You know exactly what you’re going to get.
Contrast that to Maryland, which has yo-yoed all over the place throughout the season. The ceiling is high and the floor is low in College Park, and that’s a very dangerous thing for the Terrapins considering who their buttoned-up opponent is.
“I think lacrosse is at a spot now where everybody is good,” Tillman said. “There are no easy games. Everybody has talent, everybody is well-coached, everybody is prepared. You have to go out and play a really good game if you hope to advance.”
Here’s the counterargument: Maryland hasn’t authored back-to-back duds all season, and it is coming off its most lopsided loss since 2006. The Terrapins are more than capable of winning, but no one should anticipate a blowout.
The single most puzzling part of the bracket has nothing to do with who was selected or how they were seeded. It’s where the top two seeds are heading if they advance to the quarterfinals. Both Duke and Virginia were sent to Albany, N.Y., rather than a closer-to-home assignment in Annapolis, Md.
“When we realized that about 10 minutes later, we were like, ‘That’s got to be a mistake,’” Tiffany said. “That was literally our first reaction. Why would they have Duke and Virginia, assuming we win, flying to Albany? I don’t have to look it up. I go to Lake Placid every August. I know from Charlottesville, I’m about 9-10 hours into my trip when I’m driving through Albany, so I know that’s over 400 miles.”
So what’s the deal? This is one thing the five members of the selection committee aren’t tasked with. Their priority is seeding the top eight teams, choosing the at-large teams and then bracketing the field.
“They ask our opinion a little bit, but a lot of it’s with the TV,” Macneill said. “It probably has to do with ticket sales and what not. We were asked about it, but we did not focus much surrounding that issue.”
Richmond at Virginia
It’s the only rematch of a regular season game, and what a forgettable contest that was — at least for Richmond, anyway. Virginia earned a 25-8 victory back on March 4, getting six goals from Xander Dickson to avenge last year’s 17-13 loss in Richmond.
The first round isn’t steeped in much postseason history; only three matchups that could be reprises of previous NCAA tournament encounters. Yale defeated Georgetown 19-16 in the 2019 first round. Duke beat Delaware in the first round in 2011. And Army and Maryland have split a pair of first-round games, with Army winning in 1993 and Maryland upending the Black Knights in 2004.
FO Cole Brams, Utah. If the Utes and their explosive offense are going to do damage, they’re going to need to win a lot of possessions. Enter Brams, who was 21 of 23 against Air Force on Sunday to earn A-Sun tournament MVP honors. He’s won 59.1 percent on the season and goes up against a Notre Dame faceoff unit that ranks 60th nationally in winning percentage at 44.1 percent.
A Matt Brandau, Yale. He isn’t the Bulldogs’ leading goal scorer (that’s Chris Lyons with 58), but he is their barometer. In Yale’s nine victories, Brandau has 28 goals and 25 assists, good for nearly six points a game. In five losses, he has six goals and six assists. He’s the straw that stirs the Elis’ drink at the offensive end.
A Tucker Dordevic, Georgetown. No one symbolizes the way the Hoyas’ revamped offense needed time to figure things out than the Syracuse graduate transfer. He shot 26.4 percent in his first eight games and is at 45.8 percent in the seven games since. Oh, and he has 57 goals in his lone year at Georgetown.
A Jamison Embury, Marist. The graduate student just had 15 goals and four assists in the Red Foxes’ three-game run to the Metro Atlantic title. He’ll be someone to keep an eye on when Marist visits Delaware in Wednesday’s play-in game.
D Owen Grant, Delaware. Tempting though it was to select attackman Tye Kurtz (49 G, 27 A) as the Blue Hens’ representative on this list, the nod goes to the three-time CAA defensive player of the year. Yet again, he’s one of the 10 best close defensemen in the country.
A Johnny Hackett, Bryant. The America East rookie of the year enters the postseason with 40 goals and 12 assists. He’s one of five Bulldogs with at least 40 points.
G Michael Gianforcaro, Princeton. Despite the graduation of Erik Peters, Tigers coach Matt Madalon felt good about his goalie room in the offseason. For good reason, it seems. Gianforcaro didn’t take over full-time duties in the cage until mid-March and owns a .592 save percentage, including a .634 mark over the last five contests.
A CJ Kirst, Cornell. He leads the country in goals with 63, and that only provides a glimmer of the value he provides the Big Red. Between him on attack and Gavin Adler on defense, Cornell might have the best player in the country at two different positions.
A TJ Malone, Penn State. The Nittany Lions don’t have a ton of stars, but they are deep and have plenty of useful pieces. Malone (27 G, 28 A) is one of nine players with at least 13 points for Penn State.
D Alex Mazzone, Johns Hopkins. What a massive boost Mazzone has provided on both faceoff wings and close defense for the Blue Jays. A long stick midfielder at Georgetown before joining the Blue Jays as a graduate transfer, Mazzone is a major part of Hopkins’ revitalization this season.
G Matthew Nunes, Virginia. The sophomore has played better in the second half of the season, and he had a career day in the Cavaliers’ regular-season finale. His 19 saves helped Virginia upend Notre Dame 12-8. If the Hoos get more of that, a third title in four tournaments could be in play.
A Brennan O’Neill, Duke. The likely Tewaaraton finalist heads into the postseason with 44 goals and 36 assists, and he was held to less than three points just once all season (when he scored once against Notre Dame). O’Neill can be both a finisher and a distributor, and teams will have to choose wisely how to deal with him.
D AJ Pilate, Army. The sophomore is the Patriot League’s defensive player of the year, and his motor makes him a fitting successor to some of the great defensive players to pass through West Point. He’s adept at not only separating a ball from a foe, but also a stick from an opponent as well. He’s well-equipped to handle a high-profile matchup or two in Army’s first NCAA appearance since 2019.
G Hunter Taylor, Michigan. The freshman played the final game and a half of the Big Ten tournament, posting a .688 save percentage as the Wolverines got past Penn State and then bludgeoned Maryland. Might Michigan ride its goalie even deeper into the postseason?
M Brian Tevlin, Notre Dame. The Irish’s star is attackman Pat Kavanagh, and there is a lot to like about the probable Tewaaraton finalist (including his relentless riding). But Tevlin is the sort who could pop up on the field at any time — on the first midfield, on faceoff wings, on a defensive shift, even man-down with a pole in his hand. The grad transfer from Yale is arguably the best Swiss Army knife in the postseason.
A Dalton Young, Richmond. In addition to forever being the answer to a trivia question (who is the first offensive player of the year in Atlantic 10 men’s lacrosse history), Young has 30 goals and 39 assists for the Spiders. He’s collected at least seven points in five of Richmond’s last eight contests.
FO Luke Wierman, Maryland. The reason the Terrapins were borderline unstoppable last season was Wierman repeatedly gave possession to a lethal offense. He was a luxury in 2022 and a necessity this season since Maryland doesn’t have dominant offensive personnel. Wierman is at 61.4 percent at the X in 2023, and the Terps need that sort of production in the postseason.

Luke Wierman was an X-factor for Maryland during its championship run last season.
Georgetown-Yale is absolutely bonkers
Georgetown has won 12 in a row and scored at least 12 goals in every game during that run. Yale has won games by margins of 20-14 (Villanova), 17-14 (Boston U), 21-11 (Dartmouth) and 22-15 (Cornell) and lost games by scores of 20-10 (Cornell), 23-10 (Princeton), 17-16 (Penn) and 19-10 (Princeton again).
Whatever the outcome, expect a bunch of goals to be scored in Saturday’s third game.
Prominent teams returning to the NCAA tournament
The headliners, of course, are top-seeded Duke and third-seeded Notre Dame, which saw lengthy postseason streaks end last season. But Penn State and Johns Hopkins landed top-six seeds and will make their first postseason appearances since 2019.
This isn’t a complete restoration of classic contenders. Syracuse has missed back-to-back tournaments for the first time since it made its initial appearance in 1979, and three schools that have won titles since 2012 (Loyola, Denver and North Carolina) are on the outside looking in.
Still, the experience of sitting at home last May had to provide at least some fuel for Duke and Notre Dame heading into this season. It is certain to be mentioned more than a few times.
1. The top three seeds reach Memorial Day weekend. Nothing fancy here, given how well Duke, Notre Dame and Virginia have fared all season. The top three seeds advanced to the semifinals in three consecutive tournaments (2018, 2019 and 2021) before second-seeded Georgetown and third-seeded Penn were upended early last season.
2. There will be some grousing in the Midwest about what amounts to a road game in the quarterfinals. If there is a chalky first round, third-seeded Notre Dame would face sixth-seeded Johns Hopkins in Annapolis, Md. The Irish easily could have been funneled into Albany, making this avoidable (unlike two years ago, when Notre Dame had hosting duties and was going to get a home game regardless of how it was seeded).
3. There will not be a first-time semifinalist. The only teams in the field that haven’t played on championship weekend are Bryant, Marist, Michigan, Richmond and Utah.  All of them must win a road game simply to get to the quarterfinals. Michigan is especially intriguing, but here’s guessing we’ll see some relatively familiar names in Philadelphia.
A
A lot of the hard decisions were made for this year’s committee thanks to the bid-thieving antics of Michigan and Princeton. Choosing Denver over Penn would have created a spirited debate. Picking Yale over Denver for the last spot really doesn’t.
The pairings were also fairly easy to deduce in advance. Utah had to fly somewhere; it might as well be to Notre Dame, which was going to need someone to fly to it in any bracket with competitive integrity. Michigan couldn’t play a Big Ten school in the first round, so its destinations were basically limited to Georgetown and whichever Ivy League school grabbed the last seeded spot (Cornell, in this case).
The only team seeded between Nos. 3 and 7 that Bryant could bus to within a 400-mile radius was Johns Hopkins. All of the Ivies could bus to Georgetown, but with the committee looking to avoid rematches when possible, Princeton was steered away from Georgetown and Maryland and sent to Penn State. That meant Yale went to Georgetown, Army was left to go to Maryland and Richmond was shipped to Virginia.
So, unlike last year, there aren’t many grumbles about the finished product. But Macneill, who was a part of the committee that produced last year’s lightning bolt, insisted the difference in creating the two brackets was nonexistent.
“We went through the exact same process yesterday — exact same process,” Macneill said. “And if Princeton and Michigan didn’t win, this process would have had Denver and Penn in there, and it would have been the exact same process. I think we have some names that are maybe a little more familiar than they were last year. For the most part, it’s the same group, and we went through the exact same deal.”

Rochester Americans coach Seth Appert diagrams plays for the Sabres' prospects last year.
 SYRACUSE – Seth Appert joined his players in the Rochester Americans locker room as soon as the third intermission began Saturday night.
Appert typically waits to address his team between periods. This time, he didn’t want them to sit silently and stew over the Syracuse Crunch scoring the tying goal with 29.9 seconds left in a win-or-go-home playoff game. The Amerks’ coach didn’t deliver an elaborate speech or criticize their performance in the final 20 minutes of regulation. His intent was to inspire confidence.
“I went in there immediately, which I don’t normally do, and said, ‘Take a breath, calm down, we’re gonna win this game,” he shared with reporters after Rochester completed an improbable comeback with a third consecutive victory to eliminate the Crunch and advance to the Calder Cup Playoffs’ North Division final round.
The group’s focus shifted to how it could prevail in overtime. There was talk about the next shift instead of what went wrong during the third period when the Amerks were outshot, 20-2. Appert returned several minutes later with a stern reminder to forget about Syracuse erasing Rochester’s three-goal lead in a span of 19:44.
Another opportunity to stave off elimination for a third consecutive game arrived midway through overtime when the Crunch took a delay-of-game penalty. Afterward, Sabres prospect Isak Rosen recalled Amerks assistant coach Michael Peca telling everyone who took the ice for the power play: “You’ve got this now.”
Moments later, defenseman Lawrence Pilut sent a wrist shot into the net to clinch a 5-4 win. For the second year in a row, the Amerks are among the final eight teams remaining in the Calder Cup Playoffs. They will travel to Toronto to play the Marlies in Game 1 on Thursday night.
“To be honest, I didn’t even see it go in in the moment,” said Sabres prospect Tyson Kozak, a seventh-round draft pick who scored the game’s opening goal. “I was just sitting there and everybody stood up and everybody just went crazy, but I really can’t put into words the feeling. It was phenomenal, especially overtime, Game 5, do or die. It’s just incredible.”
This is the sort of scenario Kevyn Adams envisioned when he took over as the Sabres’ general manager in June 2020 and hired Appert to replace Chris Taylor, who, despite leading Rochester to consecutive playoff appearances, was among the 22 employees let go when Adams took over for Jason Botterill.
The Amerks would no longer be filled with expensive veterans blocking prospects from ice time. Adams challenged Appert to transform Rochester into an organization that resembles the USA Hockey National Team Development Program, where Appert coached before accepting the job. Later, he was joined by Peca and assistant coach Mike Weber. Jason Karmanos, who joined the Sabres as associate general manager, worked with Appert to build the roster.
There was a focus on adding veterans who wouldn’t prioritize their self-interests over those of the team. Michael Mersch, now Rochester’s captain, was among Appert’s finds. West Seneca’s Sean Malone and defenseman Ethan Prow joined the group later. Fans snickered when Adams initially laid out the plan because they wondered if this was a cost-cutting move that would make winning impossible in the AHL.
It has been an overwhelming success since the start of the 2021-22 season. The Amerks’ improbable playoff run last spring earned them a trip to the third round for the first time in 18 years, and they accomplished the feat again Saturday night by completing a comeback few expected after their second consecutive loss to Syracuse two weeks ago.
Jack Quinn, JJ Peterka and Peyton Krebs used the experience of postseason hockey to prepare to be impact players with the Sabres. Others showed they can be capable NHLers, including Casey Fitzgerald, who joined the Florida Panthers on waivers in January.
The coaching and development staffs have successfully prepared players to contribute in Buffalo. With more prospects arriving next season, the Sabres have created a feeder program that will be crucial as their top players become more expensive. Every contender needs young players on entry-level contracts to contribute because of the salary cap.
By eliminating the Crunch, the Amerks became the first team since Grand Rapids in 2015, and 12th in league history, to win a best-of-five series after trailing 2-0. Pilut’s goal will be remembered, like Fitzgerald’s that eliminated Belleville a year ago, but it wouldn’t have been possible without plays that will be forgotten by everyone except the group Appert addressed in Rochester’s locker room.
Malcolm Subban, their goalie authoring a career year at 29 years old, delivered his first of many game-changing saves by extending his left leg to stop Simon Ryfors on a Syracuse power play in the first period. Linus Weissbach was exceptional on that penalty kill and used his speed to force a turnover that led to a scoring chance.
Kozak blocked several shots as the Crunch pushed to try to erase the deficit. Isak Rosen, whom Buffalo drafted in the first round two years ago, absorbed big hits all night while producing a pair of primary assists, including one on the game-winner. And the moment that stuck with Appert as he spoke to reporters afterward: defenseman Jeremy Davies laying out to block a slap shot in overtime.
This group didn’t start strong this season. Young forwards were struggling to adapt to the physical nature of the AHL. The defense depth was hit hard by promotions to Buffalo because of injuries to the Sabres’ blue line. Gradually, Rochester began to show the same blend of snarl and skill that made them successful last spring. Those qualities are among the reasons why hundreds of fans made the drive from Rochester to Syracuse and gathered around the hallway leading to the locker room to chant before warmups, “Let’s go Amerks!”
“They’ve earned that love from this fan base because of the heart and the character and the tenacity this group has come to play with now,” said Appert. “I really love coaching this team. They’ve grown so much. Last year’s team was fabulous too, but last year’s team even started better. This year’s team had to grow into this, and I’ve really come to love the grit and the togetherness and the love of being Amerks that these guys play with.”
Almost every player on the roster, no matter their pedigree, is delivering impactful performances in meaningful games. There’s a winning culture in Rochester, in addition to a development model that’s preparing players for the NHL.
Jiri Kulich, a top prospect of the Sabres, scored his third goal in as many playoff games Saturday night and could have added another in overtime. He’s learning from the success and failure of postseason hockey, building off a regular season in which he became the first 18-year-old in the AHL with 20 goals in a campaign since Robert Dome in 1997-98 and fourth in league history
Rosen overcame a rocky start to the series to be one of their best forwards in the elimination games. Weissbach and Lukas Rousek showed how much they have improved during their second season in Rochester. Kozak has become one of their best defensive players and penalty-killers. Malone won a key faceoff on Kozak’s goal. Mersch scored the goal that put Rochester ahead 4-1 in the second period.
And there’s more lessons to be learned. Game 1 of the North Division final is Thursday night in Toronto against the first-place Marlies.
“We did it and it feels amazing,” said Rosen.

310,Kyle Schwarber helps Phillies snap six-game skid,https://www.mlb.com/news/kyle-schwarber-helps-phillies-snap-six-game-skid,"Paul Casella
PHILADELPHIA -- Kyle Schwarber entered Sunday afternoon's series finale against the Red Sox having gone nearly a week without a hit. He had gone more than two weeks without a multi-hit game -- and more than a month without a multi-RBI effort.
He snapped all of those streaks -- and helped the Phillies end a six-game skid of their own -- in a 6-1 win at Citizens Bank Park.
Bumped down to the No. 5 spot in the order, Schwarber struck out in the second inning to extend his slump to an 0-for-21 with nine strikeouts. He walked back to the first-base dugout to a smattering of boos from the sold-out crowd.
#RingTheBell pic.twitter.com/bFDCmiKoo6
Those boos turned to cheers two innings later when Schwarber roped a 98.3 mph RBI single into right field to plate Bryce Harper. Those cheers then became boisterous two more innings later when Schwarber welcomed left-handed reliever Richard Bleier to the game by smashing a 110.8 mph, 434-foot home run to the second deck in right field.
“It feels good,” Schwarber said. “There's definitely a level of frustration whenever you go through things like that.”
Schwarber entered the series finale slashing .176/.295/.376 (.671 OPS), but the frustration had certainly been building over the last few weeks, in particular.
His two hits on Sunday marked his first multi-hit game since April 21 against the Rockies. The three RBIs were a season high, with his only other multi-RBI game this season coming on April 4 at Yankee Stadium.
And it all came on a day when Schwarber was hitting outside of the top three spots in the lineup for the first time since May 27, 2022.
""Maybe it jumpstarts them both,"" manager Rob Thomson said before the game of swapping Schwarber and Bryson Stott, who went 1-for-4 in his return to the leadoff spot. 
Thomson then joked after the game: ""He really feels comfortable in the five-hole.""
Schwarber, however, truly does feel comfortable just about anywhere in the lineup.
Though he primarily hit leadoff last season, Schwarber has more than 100 career plate appearances at every spot from first to sixth. He has more than 300 plate appearances hitting first, second, fourth, fifth or sixth -- and at least 20 home runs out of each of those five spots in the lineup.
“A spot's a spot, for me,” Schwarber said. “I'm going to hit wherever they want me to hit.”
Given Schwarber’s recent slump, Thomson had been faced with plenty of questions over the past week about using the two-time All-Star in the leadoff spot. It was reminiscent of last year's postseason, when Schwarber went 1-for-20 (.050) with eight strikeouts atop the order over the club's first six playoff games.
In the seventh game, Schwarber went 2-for-3 with one home run, one walk and one strikeout in Game 1 of the National League Championship Series in San Diego -- the same exact line he turned in Sunday in Philadelphia.
Schwarber's breakout game in the NLCS kicked off a stretch in which he went 11-for-35 (.314) with six homers over the final 11 games of the 2022 postseason.
The Phillies are hoping Sunday triggers a similar turnaround.
“Confidence is a huge thing for all these guys,” Thomson said. “You start getting your timing down, seeing the ball a little bit better, keeping your head still -- things can turn quickly.""
Schwarber is no stranger to quick turnarounds following slow starts. Entering Sunday, he had a .204 career batting average and .736 OPS prior to June. From June 1 on, he’s a career .244 hitter to go along with an .873 OPS. His home run rate also jumps from 4.9% in those first two months to 6.7% the rest of the year.

“I hate it. I wish that I didn't [start slow]. But it is what it is,” Schwarber said. “I can promise you guys that, whenever I do step out there, I'm taking my best step forward -- and so is everyone else in this clubhouse whenever we step on that field.”
Schwarber’s best game to date backed what was also Taijuan Walker’s best start yet with Philadelphia. The right-hander allowed just one run off three hits over six innings to go with six strikeouts and no walks to earn his first home win as a Phillie.
It was exactly what the Phillies needed to snap a six-game skid heading into Monday’s off-day ahead of a two-game series against another American League East foe in the Blue Jays. 
“Great to get a win. Obviously, I think that's more important,” Schwarber said. “Get off that little streak we had there, and hopefully, take that momentum going into the next series.”",1

This 1976 file photo shows Oakland A's Vida Blue, the hard-throwing left-hander who became one of baseball's biggest draws in the early 1970's and helped lead brash Oakland Athletics to three straight World Series titles. Blue has died. He was 73. The A's said Blue died Saturday, May 6, 2023 but did not give a cause of death.
Vida Blue, a left-handed pitcher who helped lead the Oakland Athletics to three World Series championships in a row from 1972 to 1974 and made six All-Star teams, died Saturday at age 73, according to his family and Major League Baseball. 
The franchise did not announce a cause of death. 
""It is with great sadness that the Blue family mourn the passing of our beloved father Vida Blue,"" the family said in a statement shared by the Oakland Athletics. ""Vida was a great father, grandfather, brother, friend, and teammate who will be forever cherished, honored, and loved.""
Blue was picked in the second round of the 1967 Major League Baseball draft, and made his major league debut at the age of 19 in 1969. In his first two seasons, Blue played 18 games, but found his spark in 1970 when he threw a no-hitter against the Kansas City Royals, becoming the youngest player to do so since the Live Ball Era began in 1920, according to MLB. 
The following year, he had a 24-8 season with a 1.82 earned run average and 301 strikeouts over 312 innings. He won the AL Cy Young and MVP Awards, becoming the fifth player in history to win both honors in the same year. 
""There are few players with a more decorated career than Vida Blue,"" the Oakland Athletics said. ""Vida will always be a franchise legend and a friend. We send our deepest condolences to his family and friends during this time."" 
Blue was born in Mansfield, Louisiana, on July 28, 1949 to Vida Blue Sr. and Sallie Blue. He was the oldest of six.
In high school, Blue played both baseball and football, as a quarterback, but ultimately chose to pursue baseball after his father's death. 
He was with the Athletics for nine seasons before being traded to the San Francisco Giants in 1978. By that time, he had made three All-Star teams, and made three more with the Giants. 
He was traded to the Kansas City Royals in March 1982 and released from the team that August. In December of that year, he was sentenced to three months in prison for possession of cocaine. He was suspended by the league and missed the 1984 season. 
After returning to the sport, he was reinstated by the Giants from 1985 to 1986, and then shortly played with the A's again after becoming a free agent, but retired in 1987. 
Ultimately, Blue finished his 17-year career with a 209-161 record, a 3.27 ERA, 2,175 strikeouts, 143 complete games and 37 shutouts over about 3,300 innings, according to MLB.

312,Lakers: LeBron James shares reaction to Bronny committing to USC - Silver Screen and Roll,https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2023/5/7/23714702/lebron-james-bronny-reaction-usc-college-commitment-nba-lakers,"Filed under:
Bronny James’ commitment to USC on Saturday was a celebratory moment for LeBron and moved his dream of playing with his son in the NBA one step closer.
Saturday was a banner day for the James family, or James Gang as LeBron tends to call them. Early in the day, Bronny announced his commitment to USC for what will likely be his only year of college basketball.
And while the day culminated with LeBron James and the Lakers going up 2-1 on the Warriors in the second round of the playoffs, the biggest news of the day was Bronny’s decision. After Game 3, LeBron spoke about the emotions of the day and noted how monumental the achievement was.
“First of all, congratulation to my son on his next journey and picking a great university, USC. I’m proud of him,” LeBron said. “This is an incredible thing. I think I told (Lakers reporter) Mike (Trudell) after the game, unless it was one of my great grandmothers or great grandfathers or somebody that was way before my time, to my knowledge, this is the first one out of the James Gang to go to college. Obviously, his dad didn’t go to school. His mom didn’t go to college. I think my mom maybe stepped on campus a little bit, maybe a community college or something. But she had my little a-- running around so she couldn’t spend much time in the classroom at 19 years old. She couldn’t do that. I was three. 
“So, it’s very, very, very, very exciting, very humbling and a great moment for our family. It’s super cool. He’s a great kid. University is getting a great kid. Obviously, he’s there to play basketball but they’re going to be super surprised at how great of a kid he is even though they’ve been recruiting him for quite a while.”
There’s maybe a bit of a caveat in that LeBron didn’t go to college, because he could immediately step into the NBA and be an All-Star caliber player. Realistically, he could have stepped onto any campus in the country.

But that’s not the point and doesn’t diminish the accomplishment in any way. It is a banner moment that should be celebrated accordingly.
It’s also a step forward in LeBron’s goal of playing alongside his son. It’s been his long-desired goal, and one that is coming closer and closer to fruition. Assuming Bronny is a one-and-done, there will be just one more season before they would potentially play in the league together.
What once felt like a bit of a pipe dream is now on the brink of becoming reality. During his postgame press conference on Saturday, LeBron was asked if he truly believed he could one day play in the NBA with his son.
“No, I was serious. And I’m still serious about it,” LeBron said. “Obviously, I have to continue keeping my body and my mind fresh, I think my mind most importantly. I think if my mind go, my body will just be like ‘Okay, what’re we doing?’ But at the end of the day...I’ve done what I had to do in this league and my son is going to take his journey. And whatever his journey, however his journey lays out, he’s going to do what’s best for him. As his dad and his mom Savannah and his brother and sister, we’re going to support him in whatever he decides to do. Just because it’s my aspiration and my goal doesn’t mean it’s his. 
“And I’m absolutely okay with that. My job is to support my son in whatever he wants to do. I support my youngest son Bryce, I support my daughter Zhuri in whatever they want to do and go from there. One thing about being a parent, it’s not always about what you want, it’s about listening to your kids and what they want. That’s when you get a real relationship with them.”
It’s been said multiple times, but it can’t be said enough how great of a father LeBron is. Everything about that quote is fantastic.
There are some greater questions to be asked about whether his goal is to still play on the same team as his son or just in the league with him, but the fact that is now the debate and not whether any of it’s even possible is incredible and another testament to LeBron’s longevity.

313,Street Fighter 6 Open Beta Test announced for next week,https://www.eventhubs.com/news/2023/may/08/street-fighter-6-open-beta/,"


With the recent arrival of the Street Fighter 6 Demo, many players were left wondering if there was going to be any more time to try out the game online before release (with some apparent teasers from the developers), but we have the answer to that now.

    
                
                    






Capcom just announced the Open Beta Test for SF6, which will be hitting the streets in just over a week from now.
Like the previous closed beta sessions, SF6's first open beta is going to be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC via Steam, but no PlayStation 4 version it seems like we got for the demo.

The open beta is set to kick off next Friday, May 19, at midnight PDT / 3 a.m. EDT and run through May 21 at the same time.

Those who got to try out the previous betas should find a basically identical experience here in terms of content in presumably the last test of SF6 before release.

That unfortunately means, however, there is still only the same 8 playable characters included like before with Ryu, Chun-Li, Ken, Guile, Juri, Luke, Jamie and Kimberly making up the available roster.
The new open beta also includes character creation for Battle Hub, Ranked Matches, Casual Matches, Open Tournaments, Battle Hub matches, Training Mode, the Hub Goods Shop, Extreme Battles, the Game Center, daily challenges and the DJ booth.
Console players should not need an online subscription like PlayStation Plus to play the SF6 beta online, but there doesn't seem to be confirmation if it's going to be running through the same game client as before or if players will have to download a new one.
There also doesn't appear to be any balance or system changes mentioned on the official page for the open beta compared to how things were in the second closed beta.
Players can pre-download the open beta client starting May 16 at midnight PDT, and players will need a Capcom ID to participate.
You can check out the announcement trailer for Street Fighter 6's open beta below.
You've all been asking!Play the Open Beta for #StreetFighter6 from May 19-21. Experience the content from Closed Beta Test #2, including 8 characters and various ways to play online!🌐 https://t.co/cUsf8PXM5j pic.twitter.com/HhlqCDCCA4",1
314,Google I/O 2023: how to watch and what to expect - The Verge,https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/8/23712615/google-io-2023-what-to-expect-time-date-streaming,"By  Emma Roth
Google I/O is almost here, and that means the launch of the highly anticipated Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet is right around the corner. While the annual conference is largely geared toward developers, the company always holds a keynote revealing the latest and greatest things that’ll wind up in consumers’ hands.
If you want to watch the keynote live but aren’t attending the event, here’s all the information about when and where you can stream it, as well as what you can expect.
The main Google I/O 2023 keynote kicks off on May 10th, 2023, at 1PM ET / 10AM PT and will feature remarks from Google CEO Sundar Pichai. This year, the event will take place in person with a limited live audience at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, California.
There are several places where you can watch the keynote online, including from Google’s website, Google’s YouTube channel, and through the video embedded at the very top of this post. If you aren’t around to watch the stream live, you can always watch a recorded version of the event on YouTube after the fact.
With all that out of the way, here are some of the things we expect Google to announce during the event.
Google’s first foldable has long been rumored to be in the works, but Google surprised us all by making it official last week. The company posted an image and video of the Pixel Fold, which shows a device that folds horizontally, like a book. 
While Google didn’t reveal any details about its specifications, a previous report from CNBC suggests that the device could feature a 5.8-inch display when closed shut and a 7.6-inch screen when unfolded, the same size as Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 4.
Under the hood, the Pixel Fold is expected to use Google’s Tensor G2, the system on a chip used by Pixel 7-series devices. Like the other foldables on the market, the Pixel Fold probably won’t come cheap. According to CNBC, it could cost upwards of $1,700.
The Google Pixel Tablet is another device that we’ve long been waiting for, with Google first revealing the Android-powered tablet at its I/O conference in 2022. While the initial images of the device didn’t make its design look particularly promising, recent leaks show a tablet that fits in with the rest of the Pixel ecosystem, available in an array of color options.
Google previously said that the tablet will come with an included charging dock and speaker that lets you use the device like a smart display, such as the Amazon Echo Show. The latest rumors from 9to5Google also indicate that it could come with Google’s Tensor G2 chip, Android 13, 8GB of RAM, a nanoceramic finish, and feature an 11-inch display. 
An early Pixel Tablet listing on Amazon (which has since been removed) corroborates these rumors, but it also indicates that the device could come with two 8-megapixel cameras on its front and back, three microphones, up to 256GB of storage, and USI 2.0 stylus support. We still don’t know how much the Pixel Tablet will cost, though. Rumors point to between €600 to €650 in Europe, but Google’s European prices are sometimes higher than those in the US.
The Google Pixel 7A has been leaked several times over the past several months, and at this point, it’s almost inevitable that it will make an appearance at I/O. Not only did we get a look at a new sky-blue color option, but we also saw the box that the device will come packaged in. Heck, someone even managed to get their hands on the Pixel 7A in March.
Some of the device’s rumored specs include a Tensor G2 chip, an upgraded 64MP main camera, and a 13MP ultrawide camera. It could also launch with two features never before seen with Google’s budget-friendly A-series devices: a 90Hz refresh rate and support for wireless charging. These upgrades come with a bit of a tradeoff, though, as rumors suggest it could cost $50 more than the Pixel 6A at $499.
We’re bound to hear more at Google I/O about Android 14, which features some enhancements for foldables, tablets, and devices with larger screens — a perfect fit for the event introducing the Pixel Fold. The beta for Android 14 is already out, with Google rolling out the first version of the operating system last month.
Since then, Google has been gradually adding new features to Android 14, like a new back arrow that blends with your background, passkey support, improved battery life, and more control over your privacy in your device’s media library. Android 14 is also expected to add improved font scaling ahead of its public rollout later this year.
In addition to the potential launch of the Pixel 7A, Google might also give us a glimpse at the upcoming Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro, just like it did with the Pixel 7 during last year’s I/O. Google isn’t expected to officially launch the device until the fall, so it’s entirely possible the company will skip an early preview and instead keep the focus on new devices like the Fold. But if Google does show something, we already know a little bit about what to expect.
Leaked renders from Smartprix and OnLeaks reveal a redesigned camera bar on the Pixel 8 Pro that includes all three cameras in a single oval cutout. There’s also a sensor located beneath the flash that Smartprix believes could be a macro or depth sensor. The renders of the standard Pixel 8, however, show a camera setup similar to the one on the Pixel 7.
The Pixel 8 Pro is expected to come with a 6.52-inch display with more rounded corners, a hole-punch selfie camera, and 12GB of RAM, while the regular Pixel 8 will feature a 6.2-inch screen with 8GB of RAM. Another finding from 9to5Google indicates that the Pixel 8 series could come with an exclusive Video Unblur tool to sharpen videos.
With the launch of Google’s ChatGPT rival Bard, Google has gone all in on AI, and it’s likely that Google will use up a chunk of its I/O keynote to make some sort of AI-related announcements. 
Internal documents obtained by CNBC indicate that Google’s preparing an AI-heavy presentation, which will include the launch of PaLM 2, the latest version of the company’s large language model (LLM) that supports over 100 different languages. The company recently said that it’s testing generative AI tools in Workspace, starting with Docs and Gmail, but CNBC’s report suggests that Google will use I/O to announce that it’s expanding those features to Sheets and Slides. 
Google could announce some enhancements to Bard as well. In addition to letting you use the bot to generate, debug, and explain lines of code, the company will reportedly reveal “generative experiences” across Bard and search that involve coding, math, and “logic” while adding support for Japanese and Korean languages. This also tracks with reports that Google will release new AI-powered search tools sometime this month.
It’s always possible that Google could reveal a wildcard product, like an update to the Pixel Watch. And a new color of the Pixel Buds A-series seems to be on the table. But with the launch of the Pixel Tablet and Pixel Fold, Google will have a pretty exciting event as it is. 
The company is more likely to sprinkle some smaller announcements in between its hardware launches, like updates to Maps, Photos, and Google Assistant. It may even have some news to share about its smart home products as it continues to add new features to its Google Home app.
If you want to stay up to date on Google’s latest announcements, make sure to stay tuned to our Google I/O storystream.
Update May 8th, 5:34PM ET: Updated to add additional information about Google’s expected AI announcements.

315,What do you want from Pixel Watch 2?,https://9to5google.com/2023/05/08/pixel-watch-2-poll/,"After introducing its first smartwatch last year, Google is now preparing a “Pixel Watch 2” to be unveiled later this year as we exclusively reported on Friday. What do you want to see changed?
The original Pixel Watch was a mixed bag. It had a solid health suite built on top of Fitbit, a striking design that remains very unique, but it also had arguably poor battery life, fairly thick bezels on the display, and a very old chipset that led to inconsistent performance on the whole.
Still, it was a much better foundation for Google-made smartwatches than we expected, as brought out in our review last year. 
The quote that’s kept coming back to me through the leaks and even now as I’ve spent the better part of two weeks with Google’s first smartwatch is MJ’s line from Spider-Man: No Way Home: “Expect disappointment, and you’ll never be disappointed.” I went into the testing process with the Pixel Watch with low expectations, and frankly, I’m not unhappy with this smartwatch. 
Obviously, there’s a lot of room for improvement from that, and that’s exactly what the Pixel Watch 2 – or whatever it might be called – is such an exciting possibility.
So far, we don’t know anything that Google has planned for its next smartwatch, but there are some obvious areas to improve on.
Smaller bezels, two sizes (40mm and 44mm), standardised strap connectors (until now we still don't know what does pogo pin contacts do), standardised Qi Charging (enough with the inverted-magnetic-proprietary charging already) and working sensors (until now the SpO2 sensor is still not activated).

but I do agree, always expect disappointment in every product that Google produces, both hardware and software.
One of the easiest things to improve on the Pixel Watch 2 that would have a major impact on the product as a whole is its chipset. The Exynos 9110 in the current model is very outdated, especially when it comes to efficiency. Upgrading to the Exynos W920 found in the Galaxy Watch 4 and Watch 5 would do wonders to both performance and battery life. Of course, the Snapdragon W5+ seems like an even better contender, but it seems unlikely Google would team up with Qualcomm given its tight partnership with Samsung on Tensor. Personally, a new chip is the only upgrade I want to see – leave the rest as is.
Another area it seems a lot of folks want Google to improve on is the design, specifically with the sequel thinning out the bezels and increasing the display size. Google could also bring a second size for the Pixel Watch this time around, which was a popular request during the first generation. That seems unlikely, though, given Google’s proprietary band design.
There’s also plenty of room to improve support for health sensors, as the first-generation Pixel Watch is still lacking some important functions such as SpO2.
But what do you want to see most from a Pixel Watch 2? Vote in the poll below, and let’s discuss in the comments!

GitHub has announced the general availability of a ground-up rework of its code search that has been in development for years.
The changes include substantial new functionality that is significantly more aware of context. The company says its new code search is ""about twice as fast"" as the old code search and that it ""understands code, putting the most relevant results first.""
That's on top of redesigned search and code view interfaces. The new search interface offers suggestions and completions and categorizes and formats the results more intelligently.
Within the code view, you can easily see references in a side panel, more or less matching what you'd be able to do in Visual Studio when it comes to looking up and navigating to references. Substring queries, regular expressions, and symbol search are also supported.

This overhaul was first made available as a technology preview with a waitlist in December 2021. Those who opted in and were offered the new search spent a long time using it alongside the old code search as a separate tool.
If you want to go way deeper in understanding it, you can check out the GitHub engineering blog's February 2023 post detailing exactly how it works, which technologies were used to build it, and so on.
The changes are meant to improve productivity for software developers—for example, the new search could be much more efficient for finding specific vulnerabilities in a large codebase.
As noted, the change has been in the works for a while, but GitHub is positioning it as part of a larger initiative to bring more intelligence to the platform. The other most notable bullet point in that initiative is the enrichening and expansion of the AI coding tool Copilot leveraging generative AI.

317,Next-gen Apple Watch will reportedly get its first major CPU upgrade in years | Ars Technica,https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/next-gen-apple-watch-will-reportedly-get-its-first-major-cpu-upgrade-in-years/,"Front page layout

Technically, each year's Apple Watch includes a processor upgrade. The Apple Watch Series 8 comes with an Apple S8 processor, which is a larger number than the S7 SoC that came with the Series 7 or the S6 that came with the Series 6.
However, none of those processors has actually provided much by way of a performance upgrade; they all seem to use an identical processor with a CPU architecture based on the Apple 13 (presumably the small, energy-efficient cores) and a 7 nm manufacturing process from TSMC.
Bloomberg's Mark Gurman (via MacRumors) says this year will be different. He says the next-generation chip (presumably the Apple S9) will be a more substantial upgrade than the last few, with a new processor based on the same architecture used in Apple's newer A15 chip. And if the CPU is changing, Apple could also take the opportunity to upgrade the manufacturing process, potentially providing a boost in battery life (and other features) along with an increase in speed.
A new chip would likely be the most interesting thing about the next-generation Apple Watch's hardware; Gurman doesn't expect major design changes for the watch this year, and we can probably expect it to look about the same as every Apple Watch introduced since 2018's Series 4 design increased the screen sizes. Gurman expects a fairly substantial overhaul for the watchOS software this year, though, with a revamped user interface centered on iOS-style widgets.
The benefit of keeping the processor relatively unchanged for so many years is that a newer watchOS should run equally well on several generations' worth of watch hardware rather than requiring the latest and greatest chip to shine. It's too early to tell whether the watchOS 10 update will drop any older models; watchOS 9 put the Apple Watch Series 3 out of its misery, though not before updating its software became a major pain.

318,One Of The Best PC Game Sales Of The Year Is Live Now - GameSpot,https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-the-best-pc-game-sales-of-the-year-is-live-now/1100-6513915/,"The massive Fanatical May Madness Sale discounts thousands of PC games, many of which are down to their lowest prices yet.
By 
    Darryn Bonthuys
   on May 8, 2023 at 12:32PM PDT
Fanatical never has a shortage of game deals, but its  May Madness promotion  is always one of its biggest and best offerings. It features a massive collection of discounted games, including recent releases and plenty of big-game games that you may have missed out on previously. Most of the thousands of games that are on sale come as Steam keys, though there are some titles, such as Ubisoft games, that utilize different DRM.
As an added bonus, spending $12 or more will earn you a spin on the Fanatical Wheel, earning you a coupon that can be redeemed on your next order or even a free game. There'll be flash deals every day, so don't forget to check in every 24 hours to see which games are on special.
Some of the highlights of this event include  Mortal Kombat 11: Ultimate,  a gloriously gory entry in the brutal fighting game series. It has a terrific story, fatalities that'll make you hurl and you can play as some of Hollywood's greatest legends. Ever stayed up at night wondering if Rambo could carve up Sub-Zero in a one-on-one fight? Well, wonder no more.
For horror fans, don't miss out on the recent remakes of  Resident Evil 2  and  3.  Resident Evil 2 is the gem of the bunch, while Resident Evil 3 is a shorter and more action-orientated return to Racoon City. Both games look fantastic, feature updated gameplay, and are very replayable. Plus, they are playable on Steam Deck.
The  Batman: Arkham Collection  is another solid buy, bundling up the best versions of the games in Rocksteady's legendary dark knight trilogy. Each one of these titles is the GOTY edition, and Batman: Arkham Knight is worth the price of admission alone as it includes an absurd amount of content through its season pass.
In the mood for some anime action? Check out  Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot,  which puts a fun spin on Goku's adventures. It has eye-popping visuals, a fun grind as you gain more power, and fights that can split reality in two. For something weirder, there's Hideo Kojima's  Death Stranding.  Part hiking simulator in the post-apocalypse, part courier simulator, and all WTF, it's a strange but haunting look at a world on the edge of extinction.
There's also a few recent releases in this special, and now that some time has passed for them to get patched up, they might be worth considering.  Gotham Knights  is a competent action sandbox,  Tales of Arise  is an enchanting action-RPG, and  Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection  is all the charm of the GBA classics ported over to modern systems. For more, you can check out the full list below.

319,Here’s the new Google Play Books logo,https://9to5google.com/2023/05/08/google-play-books-new-logo/,"Following new icons for the Play Store and Play Games, it’s now time for Google Play Books to get a new logo, while a tablet redesign is also in development.
To celebrate turning 10 in 2022, Google Play got a new logo with updated colors and tweaked spacing. Similarly, Google Play Games for PC launched with a new icon that came to the Android app earlier this year.
The new icon keeps the triangle shape but rounds the three points much more significantly. Like with Play Games, there’s no longer anything protruding from the triangle, with the book removed. Instead, you just get a bookmark to convey the app’s purpose.
Meanwhile, a darker shade of blue is used, like Play Games, in a refreshing step back from Google app icons that mostly share the same color scheme.
Given that the triangle motif is retained, Google is most likely keeping the “Play Books” name rather than rebranding. There is audiobook support, but otherwise you don’t really “play” a book when reading.
Besides the new logo, which is not yet live but visible in Google Takeout of all places, Play Books is working on a straightforward tablet redesign that implements a navigation drawer. Currently, there’s just a wide bottom bar on Android tablets. We do not currently see Material You elements, save for the widget, in place in a trajectory that matches the Google TV app.

My Nintendo News
E3 was meant to be going ahead earlier this year but was naturally canceled when the major video game publishers, and console manufacturers, decided they would rather do their own thing. Fans were still hoping that Nintendo were planning a Nintendo Direct presentation for June 2023 to show what is on the horizon after The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom launches on Friday. Now Andy Robinson from VGC and journalist Jeff Grubb have stated that they haven’t heard anything regarding a Nintendo Direct in June. As we all know, Nintendo always does the unexpected, so they can hold a Direct whenever they feel fit. 
I also heard a Sony Showcase is happening in the usual late May / early June window, with Konami stuff included. I’m not expecting Nintendo to do anything
I'm with Andy. I expect a series of smaller tweets and YouTube drops if anything, but –unlike last year — that's just speculation. https://t.co/LscgMCVxVb
I mean yeah they didn’t drop anything last year fr but the difference between last year and this year is that they already had a good lineup so there wasn’t a huge need for a direct Ubisoft did there own thing for m+r cause it was consider third party, xeno and 3 hopes also came out around the same time and the shadow drops were literally just dlc for mk8 and etc, the only thing Nintendo has left is tears of kingdom and Pikmin 4, so I’m pretty sure we’re gonna here something, they did give us a partner showcase direct last summer focusing on 3rd party so who knows.
It feels like things are lining things up for the next console what with the Switch being 6 years old now and Nintendo being hush hush with future projects now. I wouldn’t be surprised if Metroid Prime 4 ends up being a cross release like BoTW was at this point.
I’m not gonna say this year is going to be huge for Nintendo, I believe this year is going to be quite different since E-3 is cancelled entirely. I’m hoping for the best for other consoles manufacturers.
Well this was always expected, onwards to September 😁
The speculation has been Nintendo do not have a lot lined up for the second half of the year beyond Pikmin 4. I hope that’s not true, but obviously the vibes aren’t feeling great. Still, Zelda and Pikmin to come, we can worry about the rest after that!
Seems obvious.  We have TOTK in a few days and then Pikmin 4 soon after.  No need to hype your audience up on future games when they are enjoying a few long-awaited titles.  Perhaps the only logical thing Ninty can do is to give an update on previously announced titles… which really just means an update on Prime 4.  If they drop that Prime 4 is releasing at the end of the year… oh lawd.  Banger year for Switch releases.
On to September…. yeeehaw.
Jeff Grubb may need to stop these crazy rumors before he continues to get bashed by viewers, because that rumor is a cold lie. Nintendo has already confirmed a Nintendo Direct for June.
in case i missed something nintendo has not congormed a direct for june? do you have a source for that statement?
I do have a source, but I’m not allowed to give that information out.
So your source is literally “just trust me bro”?
It can be whatever you believe, at least my info is legit and not a ramble for clicks and views like Jeff Grubb.
No they haven’t. The closest thing is Nintendo live, it’s not a direct as it’s an in person event usually with music. It’s also not in June, it’s at the start of September.
Ok, that’s your choice not to believe me, I’m not debating on my actual source. But they will be holding a Nintendo direct in June.
As disappointing as it would be, I could easily see Nintendo skipping Summer in favor of showing off/out in tandem with the live show in August; of course I could be wrong about that as well.
I just hop Nintendo announces SOMETHING because after Tears of the Kingdom and Pikmen 4, it’s looking quite slim for the rest of the year 1st party releases
Live show is Sept 1st-4th
The Super Mario Bros. Movie has made over $1.1 billion, Zelda Tears of the kingdom is the best game for years to come. Pikmin 4 is on the horizon; we have Metroid prime remaster. We gamers know Nintendo is going to deliver this year and beyond ☕️.
F=ma.
I wouldn’t be surprised if they’re not gonna have a Direct next month.The rest of this year after Tears of The Kingdom and Pikmin 4 could be a more quiet one.

322,Rapper Mike D's childhood pad finds buyer after price chop,https://nypost.com/2023/05/08/rapper-mike-ds-childhood-pad-finds-buyer-after-price-chop/,"

		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	
Beastie Boys’ Mike D’s childhood home at the famed Eldorado on Manhattan’s Upper West Side will have a new owner. 
The Central Park West stunner just went into contract following a roughly $4.5 million price chop. The sprawling six-bedroom duplex co-op with picture-perfect views of Central Park and the Reservoir was last asking $14.99 million — down from its initial ask of $19.5 million last year. Maintenance fees are $22,300 a month. 
The seller is the estate of Hester Diamond, the late art collector, interior designer and mother of Mike D, otherwise known as Michael Diamond. Past residents of the building have included Bruce Willis, Alec Baldwin, Ron Howard and Bono. 
A former social worker, Hester moved in with Mike D’s father Harold, a teacher, in the 1960s as renters. They eventually bought their home and expanded it while moving into the art-world business full time. After Harold’s death, Hester remarried and lived at the Eldorado for more than 50 years before her own death at age 91 in 2020. A year later, in 2021, her art collection was auctioned at Sotheby’s for $26.7 million, according to reports. 
At 6,300 square feet, the unit — at 300 Central Park West, between West 90th and 91st streets — comes with 800 square feet of wrap terraces, including 130 linear feet overlooking Central Park. All of the main rooms open to the terrace. 
The apartment opens on the 19th floor to a foyer that leads to a 29-foot-long living room. Details include a main hall to display art, a formal dining room with herringbone floors — and an eat-in, windowed chef’s kitchen. 
The hall leads to the main bedroom suite, and boasts windows and a door that opens to the terrace. There’s also a curved staircase that opens to a landing surrounded by built-in bookcases and five additional bedrooms. 
One is currently used as a media room with two ensuite baths. In addition, there’s a windowed laundry room and a “staff staircase” that leads to the kitchen. 
Original details include hardwood floors, high ceilings and moldings. 
The building, designed by Emery Roth, features amenities including a doorman, a concierge, lobby attendants, a gym, a half basketball court and a community room. 
Brokers Michael J. Franco of Compass and Amy Katcher of Corcoran declined to comment. ",1
323,Relive Your Childhood Games With This Free CD-ROM Archive,https://lifehacker.com/relive-your-childhood-games-with-this-free-cd-rom-archi-1850408876,"The digital revolution should have made preserving the past easier, but instead, it feels to me like we’ve only lost access. The games and programs we grew up with didn’t grow up with our computers, and now most live only in our memories. Well, unless you know where to find them.
While there may be a host of sources on the web for finding old software, there’s perhaps no collection as complete as The Internet Archive: The non-profit has a collection of CD-ROM files that span decades. As of this article, the archive has just under 46,000 entries, from games to software you might have used growing up in school. Chances are, if you remember it, it’s in here:
This is a wide and variant collection of CD-ROM based software, that is, software that came on a CD-ROM for installation on computers, or played in consoles. Ranging from applications and games to gatherings of public-domain software or clip art, the heyday of the CD-ROM is roughly 1989 to 2001. In all cases, the capacity of the CD-ROM stayed steady at 640-700mb a side, although some used tricks to claim they had more (due to compression, or adding up both sides of two-sided CD-ROMs).
For some reason, the first title that came to mind when thinking back to elementary school games was the JumpStart series, and a simple “JumpStart” search netted 95 results. Next up, I tried “Backyard,” hoping to find the Backyard Sports games I played obsessively as a sports-averse child. Sure enough, there are 29 results, including my two favorites: Backyard Baseball 2003 and Backyard Soccer MLS Edition. 
There are even CD-ROM files from console games, as well. Search for “Harry Potter,” for example, and you’ll find games for not just PC, but for PS2 and Xbox as well. It’s certainly heavy on PC CD-ROMs versus consoles, it’s still worth looking for console games if you have something in mind. 
It doesn’t have everything, so don’t be too disappointed if your search comes up empty, but it might be worth checking out the Internet Archive’s broader CD-ROM Software Collection, which includes both software as well as “shareware” from companies back in the day. This collection features over 71,000 entries, conveniently sorted into dozens of categories. If you really want a trip down memory lane, check out the AOL CD-ROM collection.
As for running these programs on Windows, it might be easier than you think thanks to something called compatibility mode, which simulates a previous Windows OS for the purpose of running software incompatible with Windows 10 or 11. As explained by PCMag, not all games and programs will run through compatibility mode, but if they do, it’s an easy way to check them out without having to jump through any hoops.
All you need to do to run one of these CD-ROM files in compatibility mode is to locate and right-click its .exe file, click “Properties,” then check out the “Compatibility” tab. The fastest way to get started from there is to hit “Run compatibility troubleshooter” or “Try recommended settings” to run the CD-ROM with the right settings.
The Internet Archive has more historical programs for you to check out, as well. My personal favorite is their “Internet Arcade,” a collection of over 2,600 arcade titles you can play in your web browser. When I say arcade, I mean arcade: These games were meant to be played in an arcade cabinet, down to the coin needed to get started. That said, a press of the 5 key will trick the game into thinking you’ve entered a coin. 
For even more programs, head to the Internet Archive’s main site, then hit the Software tab.",1
324,Sony's Towering Party Speaker Can Double As a Standing TV Soundbar,https://gizmodo.com/sony-party-speaker-tv-soundbar-optical-price-standing-1850415455,"Giant party speakers are the easiest way to bring the tunes to wherever your guests are hanging out, but once everyone has gone home, you’re probably not going to drag it around to listen to NPR every morning. They’re usually only rolled out for specific occasions, but Sony’s latest party speaker is useful for more than just parties or karaoke, as it can also be used as a standing soundbar for your TV.
Standing a little over 28-inches tall, the new SRS-XV800 stretches the definition of a portable wireless speaker, but Sony does include a pair of wheels on the bottom so you can simply drag it from room to room without worrying about leaving behind scrape marks. The speaker also features sturdy handles built into the top and the bottom, as it can be used standing on its own, or lifted onto a table and laid on its side—a built-in sensor will determine how it’s being used and adjust the sound output accordingly.
A perfect treeThis magical little tree is a lot of fun to build, has a few customizable parts, and never needs watering to keep it alive. You can water it if you want, but it’s not necessary. 
A built-in rechargeable battery promises up to 25 hours of sound from the SRS-XV800's five tweeters—three on the front and two rear-facing units on the back that help to fill an entire room with sound—which are paired with dual X-Balanced speaker units on the front that help boost bass performance. And because a bumping soundtrack isn’t always enough to get a party in gear, the SRS-XV800 also includes color-changing LED lighting accents that can be synced to the beat of what’s being played.
The SRS-XV800 is first and foremost designed for music, and includes inputs on the back for a guitar so you can use the speaker as an amp, as well as a karaoke input (you supply the microphone) with controls on the back for echo effects and Key Control.
If after a long night of listening to party guests butchering Bohemian Rhapsody, you feel more like watching movies on the couch the next day, the SRS-XV800 includes an optical port and even a bundled optical cable so you can easily connect it to your TV and use the speaker as a standing soundbar. When positioned at the front of a room near a TV, Sony also claims the SRS-XV800's pair of rear-firing tweeters will produce sound that bounces off the nearby wall and better fills the room, but you definitely shouldn’t expect a surround sound experience.
The Sony SRS-XV800 is currently available for pre-order through Sony’s website and other retailers for $649, with shipping and availability expected to start on May 15.

325,Replica iPhone 15 Pro Max Offers Best Look Yet at Ultra-Thin Bezels Around Display - MacRumors,https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/iphone-15-pro-max-ultra-thin-bezels/,"YouTuber Unbox Therapy has shared a hands-on look at the iPhone 15 Pro Max using a one-to-one replica created by third-party case makers with access to early Apple schematics, and by far the most obvious difference is the sheer thinness of the bezels around the display.
The video provides a side-by-side comparison between the iPhone 14 Pro Max and its direct successor, and as Unbox Therapy notes, bezel thinness on the unreleased model looks ""almost half"" the size of those found on its predecessor, potentially offering the best screen-to-bezel ratio of any smartphone. 
Both iPhone 15 Pro models are expected to have thinner, curved bezels compared to the iPhone 14 Pro, resulting in an Apple Watch-like appearance, and rumors suggest the larger 6.7-inch model will have the most minimal of bezels.
According to leaker Ice Universe, the iPhone 15 Pro Max will ""break the record"" of 1.81mm bezels held by the Xiaomi 13, with Apple's upcoming model coming with a bezel width of just 1.55mm at the thinnest edge. For comparison, the iPhone 14 Pro’s bezel measurements are 2.17mm, while the Samsung Galaxy Ultra S23 bezels measure in at 1.95mm.
Unbox Therapy's replica includes the button configuration on the new Pro models as they were originally rumored, with a single unified volume button and an additional software-configurable button in lieu of the mute switch, suggesting the mockup was based on early schematics. 
As rumors stand, the mute switch is still gone but the volume buttons are now believed to be separate on the iPhone 15 Pro models, while the rumored solid-state haptic volume buttons and new Taptic Engine have apparently been delayed until next year's models, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman.

326,8 Surprising Facts About Dead Island 2’s Legendary Gore,https://kotaku.com/ama-reddit-dead-island-2-weapons-flesh-system-ps5-xbox-1850415887,"Despite Dead Island 2’s glamorous outer shell—its sparkling, sprawling vision of L.A., filled with scattered cash and ruined mansions—what makes it compelling is making its many zombies literally spill their guts. As you may have once heard, it’s what’s on the inside that counts. 
So on Friday, Dead Island 2 developer Deep Silver answered questions on Reddit about its procedural “flesh system,” which allows players to shave off zombie parts methodically like digging through ice cream to get to the caramel core, and is directly responsible for the game’s nasty satisfaction. It has its limits, though.
“I’m not sure I’d want to see it on believable human enemies to be honest,” Dambuster Studios technical art director Dan Evans-Lawes said on Reddit about applying the “flesh system” to other video games. “We deliberately kept it zombie-only so we could go super extreme with the gore without it getting too disturbing.”
While Dead Island 2 undoubtedly delights in violence, keeping it unreal and undead helps establish it as a technical and artistic feat. You can be more convinced that it exists for entertainment, as appropriately over-the-top B-movie splatter that wouldn’t necessarily be an ideal fit for every violent video game.
Amazon has dropped the price of this kid-friendly 10-inch WiFi/Bluetooth tablet by a whopping 82%.
Here are eight of the juiciest details (lightly edited for clarity) we learned from Deep Silver’s in-depth ask-me-anything session.

“When I was doing the skin/fat/muscle blending I looked at some real pictures of surgery because you actually get a much clearer look at the structures and colors that way,” Evans-Lawes said, “but in terms of the end results we wanted to achieve, I mainly looked at practical effects in movies such as RoboCop, Starship Troopers, Day of The Dead (and many more).”
“I completely avoided watching anything involving real violence towards real people,” he continued, “partly for my own mental health, but also because our goal was to make the violence so over the top, it was ridiculous and entertaining. We weren’t going for [something] disturbingly realistic.”
“The surface of the flesh is pretty much ‘infinite’ in terms of variation, limited by poly count and texture resolution, basically,” said senior render programmer Aaron Ridge. “Internally, we have many ‘viscera’ chunks, which can be individually destroyed.
The head has some special rules to avoid some chunks floating, so we always have some attachment to the spine remaining. If we dismember or bisect a zombie it always has to be a complete cut; we don’t support making a zombie nearly-headless, although that would be cool.”
“Zombies are built out of a surface mesh and a set of ‘viscera’ meshes,” Ridge said. “The viscera meshes are individual pieces that can be destroyed, or broken. This is a shared asset among zombies, with a few variations on viscera. The viscera itself comes in as one model, but we split up the draw call when we break it apart to attempt to keep draw calls minimal.
“The surface mesh gets deformed and modified as the zombie takes damage. When we do limb dismemberments or bisections, we dynamically split the mesh across a cutting plane, testing each triangle to determine what side it lands on, and then we use the secret ‘Kinder egg man’ technique to close it up and detail the wound.”
“I’ve seen people claim dismemberments are pre-cut, but this is only half true,” he continued. “The viscera which makes up the bones is split into fixed pieces, but the mesh is dynamically cut so the direction and position of the cut can freely change between cuts.”
“The audio team destroyed a lot of vegetables and snapped a lot of spaghetti in order to make all the gory noises in the game,” Evans-Lawes said. “In terms of visual research, we didn’t actually hack any meat to pieces with machetes, but it’s definitely something to try in the future, I think.”
“Hardest part was probably figuring out a way to make holes through the zombies,” Evans-Lawes said. “Our initial implementation had a solid ‘core’ that you couldn’t damage, but we really wanted to be able to blast holes straight through.
Part of this was giving the outer flesh some actual thickness rather than it being a wafer-thin, single-sided mesh, and the other was filling the resulting hole with destructible guts.”
“At one point, there was also talk of freezing zombies, but that one never really made it off the drawing board,” Evans-Lawes said, “partially because we quickly maxed-out the number of textures we could look up in a single zombie material.” But “it would definitely be something I’d like to see,” he said in a later comment. “Who can forget the legendary liquid nitrogen scene from [2001 sci-fi slasher] Jason X?”
“Zombie clothes do burn!” Evans-Lawes responded to a question about Dead Island 2’s lack of nudity, particularly on zombies whose bodies can withstand heat. “However, if you look closely, you will find that zombies do wear perma-pants to protect their modesty.
In the case of [boss character] Butcho the Clown, we had the issue of him regenerating, but it wouldn’t make any sense to regenerate clothes, so in that case, we did actually make the top of his clown trousers indestructible.”
“I think you’d struggle to do just the right amount of damage to expose the bits you’re so eager to see anyway,” Ridge said.
“We’re definitely hearing a lot of love for the idea of adding photo mode,” Ridge said.
“Yeah, it’s been great seeing the community taking all these close-up shots of the detail we put in as we did sometimes wonder whether anyone would actually notice it during gameplay,” said Evans-Lawes. “Can’t promise anything on the photo mode yet, but we hear you!”

327,Samsung's Galaxy Watch will soon be able to alert wearers to irregular heart rhythms | Engadget,https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-galaxy-watch-will-soon-be-able-to-alert-wearers-to-irregular-heart-rhythms-161545939.html,"Samsung has revealed that the US Food and Drug Administration has approved the Health Monitor app's irregular heart rhythm notification (IHGN) feature for Galaxy Watch devices. The company says that, along with the wearable's electrocardiogram (ECG) capabilities, the feature can help to identify signs of atrial fibrillation (AFib), a type of arrhythmia.
AFib is widely believed to be an alarm bell for potentially major cardiovascular issues that can lead to increased risk of stroke, heart failure and other complications. In some cases, those with AFib are asymptomatic. 
The Galaxy Watch's BioActive Sensor will look for irregular heart rhythms in the background after the wearer activates the function in the Samsung Health Monitor app. If the sensor picks up several irregular measurements consecutively, the watch will alert the wearer to possible AFib activity. The notification will suggest that the user takes an ECG reading for a more accurate measurement. If the reading detects signs of AFib, the watch will urge the wearer to consult their doctor.
Except for the original model, every Apple Watch has offered an IHGN feature in certain markets since 2019. Samsung says that availability of its IHGN feature will depend on the market, carrier, model and the paired smartphone.
Samsung will include the IHGN feature in the One UI 5 Watch update. It will first be available on the next lineup of Galaxy Watch devices, which will arrive later this year. Owners of Galaxy Watch 4 series and later models will have access to the feature at a later date. One UI 5 Watch will also introduce new sleep monitoring functions and a personalized heart rate zone feature for workouts.",1

Some of you might remember, for better or worse, the Donkey Kong Country cartoon that made its debut in 1997. The cartoon was a computer-animated musical television series, and it certainly had its moments, but it wasn’t exactly Nintendo-level quality. Still though, plenty of fans still look back on the series with a smile all these decades later.
If you’ve been jonesing for a Donkey Kong Country cartoon fix, we’ve got something that will definitely do the trick. Alex Henderson Animation and Bootleg Dub productions have teamed up for DKC: Return to Krocodile Isle, a spiritual successor to their original fan animation, Curse of the Crystal Coconut! Enjoy!
Best of all, DKC: Return to Krocodile Isle features the return of some voice actors who lent their talents to the original Donkey Kong Country cartoon! If you hear a voice that sounds familiar, you can thank the original actor, or an extremely talented sound-a-like!

330,Microsoft Tests Sticking Ads in Windows 11 Settings Menu,https://gizmodo.com/microsoft-ads-badging-office-365-onedrive-windows-11-1850414970,"Microsoft is treating Windows 11 more and more like a billboard bus, finding ways to stick advertisements for its services along every surface and armpit of its operating system. In addition to ads in the Start menu, the latest test build for Windows 11 includes notices for a Microsoft 365 trial and more in the Settings menu.
On Friday, Windows beta user and routine leaker Albacore shared several screenshots of the latest Insider Preview build 23451. These shots come from the ultra-early Canary test build, and show a new “Home” tab in Settings that includes a notice to “Try Microsoft 365.” This appears to link to a free trial of the company’s office apps suite. There’s also a notice for OneDrive and another to ask users to finish setting up a Microsoft account, advertising users can use the 365 apps and its cloud storage on desktop. Another notice in the Accounts tab also blasts users with a request to sign in to their Microsoft account.
These ads are very similar to other preview builds with so-called “badging” that shows up when users click on the Start menu. In that menu, the ads are more subtle and ask users to “Sign in to your Microsoft account” or advertise to users that they can “Use Microsoft 365 for free,” of course ignoring that users have to input their credit card information to access their free month of office apps.
A perfect treeThis magical little tree is a lot of fun to build, has a few customizable parts, and never needs watering to keep it alive. You can water it if you want, but it’s not necessary. 
Microsoft declined to offer additional comment beyond what was mentioned in its Build 23451 blog post. It’s clear the Redmond, Washington company is seeing how far it can get with ads for its own services inside its OS. Albacore wrote the test Settings page has been hidden “for a few weeks,” though it’s received more of these cards, AKA ads, over the last few builds.
Based solely on the screenshots, it’s unclear if users will be able to disable these ads like they can for the Start menu (by navigating to the Settings menu). This version of the Home tab on the Settings page doesn’t seem to include anything but the ads themselves.
Microsoft has been trying to push its 365 apps recently, with updates that add AI features to apps like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. The company retired the old Office monicker late last year in a rebranding and consolidation effort to fight off Google’s own suite of cloud-based workspace apps.
Windows 11 can already be a hard sell over Windows 10, especially considering how it took Microsoft quite a while to add new features like File Explorer tabs and a native video editor. The problem for Windows 10 holdouts is that Microsoft said it is no longer providing any new feature updates to its earlier OS. In addition, the company won’t provide any new security updates for Home, Pro, Enterprise, and Education versions of Windows 10 starting in October, 2025. Announcing the new client roadmap, product manager Jason Leznek said the company “highly encourage[s]” users transition to Windows 11.
Unfortunately, with all these proposed additions, Microsoft is making that transition a much harder pill to swallow.

   on May 8, 2023 at 10:48AM PDT
A PlayStation Showcase event is coming the week of May 25, according to reporter Jeff Grubb of GameSpot sister site Giant Bomb.
Of course, plans can always change, but Grubb said this is accurate as of now. Another person, Zuby Tech, said on Twitter, said the event should happen on May 25 or June 1. Officially, Sony has not made any announcements. GameSpot has contacted the company in an attempt to get more details.
This has been rumor for months. Grubb reported in February that a big PlayStation event would happen before June. At the time, the report said this event would happen in the lead-up to E3 2023. That show is now canceled, but summertime gaming events are going ahead regardless. 
Jeff Grubb's Summer Game Mess has an update. That timing on PlayStation Showcase is right as of now. pic.twitter.com/90EmeI2xY5
If the PlayStation Showcase is real, it would take place before a bunch of big events in June like Summer Game Fest, the Xbox Games Showcase and Starfield Direct from Microsoft, Ubisoft Forward, and Gamescom Opening Night Live, among other events. Check out GameSpot's Not-E3 Schedule to learn more.
PlayStation's next big game is Marvel's Spider-Man 2, which is rumored to release in September.
The PlayStation brand is soaring at the moment. PS5 sales have climbed to more than 38 million through March 31. The 6.3 million units sold during the January-March period represents the most consoles than any company has ever shipped in a January-March quarter, beating all figures from past PlayStation consoles, as well as Xbox and Nintendo.

333,Philips Merged an LCD Monitor With an E-Ink Tablet for Chill Browsing,https://gizmodo.com/philips-e-ink-computer-monitor-price-china-buy-lcd-1850414756,"We’ve heard about the benefits of reflective electronic paper displays time and again, so why aren’t there E Ink monitors for those who spend all their time on a computer reading, writing, or crunching numbers? The answer is that there are E Ink computer displays, but they come with a lot of trade-offs. Philips’ new solution is a split screen monitor that puts both a black-and-white E Ink panel and a full-color LCD on your desk.
Electronic paper displays are so easy on the eyes because they both essentially work the same way as the printed page. Instead of light being directly beamed into a user’s eyes from a glowing panel, the technology relies on reflected light from another source. When an e-paper screen has a matte finish on the surface, light is further softened before it hits the eye.
The screens used for e-readers have other benefits too, including no flickering, but with limited refresh rates, ghosting artifacts, lower resolutions, and color with a very limited palette, electronic paper still can’t compete against LCD or OLED screens when it comes to the countless other tasks we use computers for—everything from watching movies to surfing the web.
Instead of trying to push the performance of electronic paper displays to compete with an LCD panel, Philips is just acknowledging the pros and cons of each technology with its 24B1D5600 monitor, which pairs a 23.8-inch LCD alongside a 13.3-inch E Ink screen right next to it.
A perfect treeThis magical little tree is a lot of fun to build, has a few customizable parts, and never needs watering to keep it alive. You can water it if you want, but it’s not necessary. 
Most of your day-to-day computing tasks will be handled by the LCD, which boasts a resolution of 2,560 × 1,440 pixels, a 75 Hz refresh rate, and the ability to reproduce 16.7 million colors. But if you find yourself having to read a long document or a text-heavy website, the 150 PPI, 1,200 x 1,600 E Ink panel right next to it can step in when your eyes need a break. It’s like having an e-paper tablet connected to the side of the screen. It can be angled inwards up to 45-degrees to find the perfect viewing angle, and has its own screen illumination including color temperature adjustments for those trying to minimize their blue light exposure at night.
Both the LCD and E Ink panels will need their own separate connection to your computer and a power source, but they’re plug-and-play compatible with both Windows and macOS computers, so you can spread your desktop across the two. For Windows-based machines, Philips also offers a SmartRemote app that purportedly makes it easier to display text-based document files on the E Ink panel in higher quality, including on-screen buttons for zooming and panning when a document doesn’t fit on the screen. However, when using that app, documents can only be displayed, and not actively edited.
Although available in markets like China for around $850, the Philips 24B1D5600 doesn’t look like it’s arrived in North America just yet, so those interested in importing one will have to do so through stores like Good e-Reader, which is currently asking a steep $1,600 for the setup, plus an extra $100 in shipping.

Perhaps woken by news of its next premier first-party title already looking really impressive on emulators, Nintendo has moved to take down key tools for emulating and unlocking Switch consoles, including one that lets Switch owners grab keys from their own device.
Simon Aarons maintained a forked repository of Lockpick, a tool (along with Lockpick_RCM) that grabbed the encryption keys from a Nintendo Switch and allowed it to run officially licensed games. Aarons tweeted on Thursday night that Nintendo had issued DMCA takedown requests to GitHub, asking Lockpick, Lockpick_RCM, and nearly 80 forks and derivations to be taken down under section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which largely makes illegal the circumvention of technological protection measures that safeguard copyrighted material.
Nintendo's takedown request (RTF file) notes that the Switch contains ""multiple technological protection measures"" that allow the Switch to play only ""legitimate Nintendo video game files."" Lockpick tools, combined with a modified Switch, let users grab the cryptographic keys from their own Switch and use them on ""systems without Nintendo's Console TPMs"" to play ""pirated versions of Nintendo's copyright-protected game software."" GitHub typically allows repositories with DMCA strikes filed against them to remain open while their maintainers argue their case.
Still, it was an effective move. Seeing Nintendo's move on Lockpick, a popular Switch emulator on Android, Skyline, called it quits over the weekend, at least as a public-facing tool you can easily download to your phone. In a Discord post [Edit, 5pm Eastern: Previously described as removed, but now linked], developer ""Mark"" wrote that ""the risks associated with a potential legal case are too high for us to ignore, and we cannot continue knowing that we may be in violation of copyright law.""
Prior to Nintendo's DMCA request, Skyline's team had believed that using keys from your own Switch console, to emulate games you legally purchased, was legal. Skyline remains as an open source project, though the core team will not update or otherwise work on it as of Sunday. Other popular Switch emulators for PC, Yuzu, and Ryujinx, remain online, with the Ryujinx team issuing a statement on their Discord that they would not be shutting down, according to news reports.
Lockpick, which remains up as of this writing, has been in development since early 2019. Nintendo's sudden interest in ensuring that people can't rip keys from their Switch or emulate Switch games regardless of provenance likely stems from this week's May 12 launch of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Physical copies of Tears began circulating shortly before May 1, leading to the game being dumped, pirated, played, and streamed, although usually for only moments before Nintendo moved to shut down Discord servers and Twitch streams.
Nintendo has been fighting uses of its hardware beyond anything it intended for nearly its entire life, at least as a video game company. The DS, 3DS, Wii, and even the Game & Watch novelty release have all seen hacking and homebrew scenes. The Switch, in particular, has seen Nintendo work hard to avoid widespread piracy, setting up online blockers for pirates, releasing new hack-resistant hardware, targeting online mod retailers, issuing ISP-level blocks, and, most recently, following through on criminal prosecution that will leave one hack-team member likely paying the company for the rest of his life.
Every time Nintendo clamps down on the tools used to enable piracy, it also disrupts the ecosystems that produce Linux installations, homebrew games and tools, and emulators for legally purchased games. That said, Tears of the Kingdom is rather easy to find online at the moment, as are exhaustive guides to getting the game running in PC emulation tools. The cat seems entirely out of the bag, but this cat also requires hours of effort to get running smoothly on even the most upgraded PC and requires lots of downloads from sites that push ad blockers to their limits.
Most people who want to really play and enjoy Tears will do so with a Switch and a purchase. Nintendo will mostly succeed at making any other approaches harder to pull off.

AppleT+V's gripping new sci-fi show Silo tells of a dystopian world deep underground where thousands of residents are told that the toxic world above is uninhabitable.
And it appears one family from Georgia are ahead of the game should that plotline ever unfold. 
Internet consultant Ruben Romero moved with his wife Joan and their four children Eden, Enoch, Zion and Celestial into a 6,000-square-foot nuclear-resistant former communications bunker in June 2020.
The unusual abode - built in the 1960s by telecommunications company AT&T out of reinforced concrete - cost the the family around $300,000 with a 13-acre plot of land included and despite years of toil, the renovation process is still underway. 
Ruben Romero from Georgia spent seven years looking for a bunker He finally found one priced at $300,000 with a 13-acre plot of land
The internet consultant moved into the bunker with his family in June 2020
Moving outside, the bunker is barely visible with unkempt grass covering it
Some of the biggest home improvements to date include installing internet, a contraption to filter the air, repairing the sewage system and putting in a water filtration unit
While the Romeros have almost three years of DIY under their belts Ruben, aged 46, told DailyMail.com that there is still lots of work to do
Some of the biggest home improvements to date include installing internet, a contraption to filter the air, repairing the sewage system and putting in a water filtration unit.
As the industrial-style bunker has no windows, another essential element to sort from the get-go was lighting. 
The sprawling subterranean pad now features full spectrum lights in the main living spaces to give the effect of daylight.
While the Romeros have almost three years of DIY under their belts Ruben, aged 46, told DailyMail.com that there is still lots of work to do, with a 'proper' kitchen on the top of their to-do list. 
So far the Romeros have been using a makeshift kitchen with the basic pieces of equipment including an induction hotplate, a microwave and an air fryer.
One post shared to their Instagram account @undergroundliving shows the Romeros enjoying their first meal in their new home. 
Ruben explains in the caption that they feasted on a 'dinner of pita and hummus, on a cardboard box dinning room table we threw together for the occasion.' 
Other posts on YouTube show more behind-the-scenes snapshots from the Romeros' bunker. 
In one clip Ruben touches on the plumbing system and explains that the toilets in the bunker were on springs when they first moved in, as this would prevent the plumbing from breaking if there was a blast.
The family's living situation is an eerie real-life echo of AppleTV+'s new post-apocalyptic series Silo, a novel adaptation which tells the story of Earth's last inhabitants living underground
Ruben and his wife have transformed the mezzanine level into their bedroom
The Romero's son sleeps in a room to himself and their daughters are split between a bunk bed and a tent in another room
On opening a 'front door', their is a stairwell leading down to the bunker
Another unusual feature of the unconventional home are its nuclear blast-proof doors 'so that if a nuclear bomb hit five, ten miles away - which is pretty close - we'd be ok.' 
In terms of the spaces, there are four large rooms in the bunker, all with 16.5ft ceilings. 
There is also a mezzanine space, a pump room and a small fan room. Ruben and his wife have transformed the mezzanine level into their bedroom, while their son sleeps in a room to himself and their daughters are split between a bunk bed and a tent in another room. 
Moving outside, the bunker is barely visible bar from a cell phone antenna and a  small building which serves as the access point. 
On opening a 'front door', their is a stairwell leading down to the bunker and there is also a pulley lift which can be used to transport heavy goods such as furniture and groceries.
While the underground home is located on a patch of farmland, Ruben says luckily there are plenty of amenities nearby to make 'bunker life' easier. 
He muses in one video: '[We are] 15 to 20 minutes away from a town with a Home Depot and a Walmart so that's kind of cool.'
Looking ahead, the Romeros' dream is to be completely self sufficient. 
Above ground they have started growing their own produce and a water butt allows them to collect rain water. 
Ruben has also investigated growing mushrooms in the bunker as 'they don't need a ton of water.'
The father-of-four says one of the most common questions he gets asked is how the children have adapted.
He explains that luckily 'they are pretty easy going so they have adapted well. However, 'they certainly know it's a little strange.'

So far the Romeros have been using a makeshift kitchen with the basic pieces of equipment including an induction hotplate, a microwave and an air fryer 
Ruben highlights that you also can't get a loan or mortgage for a bunker from a bank
Currently his three daughters and son are being home schooled, with a heavy emphasis on DIY. 
As he can work remotely and has a strong WiFi connectivity in the bunker, Ruben has been able to keep his business running. 
Asked for his advice to others considering bunker life, Ruben says 'just do it.'
After getting the idea to live underground, it took him seven years to find the perfect place as the bunker market is 'pretty niche.'
The handyman explains: 'You have to understand the market of bunkers. Like you can go and find one... like there's two on eBay right now that are for sale but the ones asking $600,000 and the other person's asking $1.2 million. 
'It's such an eclectic kind of thing. They're hard to resell... you'll see people who have owned them for like ten years and haven't done anything with them... and there's a reason for that.
'They don't just sit on the market because the demand's high, they sit on the market because the demand's not high.
'I would not recommend buying one as an investment property - I will never see the amount of money I put into this back.'
Ruben highlights that you also can't get a loan or mortgage for a bunker from a bank. He was only able to make the purchase when he 'found a seller who was willing to sell at a reasonable price and was willing to carry the note.'
Looking ahead, Ruben says of his vision for the bunker: 'My dream is to make this into a place where I could have my family come back as my kids get older... get married... I wanna have enough space so they could come here and we could have a family reunion.
Silo is a ten-part series that stars actress Rebecca Ferguson and rapper Common (seen)
'We plan to renovate this into our forever home so we plan on living here to the end.'
While many people have him down as a 'doomsday prepper', Ruben says his motivation for buying the bunker wasn't being fearful of the future and looking ahead to a Silo-esque world. 
However, he concludes: 'It is hard to have a bunker and not have a little bit of prepper come out in you.'
Ruben's underground living situation is an eerie echo of the story being told in AppleTV+'s new post-apocalyptic show Silo, in which Earth's last remaining inhabitants are forced to live in an enormous bunker-style structure far below its surface. 
Something terrible has happened to make the environment toxic so 10,000 people are hiding out in a massive, mile-deep underground silo until it's safe to come out. They grow food, maintain a huge generator for power and recycle everything.
'Life in the silo in many ways is pretty good. They´re part of this cause, which is basically just to stay alive until the day that it is safe to go outside. So they feel that they´ve got this common mission,' creator Graham Yost explained. 
'But you just get a sense that there´s been a slight eugenic program to try and breed out curiosity, independence, obstreperousness - all those nasty human things. And you also get the sense that that´s not going to succeed.'

What makes the segment so interesting is that appraiser Travis Landry takes it very seriously, and enthusiastically walks his audience through a ton of cool facts about just how rare some of these cards are. I was unsure how a video game-related item would be treated on the storied PBS program, but Landry was surprisingly attuned to the nuances of selling these cards.
Antiques Roadshow is a show where antiques appraisers travel to different places and evaluate locals’ possessions for cultural significance and monetary value. It’s a neat show that helps you understand how an object’s history is evaluated in monetary terms. Normally, people bring on things like oil paintings, sports memorabilia, and fine jewelry. While the show does appraise baseball cards from time to time, Pokémon cards feel like they belong in a different category altogether. Nevertheless, pop culture appraiser Travis Landry showed off his Pokémon knowledge to PBS viewers.
The owner’s mother purchased the full base set of cards, which also includes some duplicates, for her child in 1999. Back then, the entire binder cost her mom $35. “Like most 90s babies, I fell into the craze. We were playing with them on the school bus, trading them, and my mom bought this set online,” the owner says. “My mom thought I was being taken advantage of in trades, so she bought me this complete set to save until I got older.”
Landry then gives a basic rundown of the Pokémon card game’s 1990s origins before getting to the good stuff. These cards came from the original base set, and were printed in two variations. Some cards were printed with a “shadow border” framing the card art, while others were more rare “shadowless” cards. The shadowless copies are also distinguished by having their print dates printed twice on the bottom of the card—once in the middle of the card, and then again at the end. The difference in rarity meant that the borderless Mewtwo would fetch approximately $800 more than its common counterpart. 
The appraiser acknowledged that potential buyers wouldn’t care about some TV appraiser saying what these cards are worth—real collectors want the cards graded by a third party company. But he estimated that the cards were in near-mint condition.
Amazon has dropped the price of this kid-friendly 10-inch WiFi/Bluetooth tablet by a whopping 82%.
He told the guest that the Pokémon card market was extremely “volatile.” While her holographic Charizard would fetch $2,000 to $3,000 now, it would have been worth $5,000 to $8,000 last year, and, he said, could have sold for as much as $15,000 at the height of Poké-mania during the pandemic years. Still, the binder was an impressive collection that could fetch $5,000 to 10,000 by Landry’s conservative estimates. The owner was surprised, as her friends thought that the collection was only worth $50. 
Landry sounded aghast. “Oh man, you need some new friends!”",1

Last call! Today presents the final moments in which PlayStation 5 owners can claim the PlayStation Plus Collection of last-gen hit games. And you can do so for cheaper by getting a one-year PlayStation Plus Essential membership for $48.43 (about $12 off) at Eneba with offer code USPlus. This deal from Eneba was initially set to expire today, but it’s been extended through May 9th at 7AM ET — just enough time to allow more gamers to claim games like Ratchet & Clank (2016), God of War (2018), Bloodborne, The Last Of Us Remastered (the PS4 version, not the PS5 remake), and Persona 5 (which, confusingly, went away and returned) from Sony.
And yes, you can just claim all 20 games being offered by adding them to your account (you don’t even have to download them), and they’ll remain yours as long as you subscribe to an Essential plan — even if you lapse and later resubscribe.
While lots of these titles are now offered on PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium tiers, you might as well make them your own before Sony takes this little perk of PS5 ownership away tomorrow.
A membership to PlayStation Plus Essential allows PlayStation 4 and PS5 owners to play games online, download free monthly titles, use cloud save backups, and take advantage of discounts on the PS Store. Eneba is offering a year of membership for $48.43 with offer code USPlus until May 9th at 7AM ET.
Last week brought lots of Lego Star Wars deals for May the 4th, and now, there are some nice discounts for a more general swath of Lego fans — including ones that may make a nice Mother’s Day gift if you’re still shopping and want to save.
First off, there are a few great botanical Lego sets on sale that are each selling for $39.99 (a discount of $10). These deals include the Lego Orchid set (Best Buy / Amazon), the Lego Succulents (Amazon / Best Buy), and the Lego Bonsai Tree (Amazon / Best Buy). Each of these is a fun build that makes excellent home decor, especially since you never have to worry about watering or caring for it. The sale prices on the orchid and succulents are the lowest to date, with the bonsai being a second-best price. It sure beats buying a pricey plant that is likely to die.
A 608-piece orchid Lego kit, complete with pot.
Lego’s 771-piece succulents can be displayed together as a mini garden or separated as small individual plants.
A bonsai tree you never have to trim after you build it from its 878 pieces. It can be decorated with green leaves or pink cherry blossoms.
If you prefer your building kits to be a little more “classico,” the Lego Vespa set is on sale for $79.99 ($20 off) at Best Buy. That’s the lowest price for this adorable set, which includes a working kickstand and a removable side panel to see the modeled engine inside. It even has real steering so you can imagine yourself winding through some busy Italian piazzas. Now, if only it came in yellow.
The Lego Vespa consists of 1,106 pieces and includes a cute helmet, basket, and flower bouquet.

341,Questionable Rumor Claims iOS 17 Features Redesigned Maps Lock Screen - MacRumors,https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/ios-17-maps-lock-screen-interface/,"iOS 17 will introduce a new iPhone experience for Apple Maps that integrates detailed turn-by-turn directions to the Lock Screen without taking over the display, claims a leaker with alleged insider information.
Concept render shared by Analyst941Currently in iOS 16, when real-time Maps directions are active and the iPhone is locked, the Maps app takes over the screen and all other Lock Screen elements are hidden. According to Twitter account Analyst941, this will change in iOS 17, with Maps directions including live visual map data taking over a portion of the Lock Screen, but with app notifications and the Camera and Flashlight buttons remaining at the base of the display.
The leaker claims that app notifications will still be accessible by swiping up on the screen, while the physical act of unlocking the iPhone will remain a seamless transition. According to Analyst941, the new Maps Lock Screen interface will be coming to ""all iPhones."" 
This is the first time we have heard about specific changes to Maps for iOS 17, and the leaker has made several other claims about iOS 17 that have yet to be corroborated. This rumor, and others like it, should therefore be taken with a grain of salt. 
Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has expressed doubt about Analyst941's claims and believes that some of the information is inaccurate. We'll know more about their accuracy in just under a month when Apple unveils ‌iOS 17‌, watchOS 10, and other updates at the June 5 WWDC keynote.

342,MSI Data Breach: Private Code Signing Keys Leaked on the Dark Web,https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/msi-data-breach-private-code-signing.html,"The threat actors behind the ransomware attack on Taiwanese PC maker MSI last month have leaked the company's private code signing keys on their dark website.
""Confirmed, Intel OEM private key leaked, causing an impact on the entire ecosystem,"" Alex Matrosov, founder and CEO of firmware security firm Binarly, said in a tweet over the weekend.
""It appears that Intel Boot Guard may not be effective on certain devices based on the 11th Tiger Lake, 12th Adler Lake, and 13th Raptor Lake.""
Present in the leaked data are firmware image signing keys associated with 57 PCs and private signing keys for Intel Boot Guard used on 116 MSI products. The Boot Guard keys from MSI are believed to impact several device vendors, including Intel, Lenovo and Supermicro.
Intel Boot Guard is a hardware-based security technology that's designed to protect computers against executing tampered UEFI firmware.
The development comes a month after MSI fell victim to a double extortion ransomware attack perpetrated by a new ransomware gang known as Money Message.
MSI, in a regulatory filing at the time, said, ""the affected systems have gradually resumed normal operations, with no significant impact on financial business."" It, however, urged users to obtain firmware/BIOS updates only from its official website and refrain from downloading files from other sources.
The leak of the Intel Boot Guard keys poses significant risks as it undermines a vital firmware integrity check and could allow threat actors to sign malicious updates and other payloads and deploy them on targeted systems without raising any red flags.
Join our webinar and learn how to stop ransomware attacks in their tracks with real-time MFA and service account protection.
It also follows another advisory from MSI recommending users to be on the lookout for fraudulent emails targeting the online gaming community that claim to be from the company under the pretext of a potential collaboration.
This is not the first time UEFI firmware code has entered the public domain. In October 2022, Intel acknowledged the leak of Alder Lake BIOS source code by a third party, which also included the private signing key used for Boot Guard.
Following the publication of the story, Supermicro told The Hacker News that it investigated the risks stemming the leak of Intel Boot Guard keys and that its products are not affected.
""Based on our current review and investigation, Supermicro products are not affected,"" a spokesperson for the San Jose-based company said.

Geoffrey Hinton, perhaps the most important person in the recent history of artificial intelligence, recently sent me a video of Snoop Dogg. 
In the clip of a discussion panel, the rapper expresses profane amazement at how artificial intelligence software, such as ChatGPT, can now hold a coherent and meaningful conversation. 
“Then I heard the old dude that created AI saying, ‘This is not safe ’cause the AIs got their own mind and these motherfuckers gonna start doing their own shit,’” Snoop says. “And I’m like, ‘Is we in a fucking movie right now or what?’” 
The “old dude” is, of course, Hinton. He didn’t create AI exactly, but has played a major role in developing the artificial neural network foundations of today’s most powerful AI programs, including ChatGPT, the chatbot that has sparked widespread debate about how rapidly machine intelligence is progressing.
“Snoop gets it,” Hinton tells me over Zoom from his home in London. The researcher recently left Google so that he could more freely call attention to the risks posed by intelligent machines. Hinton says AI is advancing more quickly than he and other experts expected, meaning there is an urgent need to ensure that humanity can contain and manage it. He is most concerned about near-term risks such as more sophisticated, AI-generated disinformation campaigns, but he also believes the long-term problems could be so serious that we need to start worrying about them now.
When asked what triggered his newfound alarm about the technology he has spent his life working on, Hinton points to two recent flashes of insight. 
One was a revelatory interaction with a powerful new AI system—in his case, Google’s AI language model PaLM, which is similar to the model behind ChatGPT, and which the company made accessible via an API in March. A few months ago, Hinton says he asked the model to explain a joke that he had just made up—he doesn’t recall the specific quip—and was astonished to get a response that clearly explained what made it funny. “I’d been telling people for years that it's gonna be a long time before AI can tell you why jokes are funny,” he says. “It was a kind of litmus test.”
Hinton’s second sobering realization was that his previous belief that software needed to become much more complex—akin to the human brain—to become significantly more capable was probably wrong. PaLM is a large program, but its complexity pales in comparison to the brain’s, and yet it could perform the kind of reasoning that humans take a lifetime to attain. 
Hinton concluded that as AI algorithms become larger, they might outstrip their human creators within a few years. “I used to think it would be 30 to 50 years from now,” he says. “Now I think it's more likely to be five to 20.”
Hinton isn’t the only person to have been shaken by the new capabilities that large language models such as PaLM or GPT-4 have begun demonstrating. Last month, a number of prominent AI researchers and others signed an open letter calling for a pause on the development of anything more powerful than currently exists. But since leaving Google, Hinton feels his views on whether the development of AI should continue have been misconstrued.

“A lot of the headlines have been saying that I think it should be stopped now—and I've never said that,” he says. “First of all, I don't think that's possible, and I think we should continue to develop it because it could do wonderful things. But we should put equal effort into mitigating or preventing the possible bad consequences.”
Hinton says he didn’t leave Google to protest its handling of this new form of AI. In fact, he says, the company moved relatively cautiously despite having a lead in the area. Researchers at Google invented a type of neural network known as a transformer, which has been crucial to the development of models like PaLM and GPT-4.
In the 1980s, Hinton, a professor at the University of Toronto, along with a handful of other researchers, sought to give computers greater intelligence by training artificial neural networks with data instead of programming them in the conventional way. The networks could digest pixels as input, and, as they saw more examples, adjust the values connecting their crudely simulated neurons until the system could recognize the contents of an image. The approach showed fits of promise over the years, but it wasn’t until a decade ago that its real power and potential became apparent. 
In 2018, Hinton was given the Turing Award, the most prestigious prize in computer science, for his work on neural networks. He received the prize together with two other pioneering figures, Yann LeCun, Meta’s chief AI scientist, and Yoshua Bengio, a professor at the University of Montreal. 
That’s when a new generation of many-layered artificial neural networks—fed copious amounts of training data and run on powerful computer chips—were suddenly far better than any existing program at labeling the contents of photographs. 
The technique, known as deep learning, kicked off a renaissance in artificial intelligence, with Big Tech companies rushing to recruit AI experts, build increasingly powerful deep learning algorithms, and apply them to products such as face recognition, translation, and speech recognition.
Google hired Hinton in 2013 after acquiring his company, DNNResearch, founded to commercialize his university lab’s deep learning ideas. Two years later, one of Hinton’s grad students who had also joined Google, Ilya Sutskever, left the search company to cofound OpenAI as a nonprofit counterweight to the power being amassed by Big Tech companies in AI.
Since its inception, OpenAI has focused on scaling up the size of neural networks, the volume of data they guzzle, and the computer power they consume. In 2019, the company reorganized as a for-profit corporation with outside investors, and later took $10 billion from Microsoft. It has developed a series of strikingly fluent text-generation systems, most recently GPT-4, which powers the premium version of ChatGPT and has stunned researchers with its ability to perform tasks that seem to require reasoning and common sense.
Hinton believes we already have a technology that will be disruptive and destabilizing. He points to the risk, as others have done, that more advanced language algorithms will be able to wage more sophisticated misinformation campaigns and interfere in elections.

The most impressive new capabilities of GPT-4 and models like PaLM are what he finds most unsettling. The fact that AI models can perform complex logical reasoning and interact with humans, and are progressing more quickly than expected, leads some to worry that we are getting closer to seeing algorithms capable of outsmarting humans seeking more control. “What really worries me is that you have to create subgoals in order to be efficient, and a very sensible subgoal for more or less anything you want to do is to get more power—get more control,” Hinton says.
Some of those raising the alarm about AI have been extreme in their claims. Eliezer Yudkowsky, a researcher at the nonprofit Machine Intelligence Research Institute, has claimed in a recent TED talk, as well as in an article for Time, that AI is on course to kill everyone on earth and that nations should be willing to use deadly force to ensure the development of AI comes to a stop. “I listened to him thinking he was going to be crazy. I don't think he's crazy at all,” Hinton says. “But, okay, it’s not helpful to talk about bombing data centers.”
Recent leaps in AI also conjure up utopian ideas. Hinton points to Ray Kurzweil, another AI pioneer now at Google. “Ray wants to be immortal,” he says. “Well, the good news is we’ve figured out how to make immortal beings, the bad news is it’s not for us. But can you imagine if all old white men hung around forever?”
But Hinton also confesses that he doesn’t know how to control the AI that OpenAI, Google, and others are building. “I really don't know,” he says. “All I'm saying is a lot of smart people should be putting a lot of effort into figuring out how we deal with the possibility of AI taking over as one of all the other possibilities.”
Hinton certainly believes that AI scientists now have a vital role in drawing attention to the risks that may lie ahead, devising new safeguards, and working across international lines. “Maybe I should actually be talking to Chinese scientists,” he says, and suggests he might send an email to Andrew Yao, a professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing who, like him, won the Turing Award and is famous for his research in AI.
I ask Hinton whether he sees the effort to mitigate the emerging risks posed by AI as a kind of Manhattan Project, which would perhaps make him a modern J. Robert Oppenheimer. “They just had to make something go bang, but it is a lot harder to make sure something doesn’t,” he says. 
Despite the importance of his warning, Hinton has not lost his acerbic sense of humor, as is clear when he explains why a more advanced form of AI would inevitably become unruly, even dangerous.
“How many examples do you know of a more intelligent thing being controlled by a less intelligent thing—well, since Biden got elected of course,” he says. “Oh, and you can quote me on that last bit.”

345,Something Awful is racing to save the best and worst of web history - The Verge,https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/8/23713128/something-awful-imgur-download-caper-digital-preservation-photo-hosting,"By  Adi Robertson
It’s easy to forget how fragile the internet’s memory is, but last month, members of the Something Awful forums got a rude reminder. Ubiquitous image host Imgur announced it would be deleting nudity and pornography starting in mid-May and, along with it, “old, unused, and inactive content” not linked to an account. The wording was so vague nobody knew exactly what that meant. But the worst-case scenario was obvious: an unceremonious purge of images from one of the longest-running communities on the web. A frantic discussion thread commenced, and soon, the solution seemed obvious, too. Using a spreadsheet as a home base, with a tight deadline of May 15th, Something Awful’s members had to help download the source images of as many Imgur links as possible — ideally, anything ever posted to the site.
A few weeks later, Something Awful’s owner — who goes by Jeffrey of YOSPOS — is feeling confident. “We’re rock-solid,” Jeffrey told The Verge via forum direct message. Though there’s still plenty of work to do, he says site members have secured multiple copies of a roughly three-terabyte collection of pictures and short videos, now held on both users’ hard drives and Something Awful’s own. He plans to have them hosted by the end of May, leaving a minimal gap if anything’s deleted. But what’s been internally dubbed the Great Imgur Download Caper isn’t a one-time averted crisis. It’s part of a constant struggle to shore up digital culture and to convince people that it matters.
“There are many people who started posting on this site as children who are now raising children of their own.”
Something Awful has a long and notorious past, and much of its nearly 25-year history is told through pictures. The site is one of the fountainheads of our modern visual internet, responsible, among other things, for latter-day cryptid Slender Man and the rise of cheezburger-loving Happy Cat. It’s a place defined by the constant remixing of strange and funny images, encouraged by traditions like Photoshop Phriday, a recurring showcase for creative digital manipulation. “There are many people who started posting on this site as children who are now raising children of their own,” says Jeffrey. (Jeffrey is not the site’s first owner; he purchased it in 2020 from founder Richard “Lowtax” Kyanka, who died in 2021.) Sharing their visual creations is what’s kept many of them coming back.
But the existence of these images has never been exactly stable. As with many forums, Something Awful has historically relied on external hosts like Imgur, which promise free uploads with just a few clicks. It’s a great deal until, almost invariably, the services start culling old photos and leaving behind thumbnail remnants: a broken Flickr link, ImageShack’s lonely yellow frog. Imgur isn’t the first time the site’s members have scrambled to back up a service. An earlier project saw them downloading and rehosting a smaller trove of files from wafflephotos — some holding onto images for a full decade, Jeffrey says, before the site could officially restore them.
The Imgur Download Caper was organized by Jeffrey and a pair of Something Awful administrators, and it involves, basically, three steps. The first step was to scrape Something Awful itself, parsing its decades’ worth of threads to identify and extract links to Imgur. Those targets were identified and compiled into gigantic text files, each one holding 100,000 Imgur link addresses. From there, the site’s members (known as goons) jumped into action on the second step: divvying up the chunks and mass downloading them, using scripts shared and tweaked by other posters.
These first two steps were time-sensitive. Not only did goons need to beat Imgur’s mid-May deadline but they also needed to account for the possibility that Imgur would treat the download as some kind of attack and throttle it — a possibility that, it turns out, never came to pass. They’ll have more leeway for the third and final step: hosting the images from servers paid for by Something Awful itself, then overwriting the original posts’ hotlinks to point toward them. “We have to coordinate to get everything in one place and validated, but we can take our time and get it right,” Jeffrey says.
Jeffrey says he’s also been in touch with Archive Team, the self-described “rogue archivist” community that’s stepped in to preserve cultural artifacts like SoundCloud music and Google Plus posts. Archive Team is working on its own full-scale Imgur project — team member Arkiver tells The Verge that it’s backing up links at a rate of about 600 submissions a second, adding up to hundreds of millions of downloads. That offers a fallback of last resort for Something Awful. No matter who’s backing up the pictures, however, the forum’s managers will have to do the work of updating posts to make sure they link to archived images, keeping their original context preserved.
“Websites promising that they’ll ‘host your images for free’ are never gonna stop running out of money”
It’s possible that, even without either of these preservation efforts, many of the Imgur links would remain sound given how little detail Imgur has offered on what it’s deleting. (The company, acquired by MediaLab in 2021, didn’t respond to a request for more details from The Verge in April.) But Jeffrey says hunting for an answer is a “losing proposition” for the site. “It’s clear we need to host our own images. Websites promising that they’ll ‘host your images for free’ are never gonna stop running out of money — it’s nearly impossible to monetize a site like that,” he says. “We have an opportunity here to get out of that cycle for good.” Expanding hosting is a project that was on the site’s radar already, he says, but one that Imgur’s impending changes have made more pressing.
Something Awful has the benefit of being a paid forum — there’s a $10 fee to sign up, plus more for perks like private messages or an ad-free site. Jeffrey estimates that the Imgur files will cost between $80 and $100 per month to host on top of an unknown cost for the initial archival, a price he says the registration fees will help defray. On other sites, administrators may face the same challenges without the same support. “A good deal of the modern internet is treated as transient and ‘okay to delete whenever,’ and that is a real shame,” says Jeffrey. “Does no one at Reddit care that fifteen years worth of Reddit posts are going to suddenly be full of broken links?”
In fact, parts of the internet have moved toward deliberate ephemerality and obscurity. People have flocked to disappearing message platforms and closed forums like Discord, which have few meaningful archival options. European privacy laws have enshrined a “right to be forgotten” that lets people remove potentially embarrassing information from the web. And a lot of Something Awful’s images are silly, obscene, offensive, or all of the above. As one Twitter voyeur highlighted, opening any of those downloaded files means risking an eyeful of the internet’s most infamous shock images. When the Imgur news first broke, at least a few members thought the purge might not be a bad thing. Some cracked jokes about getting to finally bid their younger selves’ cringeworthy uploads farewell.
But history is made of silly, embarrassing ephemera. “If anyone is to ever look back on our society, they won’t be able to understand it without understanding the internet. Anyone who spends any appreciable amount of time online will experience both the best and worst that humanity has to offer,” Jeffrey says. “People put a lot of themselves into their internet presence and that is reason enough that it should be recorded, warts and all.”

Nintendo’s next big live event will take place in Seattle this September, and today, the company revealed dates and more details about Nintendo Live 2023. The event will run from September 1st through September 4th at the Seattle Convention Center and is intended to be an all-ages celebration of Nintendo’s games, as just one of many gaming companies planning events this summer in the shadow of E3 2023’s cancellation.
Nintendo Live 2023 is going to be a free event, and there are two ways to get tickets. You can register in a randomly selected drawing on Nintendo’s website at some point between May 31st and June 22nd, where you could get a one-day pass for a group of up to six people. 
Kids under the age of six don’t need their own ticket, but the person registering must be a US resident who is over 18 and has a Nintendo account. It’s taking place alongside the PAX West event but will require separate tickets.
However, if you’re attending PAX West, there’s a separate drawing you can enter to receive a free ticket, which will allow one person access to the Nintendo event. According to Nintendo’s FAQ, there’s no waitlist for tickets and walk-up tickets will not be available, so anyone hoping to attend will need to register via one of these drawings or maybe earn their way in via competitive tournaments playing Mario Kart 8 or Splatoon 3.
The site isn’t specific about what kind of spectacles attendees should expect or how it’ll top last year’s Animal Crossing + Splatoon live concert. Nintendo says it isn’t announcing any new products at the event but confirmed a live stage, photo ops with iconic characters, opportunities to play Switch games, and an on-site store with exclusive merchandise.

By now, you’ve likely heard that passwordless Google accounts have finally arrived. This alternative for passwords is known as ""passkeys.""
There are many misconceptions about passkeys, both in terms of their usability and the security and privacy benefits they offer compared with current authentication methods. That’s not surprising, given that passwords have been in use for the past 60 years, and passkeys are so new. The long and short of it is that with a few minutes of training, passkeys are easier to use than passwords, and in a matter of months—once a dozen or so industry partners finish rolling out the remaining pieces—using passkeys will be easier still. Passkeys are also vastly more secure and privacy-preserving than passwords, for reasons I'll explain later.
This article provides a primer to get people started with Google's implementation of passkeys and explains the technical underpinnings that make them a much easier and more effective way to protect against account takeovers. A handful of smaller sites—specifically, PayPal, Instacart, Best Buy, Kayak, Robinhood, Shop Pay, and Cardpointers—have rolled out various options for logging in with passkeys, but those choices are more proofs of concept than working solutions. Google is the first major online service to make passkeys available, and its offering is refined and comprehensive enough that I’m recommending people turn them on today.
First, it helps to know exactly what a passkey is and how it works. Apple provides a helpful description here of the technical underpinnings of passkeys:
Passkeys are built on the WebAuthentication (or ""WebAuthn"") standard, which uses public key cryptography. During account registration, the operating system creates a unique cryptographic key pair to associate with an account for the app or website. These keys are generated by the device, securely and uniquely, for every account.
One of these keys is public, and is stored on the server. This public key is not a secret. The other key is private, and is what is needed to actually sign in. The server never learns what the private key is. On Apple devices with Touch ID or Face ID available, they can be used to authorize use of the passkey, which then authenticates the user to the app or website. No shared secret is transmitted, and the server does not need to protect the public key. This makes passkeys very strong, easy to use credentials that are highly phishing-resistant. And platform vendors have worked together within the FIDO Alliance to make sure that passkey implementations are compatible cross-platform and can work on as many devices as possible.
The FIDO specs require that whatever syncing mechanism a user elects (be it from Apple, Microsoft, Google, or a third party) it provide end-to-end encryption the way iCloud Keychain and password syncing with browsers currently do (on Chrome, this E2EE must be turned on). This means that the private key is unknown to the cloud provider. The private key resides on the device and can only be accessed by unlocking the device using either a unlock PIN, a fingerprint or face scan.

By the time I woke up on Wednesday—the day Google rolled out passwordless Google accounts—my Pixel 7 already had a passkey automatically created. I didn’t notice until I accessed g.co/passkeys, which is a shortcut to myaccount.google.com/signinoptions/passkeys, the page Google has installed for managing account passkeys. To my surprise, the key was already there. Since my account was enrolled in Google’s Advanced Protection Program (APP), this new key appeared immediately above two-factor authentication (2FA) keys that APP requires for bootstrapping new browsers that log in.
As the image indicates, I was using Chrome on the MacBook Air to access the page even though my preferred browser these days is Firefox. The reason: Firefox does not yet support passkeys on macOS, although that will change, likely sooner than later. I ultimately decided to continue using Safari for the rest of the process because passkeys created using that browser on macOS and iOS are automatically synced through the iCloud Keychain. For the time being, passkeys created with Chrome and Edge on Apple platforms are not.
Accessing the same g.co/passkeys page in Safari, I scrolled to the bottom and clicked ""Create a Passkey"" and received a dialog box providing a short explanation of passkeys. From there, I clicked the ""Continue"" button. The next screen that appeared explained I was saving a passkey that would be stored in iCloud. Once I clicked ""done,"" the passkey section of myaccounts.google.com updated to indicate that a new passkey had been created.

348,Google Pixel Tablet specs leak just days ahead of I/O - The Verge,https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/8/23715130/google-pixel-tablet-specs-leak-release-date-io,"By  Emma Roth
The expected launch of the Google Pixel Tablet is just days away, but its specs have already been leaked online, as spotted earlier by WinFuture. A now-removed listing from Amazon’s Japanese website reveals that the 11-inch tablet will feature Google’s Tensor G2 chip with 8GB of RAM and up to 256GB of storage.
The listing also indicates that the device will come with an LCD display with a 2560 x 1600 resolution, 500 nits of brightness, up to 12 hours of video streaming, and USI 2.0 stylus support. Other notable features include two eight-megapixel cameras on the front and back of the device, quad speakers, three microphones, a USB-C charging port, and support for Wi-Fi 6.
While the leaked listing has the tablet priced at ¥79,800 (around $591) for 128GB of storage, previous rumors suggest that the tablet could start at €600 (around $662) in Europe. Google hasn’t revealed a release date for the Pixel Tablet, either, but the listing notes a launch date of June 20th.
Google first took the wraps off of its Android-powered Pixel Tablet at its I/O event last year, which is set to come with a wireless dock that functions as both a charging station and speaker. This will allow you to use the device as a smart display, sort of like the Amazon Echo Show. The Pixel Tablet is expected to come in four colors in addition to the green / black and beige / white combos Google already revealed. That could include this light pink color option we saw in this video of the tablets captured in April.
We’ll likely see the Pixel Tablet revealed in full at Google’s I/O event on Wednesday, where the company is also expected to show off the newly announced Pixel Fold, the budget-friendly Pixel 7A, and maybe even a preview of the upcoming Pixel 8 and 8 Pro.

349,Samsung promises it won't kill your background apps in One UI 6.0,https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-google-background-app-promise-3321467/,"Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.

Android’s foundation is built on freedom and choice, manifesting itself in how OEMs can take open-source Android and customize it to their customer’s liking through Android UX skins. One side-effect of this approach has been the wildly inconsistent behavior for foreground and background apps and services. Google is now taking one step toward fixing this inconsistency, as it has announced a deeper partnership with Samsung for its upcoming Android 14-based One UI 6.0 update.
App developers and end users have long been unhappy with how some OEMs can be very aggressive in how they treat background services. Apps like instant messaging apps and others are frequently killed in the background, causing users to miss important messages and more. It’s a bad experience for everyone, further exacerbated by how different this behavior can be across the various UX skins that are present in the Android ecosystem.
Google wants to ensure that APIs dictating how apps work in the background function predictably and consistently across the ecosystem. To this end, the company has announced that it has partnered with Samsung to ensure that foreground services of apps will function in the same way on One UI 6.0 as they do on Android 14.
Samsung mentions the following in the announcement:
This is great news for app developers. As long as app developers build the app up to the correct spec and follow Google-recommended best practices, they can expect the apps (and their relevant background and foreground services) to work reliably on One UI 6.0.
Curiously, the announcement from Google mentions that Samsung is the “first partner.” If we’re allowed to read between the lines, this suggests more Android OEMs could come on board in the future.
Part of the reason iOS receives a lot of praise is the consistent software experience across the lineup. While the same wouldn’t be a fair comparison considering the sheer breadth of Android devices out there, any step in achieving a consistent and predictable experience would be appreciated by both app developers and end users.
Android 14 contains a slew of changes under the hood that work toward this future. We hope to learn more at Google I/O.",1

351,Will Google announce a Nest Hub update at I/O? - The Verge,https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/8/23688662/google-nest-hub-interface-io-2023,"By  Nathan Edwards
If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.
Google I/O is a couple of days away and, with it, the likely launch of the Pixel Tablet. By itself, the device is just another Android tablet, but when it’s connected to its charging dock, which has built-in speakers, it looks an awful lot like the Nest Hub Max. Like the Nest Hub Max, it can act as a smart home controller — and I sure hope it paves the way for a better smart home interface. It had better. 
The Nest Hub exemplifies everything that’s gone wrong with smart home controls: its interface is unintuitive and inflexible, its responses are laggy, and its responses are unpredictable and often just plain wrong. 
Google seems to be using the Pixel Tablet as a chance for a do-over. The Pixel Tablet will run Android, and from what we’ve seen so far, it lets you control your smart home directly from the Google Home app, just like you can on any other tablet or smartphone. That’s great for people who buy the Pixel Tablet; the Home app is much more powerful than the Nest Hub interface, and the updated version that’s been in public preview since November comes with powerful new features and increased flexibility. 
It’s clear that Google is gearing up for a big overhaul of the Google Home ecosystem. And no part of the ecosystem needs it more than the dilapidated, half-busted Nest Hub interface. 
It won’t be easy. 
Let’s back up. Right now, Google sells two touchscreen smart displays: the Nest Hub Max, released in 2019, and the second-gen Nest Hub, from 2021. It also still supports the 2018 Nest Hub. All three run the same interface, which has always been a little bit janky but has become increasingly busted as Google adds features and removes others. 
The Nest Hubs have touchscreens, which makes you feel like you ought to be able to interact with them like you would a tablet. But as my colleague Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, The Verge’s resident smart home expert, says, smart displays are really just smart speakers that can show you things: pictures of your kids, YouTube videos, your home cameras, the weather, etc. 
It’s nice that they have screens. The fact that they have touchscreens is misleading, though: it’s nearly always faster and easier to talk to them than to use the touch interface, and you’re more likely to get the results you want.
For the Nest Hub, part of that is down to the design of the interface, which hasn’t meaningfully changed since 2020. The main screen has a series of tabs along the top, and each tab has a bunch of cards on it. There’s an overview page, a home control page, one for media, one for communication, and so forth. But since they have to be large enough to be seen from across the room, the information density is incredibly low, which means lots of swipes and taps to get to anything you might want to do. 
Even if you can manage to navigate the interface to find the thing you want to do, there’s no guarantee the Nest Hub will actually make it happen. Instead of being hard-coded to do the thing you expect them to do, most interface elements send a simulated voice command, which it is up to Google Assistant to parse in real time, based on who’s asking. 
For example, the Nest Hub has a thing that looks like an app drawer, which was added in 2021, and in that drawer is a Games icon (for now). If my editor, Dan Seifert, presses the icon on his Nest Hub Max, it opens the Games pane, which is what it’s supposed to do. If I press Games on my Nest Hub Max, it pulls up the video feed from the Nest cam in my game room, which happens to be named Game Cam. The button does not know what it is supposed to do.
Another example: half the time, the Nest Hub Max can’t hear me say “Hey Google” unless I raise my voice. There’s a slider in the Google Home app labeled “Hey Google” sensitivity. When I increased it by one level on my phone, the Nest Hub Max recited the definition of sensitivity — exactly as if I had said “Hey Google, sensitivity.” I do not know if it actually changed the mic sensitivity.
Google built Duo video calling into the Nest Hub Max, and then it merged Duo with Meet and forgot to tell the Nest Hub, which still has a Duo icon. When I tap my wife’s name in Household Contacts and select video call, the Nest Hub doesn’t know how. Earlier, I asked it to call me by tapping my own profile picture, and it dialed a completely different Nathan Edwards — one of the many guys with my name I have never met but have in my contacts because I get emails intended for them. Just now, I launched Duo from the icon. The Assistant asked, “Who do you want to call?” I said, “Me,” hoping it would send a video call to my phone. Instead, it pulled up a list of Spotify albums and playlists called “me.”
Another big issue here is that you cannot meaningfully customize the interface, either on the device or in the Google Home app. The only way to reorder rooms and devices is to rename them so they show up earlier in the alphabet. Google has finally fixed this in the public preview of the Home app, which allows you to add devices and groups as favorites and — as of a couple weeks ago — reorder them. That option has yet to appear on the Nest Hub.
When Google was pushing games on the Nest Hub, the interface was full of tiles advertising games like Feed My Fish or Baby Shark Stories. I couldn’t dismiss them. I couldn’t even move the tiles further to the right. There was nowhere in the settings where I could disable them, nowhere in the content filters to change them, etc. You could disable news, disable videos, and disable music, but there was no option to disable games. 
Now that games are (thankfully) being deprecated, Google has put a News tile on my interface. Because I live in America, the News tile usually shows either celebrity nonsense or headlines about people getting shot and killed. I cannot change the sources for this News tile, and I cannot get it off of my interface. 
Because of the Nest Hub Max’s limited processing power, the fact that it’s not really designed for touch, and the fact that it has to support multiple users, you have to use the Google Home app on a phone or tablet in order to change most of its settings anyway, and it’s far from clear where any given option lives. Is it in user account settings? Device settings? Assistant settings? Home settings? Nobody knows. 
Take that News tile: I can open Google Home on my phone and tap the card for the Nest Hub Max. From there, I go to Notifications & Digital Wellbeing > Digital Wellbeing > Filters > Nest Hub Max (again) > News & Podcasts and tap Block news. This blocks audio news programs but doesn’t do anything about the News card. 
In order to set up meaningful parental controls — which Google introduced in November 2022, more than three years after I got my Nest Hub Max — I had to create Google accounts for my elementary-aged children and teach the Nest Hub Max to recognize their faces and voices. Enabling parental controls and downtime doesn’t remove unavailable options from the Nest Hub Max. It just means that I heard “Hey Google, play Baby Shark Stories” and “I’m sorry, I can’t do that while content restrictions are on” five hundred times a week until my kids forgot about it. 
There’s also a “meditations to try” tile in case I need to calm down. I’m very calm. Calmer’n you are, dude.  
I could go on.
We know the Pixel Tablet runs Android, and we know that the Google Home app is getting an overhaul, which means the tablet will be far better positioned to do all the things I wish the Nest Hub did better. And from what we’ve seen in previews, the updated Home app itself solves most of my gripes with the Nest Hub interface — for people who buy the Pixel Tablet.
But the Nest Hubs aren’t going anywhere. Unless the Pixel Tablet has a secret Nest speaker in its charging dock — which, to be clear, would rule — you’ll still need a separate Matter controller and Thread border router for your smart home. All the Nest Hubs are Matter controllers, and the second-gen Hub and the Hub Max are also Thread border routers. While Google has other speakers and mesh nodes with Matter controllers (and exactly one other that’s also a Thread border router, the Nest Pro Wi-Fi), it’s unlikely to kill its existing smart displays just because it’s launching a new tablet. 
This is the first I/O since Google incorporated Matter into Google Home, and I would be shocked if Google didn’t mention anything about it. If Google does launch the Pixel Tablet, it’s likely to bring the Google Home app update out of public preview and maybe even launch the script editor at the same time. With a new tablet, a new Home app, and a new Matter focus, it’d be deeply odd to leave the Nest Hub in its current janky state. 
There’s reason to be optimistic. Google has spent the last two years replacing the Nest Hub operating system with Fuchsia OS: the first-gen Nest Hub got it in 2021, the Nest Hub Max in 2022, and the second-gen Nest Hub in May 2023. That means all three Nest Hubs will be running the same code base for the first time in two years, just before Google I/O. Why put in all that work without changing the interface? We’ve been wondering for two years. It could explain (but not excuse) the apparent neglect; why fix something that’s about to be replaced?
The groundwork is there. They’ve got to do something. 
It’s a great time for a fresh start.

352,"At $11,900, Is This Six-Speed 2006 BMW X3 a Three-Pedal Peach?",https://jalopnik.com/at-11-900-is-this-six-speed-2006-bmw-x3-suv-a-deal-1850408018,"The seller of today’s Nice Price or No Dice BMW X3 claims its manual gearbox makes it as “rare as Porsche Cayenne.” Considering it’s being offered in Southern California where every third car seems to be a Cayenne, that might not be the best description. Its price, however, might be well informed.
Automakers sure do like naming their cars after birds. And not just real birds, either, they also leverage bird names from mythology and when those run out, from marketing. The 1990 Pontiac Sunbird we considered last Friday sounds like one of the latter — a made-up bird name — but is, in fact, the name of a real model of bird, a member of the family of Nectariniidae that includes Sunbirds and Spiderhunters. Our Pontiac Sunbird was the real deal too, featuring decent specs and a convertible roof, just in time for summer fun. Most of you thought its $4,500 asking to be a real deal too, as that earned the car a solid 60 percent Nice Price win.
It’s been said that birds of a feather flock together. Contrastingly, another old saw is that opposites attract. When it comes to the vast number of products offered by Germany’s BMW, I think both are true. First off, all of BMW’s cars and trucks feel like BMWs. The company’s ethos of being “The Ultimate Driving Machine” is evident in all its products, no matter what category they occupy. That’s perhaps engendered by a secondary ethos of leveraging the best parts of certain models to imbue that passion in others. That’s how we get vehicles like this 2006 BMW X3 which takes a lot of the best bits from its kissing cousin the 330i to make it one engaging SUV.
Somewhere that's greenGet started on your veggie planting with this 8'x4'x1' garden bed.
The major parts stolen from the 3 Series include the sublimely smooth M54 DOHC straight six and a six-speed manual gearbox. A good bit of 3 Series DNA went into the X3’s suspension design too, so it really is a family affair even if the 3 Series and X3 inhabit totally different segments of the automotive market. See? Opposites attracting.
Here in the X3, the 3.0-liter six makes 228 horsepower and 221 lb-ft of torque. The six-speed matched to that gets an extra sporty M-series shift knob, but the rest of the interior is standard, lacking any sort of sport wheel or extra-grippy seats. That’s ok though, since what is here all looks to be in very decent condition, including a full pixel count on the instrument cluster’s digital display. Above the orderly cabin sits a panoramic moonroof, so big that the roof rack’s forward crossbar can be reached through it in perfect placement for impromptu chin-ups, should the need arise.
With just 126,000 miles on the clock, the exterior seemingly hasn’t had much of a chance to have been banged up either. There is one noticeable dent on the driver’s door, but it otherwise all looks clean right down to the handsome factory alloys. A trailer hitch under the rear bumper serves as a mounting point for what looks to be either a bike rack or an attempt to fend off tailgaters. That’s most likely removable and hence not a permanent risk for backing-up accidents.
According to the ad, the wagon comes with full-service records, all its manuals, and both original keys. It’s never been smoked in, by either people or pets and has an accident-free history. A clean title and newish Yokohama tires might just seal the deal on this Bimmer tall wagon. That is, of course, if we can get past its $11,900 asking price.
What’s your take on the idea of a three-pedal X3 at that kind of money? Does that feel like a good deal for the car as it’s described? Or, in this case, does X not mark the spot?
You decide!

Menachem Elimelech never made peace with reverse osmosis. Elimelech, who founded Yale’s environmental engineering program, is something of a rock star among those who develop filtration systems that turn seawater or wastewater into clean drinking water. And reverse osmosis is a rock star among filter technologies: It has dominated how the world desalinates seawater for about a quarter of a century. Yet nobody really knew how it worked. And Elimelech hated that.
Still, he had to teach the technology to his students. For many years, he showed them how to estimate the high pressures that push the water molecules in seawater across a plastic polyamide membrane, creating pure water on one side of the film and leaving an extra-salty brine on the other. But these calculations relied on an assumption that nagged Elimelech and other engineers: that water molecules diffuse through the membrane individually. “This always bothered me. It does not make any sense,” he says.
This might seem like an arcane engineering question, but Elimelech’s beef with reverse osmosis is based on a real-world problem. Over 3 billion people live in areas where water is scarce. By the year 2030, demand is set to outstrip supply by 40 percent.
And transforming water from salty seas into something potable has always been energy intensive. Older thermal desalination plants in the Gulf States—where energy is plentiful—distill seawater by boiling it and capturing the vapor. A newer generation of reverse osmosis desalination plants, which run the water through an array of plastic membranes, have cut the energy demand a little, but it’s not enough. It still takes a lot of power to push water through dense filters, so even minor improvements in membrane design go a long way.
In a study published in April, Elimelech’s team proved that the once-frustrating assumption about how water moves through a membrane is, indeed, wrong. They replace it with a “solution-friction” theory that water molecules travel in clusters through tiny, transient pores within the polymer, which exert friction on them as they pass through. The physics of that friction matter, because understanding it could help people design membrane materials or structures that make desalination more efficient or better at screening out undesirable chemicals, Elimelech says.
More effective membranes could also improve municipal water systems and expand the reach of desalination. “This is one of those major breakthroughs,” says Steve Duranceau, an environmental engineer at the University of Central Florida, who spent 15 years designing desalination plants before becoming a professor. “This will change the way that people start modeling, and interpreting how to design these systems.”

Max G. Levy

Rhett Allain
“They've nailed it,” agrees Eric Hoek, an environmental engineer at UCLA who trained under Elimelech 20 years ago but was not involved in the study. “Finally, somebody has put the nail in the coffin.”
The roots of the new solution-friction idea are actually old. The molecular math behind it dates to the 1950s and 1960s, when Israeli researchers Ora Kedem and Aharon Katzir-Kachalsky, and UC Berkeley researcher Kurt Samuel Spiegler, derived desalination equations that considered friction—meaning how water, salt, and pores in the plastic membrane interact with each other.
Friction is resistance. In this case, it tells you how hard it is for something to get across the membrane. If you engineer a membrane that has less resistance to water, and more resistance to salt or whatever else you want to remove, you get a cleaner product with potentially less work.
But that model got shelved in 1965, when another group introduced a simpler model. This one assumed that the plastic polymer of the membrane was dense and had no pores through which water could run. It also didn’t hold that friction played a role. Instead, it presumed that water molecules in a saltwater solution would dissolve into the plastic and diffuse out of the other side. For that reason, this is called the “solution-diffusion” model.
Diffusion is the flow of a chemical from where it's more concentrated to where it's less concentrated. Think of a drop of dye spreading throughout a glass of water, or the smell of garlic wafting out of a kitchen. It keeps moving toward equilibrium until its concentration is the same everywhere, and it doesn’t rely on a pressure difference, like the suction that pulls water through a straw.
The model stuck, but Elimelech always suspected it was wrong. To him, accepting that water diffuses through the membrane implied something strange: that the water scattered into individual molecules as it passed through. “How can it be?” Elimelech asks. Breaking up clusters of water molecules requires a ton of energy. “You almost need to evaporate the water to get it into the membrane.”
Still, Hoek says, “20 years ago it was anathema to suggest that it was incorrect.” Hoek didn’t even dare to use the word “pores” when talking about reverse osmosis membranes, since the dominant model didn’t acknowledge them. “For many, many years,” he says wryly, “I've been calling them ‘interconnected free volume elements.’”
Over the past 20 years, images taken using advanced microscopes have reinforced Hoek and Elimelech’s doubts. Researchers discovered that the plastic polymers used in desalination membranes aren’t so dense and poreless after all. They actually contain interconnected tunnels—although they are absolutely minuscule, peaking at around 5 angstroms in diameter, or half a nanometer. Still, one water molecule is about 1.5 angstroms long, so that’s enough room for small clusters of water molecules to squeeze through these cavities, instead of having to go one at a time.
About two years ago, Elimelech felt the time was right to take down the solution-diffusion model. He worked with a team: Li Wang, a postdoc in Elimelech’s lab, examined fluid flow through small membranes to take real measurements. Jinlong He, at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, tinkered with a computer model simulating what happens at the molecular scale as pressure pushes salt water through a membrane.

Predictions based on a solution-diffusion model would say that water pressure should be the same on both sides of the membrane. But in this experiment, the team found that the pressure at the entrance and exit of the membrane differed. This suggested that pressure drives water flow through the membrane, rather than simple diffusion.
They also found that water travels in clusters through the interconnected pores, which, though tiny, are large enough that the water doesn’t have to scatter into single molecules to squeeze through. Those pores seemed to appear and disappear across the membrane over time, thanks to the applied pressure and natural molecular motion.
Depending on the membrane material, these pores interact differently with water, salt, or other compounds. Elimelech thinks engineers could design membranes to better reject salt (by maximizing how much the pores interact with them) or reduce friction with water (by making the pores less attracted to it, so it slips on by). Making it easier to separate the two means you could use less pressure and reduce energy cost.
Or, he thinks, engineers could tailor membranes to filter out environmental nasties, like boron and chlorides. Roughly 20 percent of boron from seawater slips through membranes as boric acid. That quantity is safe for people but potentially toxic for crops that are irrigated with wastewater. In Israel, water purification plants have to take extra detoxifying steps just to cut out the boron and chlorides in water used for agriculture. If you can filter these out on the initial pass, Elimelech says, “You can save on capital costs and energy.”
Hoek thinks the idea is plausible—but not quite there yet. (His colleagues recently explored designing membranes for boron rejection.) Engineers might tinker with channel size, local pH, or electrical charges on the membrane pores, he suggests.
And this may go beyond boron, chloride, or even desalination. Municipal utility plants use reverse osmosis to remove hazardous PFAS “forever chemicals” from drinking water. Current membranes are still regarded as the best approach, but many researchers are determined to design better ones to capture the toxic compounds.
Duranceau dreams of membranes that are as flexible and customizable as clothing—which can be selected based on whatever the user needs. After all, membranes are plastics, the paragon of customizability. Maybe, the engineers think, this knowledge will lead to membranes made of materials other than polyamide that would be better at screening out PFAS or lead. Or perhaps the membrane one chooses will depend on how salty the water is—from brackish to brine.
That may take a while—Elimelech even wonders if it would be best to use an algorithm to search for a membrane material that can beat polyamide, the way biotech companies have turned to machine learning to screen for new drugs. “But it's very challenging,” he points out, because in the last 40-odd years, no one has found anything better. At least now, though, the science of water flow is running clear.

355,Stardew-like meets murder mystery Grave Seasons has some supernatural secrets still to come | Rock Paper Shotgun,https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stardew-like-meets-murder-mystery-grave-seasons-has-some-supernatural-secrets-still-to-come,"Developers Perfect Garbage tease a few details
Last month Rachel made us aware of a life sim called Grave Seasons, a kind of mash up of perennial favourite Stardew Valley and, er, the half-season serial killer arc of a police procedural TV show. Naturally this turned my head, like Tarantino walking past a ladies shoe store, and I emailed the developers Perfect Garbage to find out a bit more. They describe the game as ""fun, campy and spooky"" and hint at yet more secrets to be revealed. Appropriate for a game where, every time you start a new run, one of the townsfolk starts killing everyone else.
Studio director and co-founder Son M. (who first caught Rachel's eye by posting some fun screenshots on Twitter tells me that Grave Seasons is in early development - and indeed, Perfect Garbage have a cyberpunk visual novel called Love Shore coming down the game-release pipeline, due for release later this year (there's a demo on Steam right now).
My main question was asking for the team's elevator pitch on the game, which I will reproduce in full below: 
The word supernatural really stands out for me there. We already knew that there would be murders of course - one of the screenshots Son M. shared shows the player's journal, where they can keep track of who has been killed and their relationships with the townsfolk - but supernatural puts a different spin on it for me. Is the motive supernatural? Is this some Lovecraft shit again, because that's been in for a while?
Speaking of relationships, as well as it being possible to accidentally romance the murderer, I have confirmation that you can also romance a character in Grave Seasons only to see them get absolutely done in. Your relationships with the townsfolk are also one of the planned ways you can gather clues to solve the mystery, which also include ""participating in life in the village and examining the patterns to each murder"". 
It sounds like the intention with Grave Seasons is going full ham with the murder mystery element, making it feel more authored even where it isn't. But the life sim side is going to have a bunch of hashtag content too. ""There's a bit more to Grave Seasons than farming,"" and the team estimate the ratio of life sim tasks to ""spooky town mystery"" to be about 50:50.
Obviously this is very early days for Grave Seasons yet, but I'm excited to see more, and it sounds like Perfect Garbage are excited to show more when they can. ""Reception to Grave Seasons has been really wonderful, and we're really looking forward to bringing in fun, campy, and spooky vibes to a genre of games we already enjoy,"" says Son M. ""Plus, there's some funky secret mechanics we can't wait to showcase."" Funky secret mechanics combined with the murders being supernatural has got me all riled up. Or maybe you get to do Batman detecto-vision like in the Arkham Games. Who knows? The future is an open book. We'll keep checking in with Grave Seasons. The road to development is long, but it's interesting.

356,Delete these apps NOW: Android users are urged to check their phones | Daily Mail Online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-12058975/Delete-apps-Android-users-urged-check-phones.html,"By Jonathan Chadwick For Mailonline

Android users have been urged to delete 'malicious' apps from their phones that have been secretly signing them up for paid subscriptions.
Security firm Kaspersky found 11 apps on the Google Play Store with snazzy designs and logos that are actually a devious new type of malware, called Fleckpe. 
The apps, which are mostly related to photo and video editing, have names including Photo Effect Editor and Beauty Slimming Photo Editor. 
While they've now been removed from Google Play, they have already been installed on more than 620,000 devices worldwide and been used to take users' money without permission.
Although Apple devices are unaffected because they use a different app store, the tech giant recently had to issue a security update of its own. 
The apps, which are mostly related to photo and video editing, have names including Photo Effect Editor and Beauty Slimming Photo Editor
According to Kaspersky, this particular new type of malware is being distributed as a Trojan – a type of seemingly innocuous software that later reveals its malicious intent. 
- com.impressionism.prozs.app
- com.picture.pictureframe
- com.beauty.slimming.pro
- com.beauty.camera.plus.photoeditor
- com.microclip.vodeoeditor
- com.gif.camera.editor
- com.apps.camera.photos
- com.toolbox.photoeditor 
- com.hd.h4ks.wallpaper
- com.draw.graffiti
- com.urox.opixe.nightcamreapro 
In response to the report, a Google spokesperson told MailOnline: 'We take security and privacy claims against apps seriously, and if we find that an app has violated our policies, we take appropriate action. 
'Users are also protected by Google Play Protect, which can warn users or block identified malicious apps on Android devices.' 
Kaspersky has provided a list of the 11 apps' package names – the code that uniquely identifies each one on devices and the Google Play store. 
Anyone with the 11 apps installed on their phone or tablet should delete them without delay, because they sign users up to a paid subscription option without their knowledge. 
'Every once in a while, someone will come across malicious apps on Google Play that seem harmless at first,' said Dmitry Kalinin, developer at Kaspersky, in a report. 
'Some of the trickiest of these are subscription Trojans, which often go unnoticed until the user finds they have been charged for services they never intended to buy.
'This kind of malware often finds its way into the official marketplace for Android apps.
'Our latest discovery, which we call ""Fleckpe"", also spreads via Google Play as part of photo editing apps, smartphone wallpaper packs and so on.' 
Kaspersky thinks this particular malware has targeted users from Thailand, although there have also been victims in Poland, Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore. 
Security firm Kaspersky found eleven Fleckpe-infected apps on Google Play that have been installed on more than 620,000 devices
Kaspersky has provided a list of the apps' package names – the code that uniquely identifies each one on devices and the Google Play store
Data suggests the Fleckpe malware has been active since 2022, and although the apps have since been removed from Google Play, they will still be present on thousands of Android devices. 
Apple issued the first of a new type of security update to iPhones, iPads and Macs
'All of the apps had been removed from the marketplace by the time our report was published,' Kalinin said. 
'But the malicious actors might have deployed other, as yet undiscovered, apps, so the real number of installations could be higher.' 
The expert described how each of the apps secretly installs a payload that is able to open a paid subscription page in an 'invisible' web browser. 
The Trojan opens the page in this browser and attempts to subscribe on the user's behalf without them knowing. 
'The victim proceeds to use the app's legitimate functionality – for example, installs wallpapers or edits photos, unaware of the fact that they are being subscribed to a paid service,' Kalinin said.
In recent years, subscription Trojans like these have only gained in popularity with scammers, the expert concluded. 
'Their operators have increasingly turned to official marketplaces like Google Play to spread their malware,' he said. 
'Growing complexity of the Trojans has allowed them to successfully bypass many anti-malware checks implemented by the marketplaces, remaining undetected for long periods of time.'  
Malware - a catch-all term for any type of malicious software - has been used to steal data, spy on citizens and attack national infrastructure (file photo)
'Affected users often fail to discover the unwanted subscriptions right away, let alone find out how they happened in the first place. 
'All this makes subscription Trojans a reliable source of illegal income in the eyes of cybercriminals.' 
Kalinin said Android users should 'be cautious with apps' even though they look legitimate and are on Google Play.
Users should also avoid giving permissions to apps that they 'should not have' and install an antivirus product capable of detecting this type of Trojans.
Some of these apps can even look legitimate but may have been hijacked so that they can be modified to steal private information. 
According to another security firm called MalwareFox, cyber criminals can download apps from Google's store and manipulate them.
Last year, Google warned that a type of spyware – software that steals information from a device – was used by the Italian and Kazakhstani governments to spy on private messages.  
Google warned of spyware being used by foreign governments to hack into Apple and Android phones and snoop on users' activities. 
The 'spyware' – software that steals information from a device – was created by Milan-based company RCS Lab, Google and security firm Lookout said. 
RCS Lab spyware has allegedly been used by the Italian and Kazakhstani governments to spy on private messages and contacts stored on their citizens' smartphones. 
RCS Lab is an example of a 'lawful intercept' company that claims to only sell to customers with legitimate use for surveillance, such as intelligence and law enforcement agencies. 
But in reality, such tools have often been abused under the guise of national security to spy on business executives, human rights activists, journalists, academics and government officials, security experts say. 

It's thought RCS Lab's spyware, nicknamed 'Hermit', is distributed via SMS messages that appear to come from legitimate sources.

    This slim 15-inch Windows-based MacBook Pro competitor, with its Nvidia 4070 GPU, is a great way to mix work and fun.
  
One of my favorite laptop tricks is finding a system that can play games, and play them well, without looking and feeling like a gaming machine. Among the top performers in this stealthy category is the Dell XPS 15, which looks and feels like a MacBook Pro alternative but also is capable of performance as good as that of many gaming laptops. 
But those gaming chops are just a bonus. The real appeal here is that this is a slim, sleek system for creative pros looking to do photo and video editing or design work. Razer's Blade laptops cover some of the same ground, but without the crossover office-ready look and feel of the XPS 15. 
Clad in a light silver-gray, with a textured wrist rest and big touchpad, the XPS 15 would look just as home in a coffee shop as in a boardroom. A MacBook Pro, in either its 14-inch or 16-inch version, also combines an excellent display with lots of both CPU and GPU power, but Apple systems are notoriously gamer-unfriendly if that's important to you. 
The model reviewed here is a high-end one, with an Intel Core i7-13700H, 32GB of RAM, 1TB SSD, and an Nvidia RTX 4070 GPU. That configuration is $2,799, and trading up to an even faster Intel Core i9 brings it up to $2,949. The XPS 15 currently starts at $1,499 with a Core i7 CPU, Intel Arc graphics, 512GB SSD and a regular non-touch 1,920x1,200 LCD. 
One thing the XPS 15 offers that many of its competitors do not is a touchscreen OLED display. These screens have become more common in laptops over the past few years but are still not the norm. On the plus side, an OLED display offers excellent brightness and contrast and can look fantastic for gaming and video viewing. On the other hand, the 3,456x2,160 OLED option in the XPS 15 is locked to a 60Hz refresh rate, while gamers are increasingly demanding higher refresh rates. 
Still, the display looks great, and in keeping with the rest of the modern XPS line, it has a very thin border around the screen -- Dell calls this its Infinity Edge, which just means really thin bezel. But having that very thin top border around the screen might be why this system is still stuck with a 720-resolution webcam, which is frankly unacceptable in an otherwise top-shelf laptop like this. 
The body is, like many premium laptops, cut from solid aluminum blocks for durability, and the screen has a Gorilla Glass coating as well. On top of the aluminum chassis is a carbon fiber top layer, which has the distinctive XPS pattern along the wrist rest. It's the same as last year's XPS 15, so this 2023 version basically just updates the available components inside. However, the keyboard remains a key feature, with large keycaps and good tactile feedback, without being overly clacky. 
While slim laptops are dropping ports at a rapid rate, the XPS 15 is sitting in the middle ground. It has three USB-C ports, plus a headphone jack and a full-size SD card slot. That means it's missing USB-A, HDMI or anything else, although Dell packs a tiny USB-C hub in the box. 
Power is via USB-C, so nearly any similar charger will work, which is a rarity for a system with a powerful GPU, but if you use an underpowered charging brick, the system will alert you. It'll still work, but the charging may not be able to keep up with intense GPU use, for example. 
I used the XPS 15 for some photo and video editing, using Photoshop and Premiere, and found it worked flawlessly, although based on these high-end specs, I expected nothing less. The bright screen helped with my photo editing, although the good-but-not-great touchpad made me miss MacBook Photoshop navigation. 
With an Nvidia 4070, this is by default a high-end gaming laptop as well (and costs about the same as a comparable high-end 4070 crossover gaming system like the Razer Blade). In addition to our regular benchmark tests, I ran several current games on it, from Hogwarts Legacy to Marvel's Midnight Suns to Star Wars: Jedi Survivor. All ran smoothly, even the poorly optimized Jedi Survivor. It helps that the screen's 60Hz refresh rate keeps you from worrying about higher frame rates, but I found it was helpful to play at a lower resolution, like 2,560x1,200, instead of the full near-4K resolution. 
The only catch is that this is a lower-power 40-watt version of the 4070 GPU, while the larger XPS 17 has access to the more powerful 60-watt version. For FHD gaming, however, it should make a big difference. Also keep in mind that if you're primarily using this for creative work, you'll want to download the latest Studio drivers from Nvidia (which come pre-installed), rather than the usual gaming drivers. 
I love being able to play games at serious detail settings on a conservative-looking laptop, and to be able to get away with just a simple USB-C charger. It's about 4.25 pounds, so it's not a laptop you'll want to carry around every day in a shoulder bag. For a bigger screen at a light weight, look at something like LG's excellent Gram line. With its big, high-res OLED screen and powerful components, I see the XPS 15 as a good Windows-based alternative to a MacBook Pro, or as a semi-desktop-replacement system for your home office. ",1

359,Google's Nearby Share app for Windows is now available globally - SamMobile,https://www.sammobile.com/news/google-nearby-share-app-windows-os-available-globally/,"© 2023 SamMobile

Last updated: May 8th, 2023 at 12:30 UTC+02:00 
At CES 2023, Google released Nearby Share for Windows, allowing people to easily transfer files between Android and Windows devices. Back then, however, the app was available only in a few countries, which included the United States. Well, Google seems to have been working hard to add more regions to the list, as the Nearby Share app for Windows is now available to download in most countries across the globe.

Spotted by 9To5Google, Google’s support page for the feature states, “Nearby Share Beta for Windows PCs is available in the US and most countries globally.” The only countries where you cannot download the app are Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria. Mind you, Nearby Share for Windows works without any issues, but it is still in the beta stage, and Google hasn’t announced when we can expect a stable version of the app.

You should also know that it doesn’t work on ARM-powered Windows devices yet. It only runs on 64-bit Windows 10/11 for now. If you have a compatible Windows device, it’s pretty easy to set up the app.

Just download the app from the official page, install it on your Windows machine, log in with the same Google account that’s on your Android device, and voila, you can now transfer files between the two devices easily. Just make sure both the devices are on the same Wi-Fi network, Bluetooth is turned on, and these devices are within 16 feet of each other.

Samsung also has an app for Windows that offers the same functionality as Nearby Share called Quick Share. Like Google’s app, Quick Share allows people to transfer files between Galaxy smartphone/tablet and Windows PC. Plus, it comes with many other features, including the ability to mirror your smartphone’s screen directly on the Windows device.

360,Gran Turismo 7 Daily Races: The Route X Factor – GTPlanet,https://www.gtplanet.net/gran-turismo-7-daily-races-20230508/,"Gran Turismo 7’s latest set of Daily Races is now available, with three new races across the next seven days and something that’s just a little bit different from the standard offering.
That comes in Race A, which remains a “No DR/SR Updates” event as we’ve seen for almost a year now. No matter how well, or badly, your race goes, neither your Driver Rating nor Sportsmanship Rating will be affected by the event.
We’re heading to Special Stage Route X, an enormous and fictional oval circuit which consists of two giant straights and two banked corners and comes in at 18.8 miles long. That means no braking is necessary, and it’s just a full-throttle blast for the one-lap event.
If that wasn’t quite strange enough, you’ll be driving one of ten cars only and they’ll be provided to you in a pre-tuned form — so don’t take standard performance as a guide — on Comfort Soft tires. 
You’ll need to select from the Bugatti Chiron, Chevrolet Corvette C6 ZR1, Dodge Viper GTS, Lamborghini Aventador SV, Mercedes-AMG GT Black Series, Nissan Skyline R34 GT-R, Nissan GT-R Nismo, Pagani Huayra, RE Amemiya RX-7, and the Toyota Supra RZ Mk4. 
They’re closely matched for the most part, so just pick your favorite car to listen to for the 270-second race at 270mph. It’ll be a non-stop slipstream battle, with the only real tactic being when to make a break for the front — with nitrous enabled — and to avoid a high-speed collision with the pit-lane entry!
After that, Race B will be a thankfully simple event. It’s a standard sprint race for Gr.3 cars, on Racing Hard tires, so just select the car of your choice from this GT3-like category and go racing.
The new Nurburgring Sprint circuit will host the cars for the six-lap race. That means you’ll need to be aware of the cut-through between turns five and ten, and the much earlier braking point there. Otherwise it’s a pretty straightforward event.
For Race C you’ll be heading to the southernmost circuit in the game, at Australia’s Mount Panorama, and an eight-lap race in the Gr.4 category vehicles.
You’ll need to choose wisely this week, as there’s a high fuel consumption multiplier. This is set at 6x, so your tank will drain six times quicker than usual — making this equivalent to a 48-lap race. For some cars no amount of fuel-saving will stop you from needing to hit the pits, but you’ll want to be immobile while the mechanics fill it up again for the least possible time so a car with decent fuel consumption will be a better choice.
There’s also considerations of tires. Both Racing Hard and Racing Medium compounds are available, but the Hard grade is mandatory: you’ll need to use it for at least one pass of the start-finish line on track or you’ll receive a one-minute penalty at the end of the race.
Not only that, there’s a 3x tire wear multiplier — so again, your tires will wear three times faster, equivalent to a 24-lap race. That means you’ll need maximize the time you’re on the grippier Mediums but not wear them out so much they’re worse than new Hards.
In order to access the Daily Races, you’ll need to unlock Sport Mode, by completing Menu Book 9 (“Championship: Tokyo Highway Parade”) in the GT Cafe single player hub.
With GT7’s Daily Races updating every Monday across the game’s life to date, the next new set should arrive on Monday May 15.

Samsung, once again, ranked second in the global tablet market. It is also the world’s biggest tablet brand in the Android segment, while Apple is comfortably leading the overall tablet market globally. While tablet sales fell in Q1 2023 compared to Q1 2022, the overall sales are still higher than pre-COVID-19 levels, which clearly shows that consumer demand for tablets has increased over the past few years.

According to IDC’s numbers, Samsung shipped 7.1 million tablets in Q1 2023, which is a 14.3% drop compared to Q1 2022. Apple shipped 10.8 million tablets during Q1 2023, which is a 10.2% drop compared to the same period last year. Huawei shipped 2 million tablets (around 6.6% market share), but its sales are still largely limited to the Chinese market. Lenovo saw a massive drop in shipments as it shipped just 1.9 million tablets in Q1 2023 compared to 3 million shipments the previous year.

Amazon, despite seeing a massive 62% drop, is somehow still in the top five rankings with 1.4 million shipments. It sells low-cost Fire series tablets with a custom version of Android largely in the US. With the launch of more tablets from the likes of OnePlus, OPPO, Realme, and Vivo, it looks like the tablet market has seen a much-needed refresh. Even Google will launch its first Pixel-branded Android tablet later this month.

Samsung will launch three more high-end tablets—Galaxy Tab S9, Galaxy Tab S9+, and Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra—sometime in July or August of 2023. These tablets are expected to bring impressive Super AMOLED screens and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 For Galaxy processor. The higher-end models will feature an IP67 rating for dust and water resistance.

363,Google Pixel Fold gets a launch date - Gizchina.com,https://www.gizchina.com/2023/05/07/google-pixel-fold-gets-a-launch-date/,"Google will hold the 2023 I/O conference on May 10. At this event, the company will officially it’s latest high – end mobile phone series. This will be the Google Pixel 8 series. In addition to this series, it will also launch the new Google Pixel Fold. This will be the first time that the company will try its hands on a foldable device. There is already an official render of this device showing its design and shape.

The Google Pixel Fold will use the design style of the Pixel series. On the rear, this device will use the same long bar design with a small bulge just like the Pixel series. This device comes with three camera lenses on the bar. The frame is very round, and the grip should be more comfortable.
According to reports, the Pixel Fold’s three-camera sensors are a 64MP main camera (IMX787), a 10.8MP telephoto camera (S5K3J1), and a 12MP wide-angle camera (IMX386). At the same time, the outer screen uses a 5.8-inch OLED screen, and the inner screen is a 7.6-inch OLED screen. Both screens support a refresh rate of 120Hz.
In addition, the new mobile phone will come with Google’s own Tensor G2 chip. It will also use a dedicated Titan M2 security chip with 12GB of RAM and 256GB or 512GB of UFS 3.1 storage. Google plans to start the Pixel Fold pre – order activity after the official release on May 10. However, this device will start shipping at the end of June.

The Google Pixel Fold is one of the most anticipated mobile phones of 2023. It is Google’s first foldable phone, and it is expected to compete with other foldable phones like the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 and the Huawei Mate X2. Let us now take a look at what we know about the Google Pixel Fold, including its design, features, release date, and price.
The Google Pixel Fold is expected to have a similar design to the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4. It will have a cover display on the outside and a larger, tablet-like display when folded. The phone is expected to be wider than the Galaxy Z Fold 4, with a square-ish look from the front when unfolded. It will be made out of glass and metal, giving it a premium feel. The phone is also expected to be “really heavy”.
The Google Pixel Fold is expected to have a 7.6-inch foldable OLED display with a resolution of 2208 x 2480 pixels. It will be powered by a Tensor G2 chip and come with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. This device will also have a triple – camera setup on the back, with a 64MP primary sensor, a 10.8MP ultra-wide sensor, and a 12MP telephoto sensor. The phone is expected to have a 12MP front-facing camera. Under the hood, there will be a 4,500 mAh battery with support for fast charging and wireless charging.

We expect features like face unlock, 90-120 Hz refresh rate, IP68 water resistance ratings, and glass backs for wireless charging. This device should also support reverse wireless charging, allowing users to charge other devices wirelessly using the Pixel Fold.
The Google Pixel Fold is expected to run on Android 14, which should have features like expanded Smart Reply, Focus mode, and improved voice recognition. It will use a custom interface designed specifically for the foldable display. The device is also expected to feature several software features unique to the Pixel lineup, including Google Assistant, Pixel-exclusive camera features, and Google’s machine learning algorithms for improved performance and battery life.
One rumored feature of the Pixel Fold is a new multitasking mode, which would allow users to run multiple apps simultaneously on the larger display. This would be a significant improvement over current smartphones, which are limited to split-screen multitasking.

The release date for the Google Pixel Fold is May 10th but shipment will start in June. The price of the phone is also not yet confirmed, but it is expected to be anywhere between $1,300 and $1,500, according to a leaker on Twitter, Yogesh Bear.
The Pixel Fold’s potential impact on the market will depend on several factors, including its pricing and availability. Foldable phones are currently priced at a premium. The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 is priced at $1,999 and the Huawei Mate Xs is priced at €2,499. If the Pixel Fold is priced similarly, it may be challenging to attract users who are not willing to pay such a high price for a smartphone.
However, Google has a reputation for offering high-quality products at an affordable price point. This could make the Pixel Fold a more attractive option for users. The company could also leverage its strong brand recognition and marketing expertise. These would be very useful in positioning the Pixel Fold as a desirable and innovative product.
The Google Pixel Fold is one of the most anticipated smartphones of 2023. It is Google’s first foldable phone, and it is expected to compete with major rivals. The likes of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 and the Huawei Mate X2 are surely on the list. In terms of design, it will be very similar to the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4. The device will have a cover display on the outside and a larger, tablet-like display when it folds. We will have a 7.6 – inch foldable OLED screen but the chip will be Google Tensor G2 chip. The chip should not be much of an issue since foldable phone buyers do not focus on performance.

364,'Darkest Dungeon II' arrives on Steam next week | Engadget,https://www.engadget.com/darkest-dungeon-ii-arrives-on-steam-next-week-215102646.html,"After almost two years of early access and more than five years after it was first announced, Darkest Dungeon II is ready for release. Red Hook Studios announced this week that version 1.0 of the sequel to its hit 2016 RPG will arrive on the Epic Games Store and Steam, where the game was previously unavailable, on May 8th. For fans who already own Darkest Dungeon on Valve’s storefront, Red Hook said it would offer a limited-time discount on its new game.
Even if you’ve spent some time playing the game in early access, the 1.0 release has something for you. The public release adds one playable character and the game’s final two story acts. As with Darkest Dungeon, Red Hook is promising plenty of post-launch support. In the future, the studio said fans can look forward to quality-of-life improvements, the addition of new monsters and hero skins, ongoing balance tuning and, most notably, mod support.",1
365,Genetically Modified Houseplants Are Here,https://www.newser.com/story/334877/genetic-tweaks-may-make-plants-better-air-cleaners.html,"
                                    A French biotech company wants to clear the air—literally. Neoplants introduced its genetically-engineered pothos plants late last year, touting the plant's ability to metabolize indoor air pollutants often missed by traditional air purifiers, reports MIT's Technology Review. The pollutants, known as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), are often emitted by sources like paint, gas stoves, and building materials. Neoplants claims that its innovative pothos variant, called Neo P1, in addition to being a tough and aesthetically appealing houseplant, provides a significant improvement in indoor air quality.
                                

                                    Neoplants's cofounder, Patrick Torbey, explained the company's ""two-pronged approach"" to Technology Review. First comes tweaking how the plant metabolizes nutrients by adding new genes that cause the plant to make new enzymes that help to absorb VOCs. This allows the pollution to actually aid in creating additional plant material which starts a cycle of steadily increasing pollutant absorption. Next, the Neoplant process adds bacteria strains that help transform toxic substances like benzene and toluene into life-supporting amino acids and sugars.
                                

                                    On its website, the company claims these changes make Neo P1 ""equivalent to up to 30 regular houseplants in terms of air purification."" Wired notes that field tests outside a lab setting are on the horizon in regard to that boast. New Atlas adds that Neo P1 comes in its own specially-designed potting soil that has been enhanced by biochar, which is a kind of charcoal that can aid—along with supplements Neoplants calls Power Drops—propagating helpful microorganisms. Torbey tells MIT that while his company is starting small with houseplants, they believe this technology could one day help the entire world. ""I’ll be disappointed,"" he says, ""if there’s a plant on the moon and it’s not a Neoplant.""  (Read more clean air stories.)

366,Twitter says a 'security incident' led to private Circle tweets becoming public | Engadget,https://www.engadget.com/twitter-says-a-security-incident-led-to-private-circle-tweets-becoming-public-164954799.html,"Back in April, users found a bug with Twitter’s Circle feature that saw the platform expose private tweets to strangers. Now, nearly a month later, the company has finally commented on the issue. In an email seen by The Guardian, Twitter told affected users the exposure was the result of “a security incident that occured earlier this year.”
The company claims the issue was “immediately fixed.” It also shared an apology. “Twitter is committed to protecting the privacy of the people who use our service, and we understand the risks that an incident like this can introduce and we deeply regret this happened,” the company said. When news of the exposure first started circulating online, some, including creator Theo Brown, speculated the issue was the result of Twitter failing to filter Circle tweets out of its recommendation algorithm. Twitter has not operated a communications department since Elon Musk's first round of layoffs, and the company did not initially acknowledge the issue.
More broadly, Twitter has dealt with a growing number of technical issues since Musk’s takeover of the company in October. The billionaire has reduced the company’s workforce by at least 60 percent, gutting many of its technical teams of senior leadership. Over that time, Twitter has suffered multiple outages and otherwise created confusion over feature rollouts and removals.",1
367,Overwatch 2 players pull off insane “uno reverse card” trick with Lifeweaver - Dexerto,https://www.dexerto.com/overwatch/overwatch-2-players-pull-off-insane-uno-reverse-card-trick-with-lifeweaver-2137169/,"News, reviews, tips and guides for the biggest and best games
While Lifeweaver has received a lot of changes since release, but players are starting to get the hang of him.
Overwatch 2 players have managed to discover a new interaction between Junker Queen and Lifeweaver that ruined one Roadhog player’s day.
Lifeweaver has been out for a while now, and although he’s received more changes on release than any other champion before him, players are getting better at using his abilities properly.
This is especially true for his most controversial ability: Life Grip, which allows him to pull allies to safety, but also risks messing up their engage or strategy if you’re not on the same page.
But this Junker Queen player pulled off the perfect knife throw as they were being rescued by their support, making for a clutch elimination on the enemy tank.
In a post on the Overwatch 2 subreddit, one player showed off a trick they used to play an “uno reverse” against the enemy tank.
The clip begins with a Junker Queen player pushing onto the point on Nepal, a map infamous for its large death pit. The enemy Roadhog, looking to capitalize on this, hooks the Junker Queen into the pit, which would mean a guaranteed death in any other situation.
However, the Junker Queen’s ally Lifeweaver was thankfully paying attention to the fight, and immediately  pulled her to safety from across the map.

As she flew back to the edge, the Junker Queen threw her dagger at the Hog and recalled it, pulling him into the pit that he had tried pushing the Queen into.
Other Overwatch players praised the Junker Queen’s quick thinking, with one viewer saying: “That was awesome! We should always keep a knife in Hog’s belly, just in case.”
Another said: “I thought Lifeweaver pulling Bob out of the pit after I hooked it off this same point was impressive, this is just next level.”
