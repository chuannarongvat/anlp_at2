I graded all the Round 7 picks below, plus all the other Day 2 and Day 3 selections.\\n\\nIf you want to do all that plus track the best available prospects and get access to every pick in the draft on one page, you can in our draft tracker.\\n\\nGrades: Round 1 • Round 2 • Round 3 • Round 4 • Round 5 • Round 6 • Round 7\\n\\n218. Bears: Travis Bell, DL, Kennesaw State\\n\\nGrade: C\\n\\nClassic small-school undersized three-technique rusher who tested his way into the draft. Needs to get stronger and will take time to learn how to dispatch NFL blockers.\\n\\n219. Lions: Antoine Green, WR, North Carolina\\n\\nGrade: A\\n\\nDraft crush of mine. Tall, decently filled out, explosive YAC specialist on the outside who showcased plus ball-tracking skill as a leaper down the field. Has all the talent and nuance to be a more productive pro than he was in college.\\n\\n220. Jets: Zack Kuntz, TE, Old Dominion\\n\\nGrade: A\\n\\nMost athletic TE in the class and plays to it on the field. Looks like an enormous WR on the field. Not quite as good in contested-catch scenarios as his size would indicate. Can separate at the next level. If he stays healthy, this is a great value pick.\\n\\n221. Colts: Jaylon Jones, CB, Texas A&amp;M\\n\\nGrade: B-\\n\\nSavvy zone cornerback. Dynamic movements. Plants and drives on the football underneath. OK tackler.\\n\\n222. Vikings: DeWayne McBride, RB, UAB\\n\\nGrade: A\\n\\nCould be one of the biggest steals in the class. Feature-back size and has the complete skill set to be very elusive at the next level. Not crazy fast but has juice. Compact balance is awesome. Plus value pick.\\n\\n223. Rams: Ethan Evans, P, Wingate\\n\\nGrade: C\\n\\nBest small-school punter in the class. Big frame with monster leg. Directional kicks need work.\\n\\n224. Falcons: DeMarcco Hellams, S, Alabama\\n\\nGrade: B-\\n\\nHellams is an experienced defensive back coming out of a Nick Saban-coached secondary. He has good awareness and understands route patterns, but lacks ideal top end and recovery speed. Maxed out athleticism with a solid floor. (Josh Edwards)\\n\\n225. Falcons: Jovaughn Gwyn, IOL, South Carolina\\n\\nGrade: B+\\n\\nOverachieving interior blocker with size and length deficiencies. Wall-off blocker who battles hard. Low center of gravity helps his power. Good IOL depth for Falcons.\\n\\n226. Jaguars: Cooper Hodges, OL, Appalachian State\\n\\nGrade: D+\\n\\nBattler at OT who'll probably move inside to guard at the next level. Quality but unspectacular athleticism. Needs to get stronger to move people backward at the next level. Best getting lateral. Lunges pop in pass pro\\n\\n227. Jaguars: Raymond Vohasek, DL, North Carolina\\n\\nGrade: C-\\n\\nInterior DL with NFL size and close to NFL power. Flexibility and burst are lower-level. Not overly athletic. Powerful levers he uses well.\\n\\n228. Titans: Colton Dowell, WR, Tennessee-Martin\\n\\nGrade: C-\\n\\nClassic outside WR size and was big-time tested. Productive at small-school level. Will have to acclimate to the speed, quickness and strength of NFL CBs. Big leap for him in those regards.\\n\\n229. Ravens: Andrew Vorhees, IOL, USC\\n\\nGrade: C+\\n\\nProbably would've been an early Day 3 pick had he not tore a knee ligament during the pre-draft process. Super-experienced guard with good power. Balance and accuracy at second level is a little underwhelming. Very Ravens selection. Redshirt season in 2023.\\n\\n230. Bills: Nick Broeker, OT, Ole Miss\\n\\nGrade: B\\n\\nKing of winning ugly up front. Played OT and OG at Ole Miss. Good power to his game and will work tirelessly to recover. Anchor is quality. Short-area quickness is impressive.\\n\\n231. Raiders: Nesta Jade Silvera, DL, Arizona State\\n\\nGrade: B+\\n\\nFun, undersized up-the-field rusher. Slippery type. Not a great athlete and lacks length. Gets washed out against the run often.\\n\\n232. Packers: Carrington Valentine, CB, Kentucky\\n\\nGrade: A-\\n\\nTall, nasty, athletic cornerback who wants to get under the WR's skin. Incredibly physical at the line. Has recovery speed if beaten. Didn't have much ball production and his wild style leads to missed tackles. High-upside flier.\\n\\n233. Commanders: Andre Jones, EDGE, Louisiana\\n\\nGrade: C\\n\\nVersatile LB who plays a physical style. But his power his inconsistent. Old-school downhill type who works well in the box but lacks in coverage.\\n\\n234. Rams: Jason Taylor II, S, Oklahoma State\\n\\nGrade: B+\\n\\nElite tester who's not quite as explosive and speedy on film. Plenty of experience as slot defender and from a deep middle safety. Ball skills are there. Occasionally reacts to routes a tick late. Tackling is average.\\n\\n235. Packers: Lew Nichols III, RB, Central Michigan\\n\\nGrade: C\\n\\nNichols has the size of an NFL feature back and is willing to fight through contact. He has good pass-catching ability but there is room for improvement in pass protection. Nichols has below average top end speed, but should be able to find his role at the next level. (Josh Edwards)\\n\\n236. Colts: Jake Witt, OL, Northern Michigan\\n\\nGrade: C\\n\\nAthletic tackle with a basketball background. Witt needs to do a better job of sinking his hips to absorb contact and overall play strength needs to improve. However, this is a lineman who can move in space and offers developmental upside. (Josh Edwards)\\n\\n237. Seahawks: Kenny McIntosh, RB, Georgia\\n\\nGrade: C-\\n\\nFun versatile RB at Georgia but has lacking long speed and overall athleticism.\\n\\n238. Dolphins: Ryan Hayes, OT, Michigan\\n\\nGrade: C+\\n\\nClassic Michigan blocker. Handles his assignments well, passes off stunts with ease. Decent power. Not a big-time athlete. Short arms. Has to add weight, too.\\n\\n239. Chargers: Max Duggan, QB, TCU\\n\\nGrade: C+\\n\\nBig-time leader at TCU. Really improved his overall game in final season. Small framed. Flustered by pressure. Arm is average. Will take off with his legs and take hits to get the first down.\\n\\n240. Jaguars: Derek Parish, DL, Houston\\n\\nGrade: C+\\n\\nPat Ricard 2.0. Or has that ability because played well on both sides of the ball in college. Advanced rusher who lacks strength but is decently explosive and high-energy.\\n\\n241. Steelers: Cory Trice, CB, Purdue\\n\\nGrade: A+\\n\\nTall, lengthy outside CB with a savvy and athletic game. Sticks to WRs and even when he doesn't his length gets him to the football often. Tested well for his massive frame. Tremendous tackler. Super steal.\\n\\n242. Packers: Anthony Johnson Jr., S, Iowa State\\n\\nGrade: A-\\n\\nTwitchy, rangy slot defender/safety hybrid who plays with reckless abandon. Wants to come up and hit you or erupt a blocker upon contact. Assertive style leads to missed tackles often. Would've liked to see more ball production but has the speed to stay with receivers.\\n\\n243. Giants: Jordon Riley, DL, Oregon\\n\\nGrade: B\\n\\nTall, wide-bodied classic NT. Devours blockers inside but not much of an upfield rusher. This is when you pick a DT like this.\\n\\n244. Cowboys: Jalen Brooks, WR, South Carolina\\n\\nGrade: C-\\n\\nBrooks is a big, physical boundary receiver who lacks top end speed. He does a good job of flattening his routes across the field, but lacks burst. Dallas adds more size to the room. (Josh Edwards)\\n\\n245. Patriots: Isaiah Bolden, CB Jackson State\\n\\nGrade: C+\\n\\nJackson State had a lot of talent at cornerback, which forced Bolden to play out of the slot quite a bit. He has great length and speed to transition to a more traditional boundary role for a player with his traits. (Josh Edwards)\\n\\n246. Bengals: DJ Ivey, CB, Miami\\n\\nGrade: C-\\n\\nSize and length specimen who wore many hats in the Miami defense. Not smooth changing directions. Ran decently well.\\n\\n247. 49ers: Brayden Willis, TE, Oklahoma\\n\\nGrade: A-\\n\\nVery 49ers pick. Willis was barely utilized in the receiving game, but had YAC flashes. Plus athleticism. Smooth in and out of his breaks. H-back type.\\n\\n248. Texans: Brandon Hill, S, Pittsburgh\\n\\nGrade: C+\\n\\nHigher floor safety without a true trump card. Hitter more than a fluid, sink-in-coverage type.\\n\\n249. Eagles: Moro Ojomo, DT, Texas\\n\\nGrade: A\\n\\nDraft crush of mine. One of the purest, up-the-field rushers on the interior in this class. Slippery, effective pass-rush moves and plays with decent power. Love the fit.\\n\\n250. Chiefs: Nic Jones, CB, Ball State\\n\\nGrade: C-\\n\\nAggressive boundary cornerback who is willing to play downhill. He tends to get stuck at the stem and needs to do a better job of breaking his feet down in space. Kansas City has done a great job identifying late-round DBs. (Josh Edwards)\\n\\n251. Steelers: Spencer Anderson, OT, Maryland\\n\\nGrade: B+\\n\\nConfident glider at OG who needs to add weight at the NFL level but plays with great, low center of gravity. Quality athlete, too.\\n\\n252. Bills: Alex Austin, CB, Oregon State\\n\\nGrade: C\\n\\nGood size at CB, but not lengthy. Tackling issues appear often on film. Not a burner down the field or high-caliber athlete overall. Found the football often on the perimeter. Natural in that regard.\\n\\n253. 49ers: Ronnie Bell, WR, Michigan\\n\\nGrade: A-\\n\\nBlast of a YAC specialist. Injury did sap some of his athletic juice but recovered well and was a productive wideout in 2022. Still a fine athlete. Strong hands and glances off second and third-level defenders. Plus hands. Love this pick.\\n\\n254. Giants: Gervarrius Owens, S, Houston\\n\\nGrade: A\\n\\nElectric, highly aware safety. Not a burner, but quickness and range is fantastic. Strong tackler. Pure free safety with range. Love this selection.\\n\\n255. 49ers: Jalen Graham, LB, Purdue\\n\\nGrade: B+\\n\\nSmaller but athletic, rangy off-ball linebacker. Gets engulfed and moved out of the way at times but can stick with TEs and RBs out of the backfield. That's vital.\\n\\n256. Packers: Grant DuBose, WR, Charlotte\\n\\nGrade: A-\\n\\nBig-time sleeper at WR. Tall, well-built frame. Flexible and sudden. Ball-skills master. Above-average run-after-the-catch talent. Plays with nasty demeanor. Loaded young WR group in Green Bay.\\n\\n257. Broncos: Alex Forsyth, IOL, Oregon\\n\\nGrade: B\\n\\nPower scheme center. Not a mobility specialist, but plays with awesome leverage and power. Labored climbs to the second level but will win with strength right away.\\n\\n258. Bears: Kendall Williamson, S, Stanford\\n\\nGrade: C\\n\\nSafety who could reduce down to the LB spot. He excels as a run defender, but it isn't an explosive, oily-hipped coverage player.\\n\\n259. Rams: Desjuan Johnson, DT, Toledo\\n\\nGrade: A-\\n\\nFirst-step quickness is borderline elite. Shoots gaps awesomely. Good pass-rush moves too. Short arms and not much power. Niche role that's valuable in today's NFL.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Aaron Judge appears shaken up after a strikeout in the second inning and is taken out of the game in the fourth with right hip discomfort. (0:27)\\n\\nNew York Yankees captain Aaron Judge has a mild hip strain that manager Aaron Boone said the team will continue to evaluate through the weekend before determining whether the reigning AL MVP will go on the injured list.\\n\\n\"In the grand scheme of things and big picture, we do feel like we got good news on it,\" Boone said before Saturday's 2-0 loss to the Texas Rangers. \"That said, we want to make sure we're doing right by him and by us.\"\\n\\nJudge hasn't played since coming out of the series opener Thursday night, when he was replaced in right field in the bottom of the fourth inning after striking out in his only two at-bats. That came a day after he landed awkwardly on his right side when trying to steal third base at Minnesota on his 31st birthday.\\n\\nBoone said Judge had shown \"a lot of improvement\" while being treated the past two days. He said the slugger wanted to hit Saturday, but that the team was holding him back from baseball activities.\\n\\n\"We're going to wait to see today and tomorrow and see how we're doing, to see if this is something we want to take a 10-day [IL stint], or if he is ready to play by Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday,\" Boone said. \"It will be something that we just kind of pay attention here.\"\\n\\nLater Saturday, Nathan Eovaldi pitched a three-hitter for his first big league nine-inning shutout, Ezequiel Duran hit a two-run homer in the fifth inning and the Rangers blanked the Yankees, New York's fifth loss in seven games.\\n\\nJudge, who hit a single-season AL-record 62 home runs last season, is hitting .261 with six homers and 14 RBIs in 26 games this year. He had played in every Yankees game until being out of the lineup Friday and Saturday.\\n\\nThe Yankees added Jake Bauers to their taxi squad from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre on Friday. He was added to the 26-man roster Saturday, taking the spot of right fielder Franchy Cordero, who was optioned to Triple-A after Friday night's game.\\n\\nNew York already was playing without outfielders Giancarlo Stanton (left hamstring strain) and Harrison Bader (left oblique strain), and third baseman Josh Donaldson (right hamstring strain). All are on the IL, along with six pitchers.\\n\\nWithout Judge, Anthony Rizzo takes over as the leading home run hitter in the lineup with five.\\n\\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.</td>\n",

Russian forces occupied the peninsula in 2014.\\n\\nMoscow has accused Kyiv of sending waves of aerial and seaborne drones to attack Crimea.\\n\\nSevastopol governor Mikhail Razvozhaev said only one drone hit the oil tanks.\\n\\n\"The enemy ... wanted to take Sevastopol by surprise, as usual, by staging a sneak attack in the morning,\" Razvozhaev wrote on the Telegram app. Russian firefighters had shown how to defeat a major blaze \"and prevent a catastrophe\", he added.\\n\\n[1/10] Smoke rises over a fuel tank following an alleged drone attack in Sevastopol, Crimea, April 29, 2023.

Instead, he told RBC the blast was \"God's punishment\" for a Russian strike on the Ukrainian city of Uman on Friday that killed 23 people.\\n\\n\"This punishment will be long-lasting. In the near future, it is better for all residents of temporarily occupied Crimea not to be near military facilities and facilities that provide for the aggressor's army,\" RBC quoted Yusov as saying.\\n\\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Kyiv would do all it could to ensure that those responsible for the attack on Uman be held accountable as soon as possible.\\n\\n\"You are all terrorists and murderers and you must all be punished,\" he said in an evening video address.\\n\\nZelenskiy did not refer directly to the months-long fighting for the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, focus of repeated Russian assaults that have slowly closed in on the centre.\\n\\nThe attacks are largely led by the Wagner private army. Its founder, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said his forces had advanced between 100 (300 feet) and 150 metres on Saturday and claimed pro-Kyiv units now only controlled three sq km (1.2 sq miles).\\n\\nPrigozhin, speaking in a voice message posted to Telegram, repeated his complaints that Moscow was not sending his men enough ammunition. Prigozhin has made over-optimistic statements about Wagner's military successes in the past and Reuters was not able to immediately verify his latest claim.\\n\\nReporting by Reuters; Editing by William Mallard\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

Doing so would add a new highly effective treatment option for obesity.\\n\\nTirzepatide, the active ingredient in the diabetes medication Mounjaro, can help patients lose almost 16% of their body weight, according to trial data shared by pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly.\\n\\nThe weight loss seen in this study was greater than that seen from other medications for obesity and type 2 diabetes, according to Lilly. The company said it will ask the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to grant an indication for weight management—something the drug is not currently approved for, despite its off-label use.\\n\\n“It’s great that we have another medication that helps people to lose weight as well as improving glycemic control. If [tirzepatide] is approved for the management of obesity, I think that’s a welcome addition for us as obesity experts to prescribe,” David Lau, MD, PhD, adjunct professor in the departments of medicine, biochemistry and molecular biology, and kinesiology at the University of Calgary, told Verywell.\\n\\nWegovy (semaglutide) is currently the most effective drug indicated for weight loss in the United States. Approving tirzepatide for weight loss would add another strong obesity treatment option, both for people with and without diabetes, said Dan Bessesen, MD, an endocrinologist and a professor of medicine at the University of Colorado.\\n\\n“I think it is terrific for the field and for patients to have a second medication available. Over time, my sense is the medications available for treating obesity are becoming more effective and will become more widely-used,” Bessesen told Verywell in an email.\\n\\nIf tirzepatide is approved for weight loss, it will likely get a new brand name and dosage to differentiate it from Mounjaro, which is the same drug but only labeled for diabetes treatment. Wegovy and diabetes drug Ozempic provide a similar example; both contain semaglutide, but in different concentrations—so only Wegovy is technically approved for weight management in people without diabetes. When Ozempic is used this way, it’s considered off-label.\\n\\nLilly said it will present its full study results at a conference in late June and will apply for FDA approval of a weight loss indication. The company said it expects an FDA decision in late 2023.\\n\\nMounjaro Works Well in People With Diabetes\\n\\nThe new study included 938 adults who were overweight or living with obesity as well as type 2 diabetes. People taking 10 milligrams (mg) of Mounjaro saw an average of 12.8% body weight reduction while those taking 15 mg lost up to 15.7% of their weight.\\n\\nIt is well established that people with type 2 diabetes tend to have a harder time losing weight than those without diabetes, said Angela Fitch, MD, FACP, FOMA, president of the Obesity Medicine Association.\\n\\n“When we look at patients with type two diabetes and obesity, the people with diabetes consistently lose less weight than the people with just obesity alone,” Fitch told Verywell. “What is being shown here is that Mounjaro is better for weight loss, even in people with diabetes.”\\n\\nIn an earlier phase 3 trial this year, Lilly showed that people with obesity or who are overweight without diabetes lost up to 22.5% of their body weight while taking tirzepatide.\\n\\nHow Mounjaro Stacks Up Against Wegovy\\n\\nWegovy works by mimicking the hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which boosts insulin production. This lowers blood sugar and makes people feel full for longer.\\n\\nMounjaro also increases GLP-1 as well as the hormone glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). Acting on both GIP and GLP-1 can boost metabolism and decrease appetite, causing even greater weight loss and management of blood sugar than GLP-1 agonists alone.\\n\\n“[The data] are certainly very impressive because not only do you see a slightly greater percent body weight loss with tirzepatide, but you also see better glycemic control,” Lau said. “Most of us in the field feel that this is an unexpected finding in the sense that it has a more profound effect.”\\n\\nWegovy, which is FDA-approved for weight management, causes an average of 12.4% weight loss in people without diabetes and 6.2% in those with type 2 diabetes.\\n\\nIt’s challenging to know exactly how Wegovy and Mounjaro stack up as there have been no completed trials directly comparing the two drugs.\\n\\n“The study design is slightly different from clinical trial to clinical trial. So you can’t really compare the efficacy unless you do a head-to-head comparison,” Lau, who is a principal investigator for the STEP 10 semaglutide trials, said.\\n\\nLilly only just began a 700-person study, called SURMOUNT-5, to test tirzepatide against semaglutide directly.\\n\\nWegovy and Ozempic manufacturer Novo Nordisk is years ahead of Eli Lilly in terms of testing its drug for outcomes beyond weight loss. The company is now testing how semaglutide effects overall cardiovascular health, and the data is expected to be shared this year.\\n\\n“If it’s shown that Wegovy has a cardiovascular benefit, it would trump [Mounjaro] anytime when it comes to prescription because now you have a drug that has been shown to have safety data and, if anything, cardiovascular benefits,” Lau said.\\n\\nWhile Mounjaro appears to be better for weight management, Lau said providers will look to prescribe a drug that has proven health benefits beyond shedding pounds. For patients with heart disease, for instance, it will be helpful to have data showing that Wegovy can support heart health while reducing body weight.\\n\\n“The data from the SURMOUNT-1 trial is very encouraging. It looks great,” Lau said. “But my recommendation is let’s wait and see. Let’s not jump the gun and say tirzepatide will torpedo semaglutide because it showed better weight loss data.”\\n\\nA New Drug on the Market Could Improve Obesity Care\\n\\nUltimately, having more obesity treatment options in the toolbox will help clinicians to tailor their treatment for each individual patient, Fitch said.\\n\\n“It’s nice to have multiple options so that we can balance the outcomes with the side effects,” she said.\\n\\nFor months, patients have been scrambling to get their hands on weight loss medications, which have become increasingly popular even among people without obesity. As with Wegovy and Ozempic, Mounjaro is an injectable medication that cannot be mass-produced as easily as an oral medication, so it’s not clear how the new indication would help the drug supply problem, Lau said.\\n\\nIt’s also too soon to know how expensive and accessible Mounjaro will be as a weight loss medication. Some insurance plans may cover obesity medications. But most insurers, including Medicare don’t. Medicare Part D has excluded anti-obesity medications from coverage for two decades, despite general recognition of obesity as a disease.\\n\\nIf tirzepatide is FDA-approved for weight management, it will be up to insurance companies to decide whether they will cover the medication.\\n\\n“Having another large and successful pharmaceutical company involved in this therapeutic area will be helpful for patients,” Bessesen said. “Over time, it will help people see obesity as the chronic metabolic disease that it is.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- New big rigs and buses that run on diesel would not be sold in California starting in 2036, according to new rules approved by state regulators Friday to wean the state off fossil fuels and combat climate change.\\n\\nThe rule would tackle pollution from heavy trucks used to transport goods through ports and require companies to disclose their use of these so-called drayage trucks by 2024.\\n\\nThe rule cannot be implemented without approval by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. But it's related to standards the Biden administration already approved last month to phase out diesel-powered box trucks, semitrailers and large passenger pick-ups. If the EPA approves California's rule, other states could later adopt the same standards.\\n\\nDemocratic Gov. Gavin Newsom touted Friday's move as a chance to show \"the world what real climate action looks like.\"\\n\\n\"We're one step closer to achieving healthier neighborhoods and cleaner air for all Californians,\" he said in a statement.\\n\\nThe state continues to approve ambitious emissions standards as part of its broader goal of achieving carbon neutrality, meaning it would remove as many carbon emissions as it releases, by 2045. Air regulators previously voted to require that all new cars, pickup trucks and SUVs be electric or hydrogen by 2035. And they have banned the sale of new products run by small gas-powered engines, including leaf blowers, lawn mowers and portable generators.\\n\\nThe truck emissions vote follows the California Air Resources Board's approval Thursday of a rule phasing out decades-old diesel locomotives and a transition to more zero-emission technology to power trains that transport food, lumber, oil and other products.\\n\\nBut some in the trucking industry are concerned the rule will ultimately increase prices for goods that are trucked.\\n\\nThe American Trucking Associations called the rule \"unrealistic.\" The group is worried about how expensive a drastic shift to zero-emission vehicles will be and says vehicle-charging infrastructure is not equipped for the transition.\\n\\n\"As it becomes clear that California's rhetoric is not being matched by technology, we hope the Board will reverse course and allow trucking companies the freedom to choose the clean technologies that work best for their operations,\" the group said in a statement.\\n\\nEmissions from trucks have already gone down drastically in recent decades, it said.\\n\\nMore than 100 models of zero-emission trucks are available in North America, state regulators say. On top of that, more than 100 others are being produced.\\n\\nFriday's rule, combined with previous electric truck regulations approved by the state, would mean more than 1.6 million zero-emission medium- and heavy-duty trucks would operate in the state by 2048.\\n\\nNationwide, the transportation sector contributes the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions annually, according to the EPA, with medium- and heavy-duty trucks contributing nearly a quarter of those emissions.\\n\\nHeavy-duty vehicles make up about 3% of vehicles on the road in California, but they generate more than half of nitrogen oxides and fine particle diesel pollution, according to the California Air Resources Board. That's because these trucks have diesel engines that, while more powerful, produce more pollution than gasoline engines. They also travel many more miles than passenger vehicles.\\n\\nCalifornia has lots of these trucks on the road because it has two of the busiest ports in the world at Los Angeles and Long Beach.\\n\\nLong Beach resident Theral Golden said the truck emissions rule is overdue but he wants officials to go further by downsizing the ports.\\n\\n\"We need additional relief,\" Golden said.\\n\\nOf the top 10 most ozone-polluted cities in the U.S., six are in California, according to the American Lung Association's State of the Air report.\\n\\n\"You can't overstate the importance of the actions taken in California today from a public health perspective,\" said Will Barrett, national senior director for clean air advocacy for the American Lung Association.\\n\\nSam Wilson, an analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said in a statement the technology is available to start transitioning toward electric trucks.\\n\\n\"We need this standard to accelerate the necessary phase-out of fossil-fueled trucks that are fouling our air,\" Wilson said.</td>\n",

       "1   Want to know what I think of every pick made in the seventh round of the 2023 NFL Draft plus all the other rounds? I graded all the Round 7 picks below, plus all the other Day 2 and Day 3 selections.\\n\\nIf you want to do all that plus track the best available prospects and get access to every pick in the draft on one page, you can in our draft tracker.\\n\\nGrades: Round 1 • Round 2 • Round 3 • Round 4 • Round 5 • Round 6 • Round 7\\n\\n218. Bears: Travis Bell, DL, Kennesaw State\\n\\nGrade: C\\n\\nClassic small-school undersized three-technique rusher who tested his way into the draft. Needs to get stronger and will take time to learn how to dispatch NFL blockers.\\n\\n219. Lions: Antoine Green, WR, North Carolina\\n\\nGrade: A\\n\\nDraft crush of mine. Tall, decently filled out, explosive YAC specialist on the outside who showcased plus ball-tracking skill as a leaper down the field. Has all the talent and nuance to be a more productive pro than he was in college.\\n\\n220. Jets: Zack Kuntz, TE, Old Dominion\\n\\nGrade: A\\n\\nMost athletic TE in the class and plays to it on the field. Looks like an enormous WR on the field. Not quite as good in contested-catch scenarios as his size would indicate. Can separate at the next level. If he stays healthy, this is a great value pick.\\n\\n221. Colts: Jaylon Jones, CB, Texas A&M\\n\\nGrade: B-\\n\\nSavvy zone cornerback. Dynamic movements. Plants and drives on the football underneath. OK tackler.\\n\\n222. Vikings: DeWayne McBride, RB, UAB\\n\\nGrade: A\\n\\nCould be one of the biggest steals in the class. Feature-back size and has the complete skill set to be very elusive at the next level. Not crazy fast but has juice. Compact balance is awesome. Plus value pick.\\n\\n223. Rams: Ethan Evans, P, Wingate\\n\\nGrade: C\\n\\nBest small-school punter in the class. Big frame with monster leg. Directional kicks need work.\\n\\n224. Falcons: DeMarcco Hellams, S, Alabama\\n\\nGrade: B-\\n\\nHellams is an experienced defensive back coming out of a Nick Saban-coached secondary. He has good awareness and understands route patterns, but lacks ideal top end and recovery speed. Maxed out athleticism with a solid floor. (Josh Edwards)\\n\\n225. Falcons: Jovaughn Gwyn, IOL, South Carolina\\n\\nGrade: B+\\n\\nOverachieving interior blocker with size and length deficiencies. Wall-off blocker who battles hard. Low center of gravity helps his power. Good IOL depth for Falcons.\\n\\n226. Jaguars: Cooper Hodges, OL, Appalachian State\\n\\nGrade: D+\\n\\nBattler at OT who'll probably move inside to guard at the next level. Quality but unspectacular athleticism. Needs to get stronger to move people backward at the next level. Best getting lateral. Lunges pop in pass pro\\n\\n227. Jaguars: Raymond Vohasek, DL, North Carolina\\n\\nGrade: C-\\n\\nInterior DL with NFL size and close to NFL power. Flexibility and burst are lower-level. Not overly athletic. Powerful levers he uses well.\\n\\n228. Titans: Colton Dowell, WR, Tennessee-Martin\\n\\nGrade: C-\\n\\nClassic outside WR size and was big-time tested. Productive at small-school level. Will have to acclimate to the speed, quickness and strength of NFL CBs. Big leap for him in those regards.\\n\\n229. Ravens: Andrew Vorhees, IOL, USC\\n\\nGrade: C+\\n\\nProbably would've been an early Day 3 pick had he not tore a knee ligament during the pre-draft process. Super-experienced guard with good power. Balance and accuracy at second level is a little underwhelming. Very Ravens selection. Redshirt season in 2023.\\n\\n230. Bills: Nick Broeker, OT, Ole Miss\\n\\nGrade: B\\n\\nKing of winning ugly up front. Played OT and OG at Ole Miss. Good power to his game and will work tirelessly to recover. Anchor is quality. Short-area quickness is impressive.\\n\\n231. Raiders: Nesta Jade Silvera, DL, Arizona State\\n\\nGrade: B+\\n\\nFun, undersized up-the-field rusher. Slippery type. Not a great athlete and lacks length. Gets washed out against the run often.\\n\\n232. Packers: Carrington Valentine, CB, Kentucky\\n\\nGrade: A-\\n\\nTall, nasty, athletic cornerback who wants to get under the WR's skin. Incredibly physical at the line. Has recovery speed if beaten. Didn't have much ball production and his wild style leads to missed tackles. High-upside flier.\\n\\n233. Commanders: Andre Jones, EDGE, Louisiana\\n\\nGrade: C\\n\\nVersatile LB who plays a physical style. But his power his inconsistent. Old-school downhill type who works well in the box but lacks in coverage.\\n\\n234. Rams: Jason Taylor II, S, Oklahoma State\\n\\nGrade: B+\\n\\nElite tester who's not quite as explosive and speedy on film. Plenty of experience as slot defender and from a deep middle safety. Ball skills are there. Occasionally reacts to routes a tick late. Tackling is average.\\n\\n235. Packers: Lew Nichols III, RB, Central Michigan\\n\\nGrade: C\\n\\nNichols has the size of an NFL feature back and is willing to fight through contact. He has good pass-catching ability but there is room for improvement in pass protection. Nichols has below average top end speed, but should be able to find his role at the next level. (Josh Edwards)\\n\\n236. Colts: Jake Witt, OL, Northern Michigan\\n\\nGrade: C\\n\\nAthletic tackle with a basketball background. Witt needs to do a better job of sinking his hips to absorb contact and overall play strength needs to improve. However, this is a lineman who can move in space and offers developmental upside. (Josh Edwards)\\n\\n237. Seahawks: Kenny McIntosh, RB, Georgia\\n\\nGrade: C-\\n\\nFun versatile RB at Georgia but has lacking long speed and overall athleticism.\\n\\n238. Dolphins: Ryan Hayes, OT, Michigan\\n\\nGrade: C+\\n\\nClassic Michigan blocker. Handles his assignments well, passes off stunts with ease. Decent power. Not a big-time athlete. Short arms. Has to add weight, too.\\n\\n239. Chargers: Max Duggan, QB, TCU\\n\\nGrade: C+\\n\\nBig-time leader at TCU. Really improved his overall game in final season. Small framed. Flustered by pressure. Arm is average. Will take off with his legs and take hits to get the first down.\\n\\n240. Jaguars: Derek Parish, DL, Houston\\n\\nGrade: C+\\n\\nPat Ricard 2.0. Or has that ability because played well on both sides of the ball in college. Advanced rusher who lacks strength but is decently explosive and high-energy.\\n\\n241. Steelers: Cory Trice, CB, Purdue\\n\\nGrade: A+\\n\\nTall, lengthy outside CB with a savvy and athletic game. Sticks to WRs and even when he doesn't his length gets him to the football often. Tested well for his massive frame. Tremendous tackler. Super steal.\\n\\n242. Packers: Anthony Johnson Jr., S, Iowa State\\n\\nGrade: A-\\n\\nTwitchy, rangy slot defender/safety hybrid who plays with reckless abandon. Wants to come up and hit you or erupt a blocker upon contact. Assertive style leads to missed tackles often. Would've liked to see more ball production but has the speed to stay with receivers.\\n\\n243. Giants: Jordon Riley, DL, Oregon\\n\\nGrade: B\\n\\nTall, wide-bodied classic NT. Devours blockers inside but not much of an upfield rusher. This is when you pick a DT like this.\\n\\n244. Cowboys: Jalen Brooks, WR, South Carolina\\n\\nGrade: C-\\n\\nBrooks is a big, physical boundary receiver who lacks top end speed. He does a good job of flattening his routes across the field, but lacks burst. Dallas adds more size to the room. (Josh Edwards)\\n\\n245. Patriots: Isaiah Bolden, CB Jackson State\\n\\nGrade: C+\\n\\nJackson State had a lot of talent at cornerback, which forced Bolden to play out of the slot quite a bit. He has great length and speed to transition to a more traditional boundary role for a player with his traits. (Josh Edwards)\\n\\n246. Bengals: DJ Ivey, CB, Miami\\n\\nGrade: C-\\n\\nSize and length specimen who wore many hats in the Miami defense. Not smooth changing directions. Ran decently well.\\n\\n247. 49ers: Brayden Willis, TE, Oklahoma\\n\\nGrade: A-\\n\\nVery 49ers pick. Willis was barely utilized in the receiving game, but had YAC flashes. Plus athleticism. Smooth in and out of his breaks. H-back type.\\n\\n248. Texans: Brandon Hill, S, Pittsburgh\\n\\nGrade: C+\\n\\nHigher floor safety without a true trump card. Hitter more than a fluid, sink-in-coverage type.\\n\\n249. Eagles: Moro Ojomo, DT, Texas\\n\\nGrade: A\\n\\nDraft crush of mine. One of the purest, up-the-field rushers on the interior in this class. Slippery, effective pass-rush moves and plays with decent power. Love the fit.\\n\\n250. Chiefs: Nic Jones, CB, Ball State\\n\\nGrade: C-\\n\\nAggressive boundary cornerback who is willing to play downhill. He tends to get stuck at the stem and needs to do a better job of breaking his feet down in space. Kansas City has done a great job identifying late-round DBs. (Josh Edwards)\\n\\n251. Steelers: Spencer Anderson, OT, Maryland\\n\\nGrade: B+\\n\\nConfident glider at OG who needs to add weight at the NFL level but plays with great, low center of gravity. Quality athlete, too.\\n\\n252. Bills: Alex Austin, CB, Oregon State\\n\\nGrade: C\\n\\nGood size at CB, but not lengthy. Tackling issues appear often on film. Not a burner down the field or high-caliber athlete overall. Found the football often on the perimeter. Natural in that regard.\\n\\n253. 49ers: Ronnie Bell, WR, Michigan\\n\\nGrade: A-\\n\\nBlast of a YAC specialist. Injury did sap some of his athletic juice but recovered well and was a productive wideout in 2022. Still a fine athlete. Strong hands and glances off second and third-level defenders. Plus hands. Love this pick.\\n\\n254. Giants: Gervarrius Owens, S, Houston\\n\\nGrade: A\\n\\nElectric, highly aware safety. Not a burner, but quickness and range is fantastic. Strong tackler. Pure free safety with range. Love this selection.\\n\\n255. 49ers: Jalen Graham, LB, Purdue\\n\\nGrade: B+\\n\\nSmaller but athletic, rangy off-ball linebacker. Gets engulfed and moved out of the way at times but can stick with TEs and RBs out of the backfield. That's vital.\\n\\n256. Packers: Grant DuBose, WR, Charlotte\\n\\nGrade: A-\\n\\nBig-time sleeper at WR. Tall, well-built frame. Flexible and sudden. Ball-skills master. Above-average run-after-the-catch talent. Plays with nasty demeanor. Loaded young WR group in Green Bay.\\n\\n257. Broncos: Alex Forsyth, IOL, Oregon\\n\\nGrade: B\\n\\nPower scheme center. Not a mobility specialist, but plays with awesome leverage and power. Labored climbs to the second level but will win with strength right away.\\n\\n258. Bears: Kendall Williamson, S, Stanford\\n\\nGrade: C\\n\\nSafety who could reduce down to the LB spot. He excels as a run defender, but it isn't an explosive, oily-hipped coverage player.\\n\\n259. Rams: Desjuan Johnson, DT, Toledo\\n\\nGrade: A-\\n\\nFirst-step quickness is borderline elite. Shoots gaps awesomely. Good pass-rush moves too. Short arms and not much power. Niche role that's valuable in today's NFL.  \n",

after a strikeout in the second inning and is taken out of the game in the fourth with right hip discomfort. (0:27)\\n\\nNew York Yankees captain Aaron Judge has a mild hip strain that manager Aaron Boone said the team will continue to evaluate through the weekend before determining whether the reigning AL MVP will go on the injured list.\\n\\n\"In the grand scheme of things and big picture, we do feel like we got good news on it,\" Boone said before Saturday's 2-0 loss to the Texas Rangers. \"That said, we want to make sure we're doing right by him and by us.\"\\n\\nJudge hasn't played since coming out of the series opener Thursday night, when he was replaced in right field in the bottom of the fourth inning after striking out in his only two at-bats. That came a day after he landed awkwardly on his right side when trying to steal third base at Minnesota on his 31st birthday.\\n\\nBoone said Judge had shown \"a lot of improvement\" while being treated the past two days. He said the slugger wanted to hit Saturday, but that the team was holding him back from baseball activities.\\n\\n\"We're going to wait to see today and tomorrow and see how we're doing, to see if this is something we want to take a 10-day [IL stint], or if he is ready to play by Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday,\" Boone said. \"It will be something that we just kind of pay attention here.\"\\n\\nLater Saturday, Nathan Eovaldi pitched a three-hitter for his first big league nine-inning shutout, Ezequiel Duran hit a two-run homer in the fifth inning and the Rangers blanked the Yankees, New York's fifth loss in seven games.\\n\\nJudge, who hit a single-season AL-record 62 home runs last season, is hitting .261 with six homers and 14 RBIs in 26 games this year. He had played in every Yankees game until being out of the lineup Friday and Saturday.\\n\\nThe Yankees added Jake Bauers to their taxi squad from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre on Friday. He was added to the 26-man roster Saturday, taking the spot of right fielder Franchy Cordero, who was optioned to Triple-A after Friday night's game.\\n\\nNew York already was playing without outfielders Giancarlo Stanton (left hamstring strain) and Harrison Bader (left oblique strain), and third baseman Josh Donaldson (right hamstring strain). All are on the IL, along with six pitchers.\\n\\nWithout Judge, Anthony Rizzo takes over as the leading home run hitter in the lineup with five.\\n\\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.  \n",

NFL draft, No. 219 overall, the second selection of the seventh round.\\n\\nGreen, 6 feet 2 and 199 pounds, caught 43 passes for 798 yards last season, in his second year as a fulltime starter.\\n\\nHe ran a 4.47-second 40-yard dash at the combine and adds a vertical threat to a Lions offense that will be without Jameson Williams for the first six games of the 2023 season due to a suspension for violating the NFL's gambling policy.\\n\\nREAD MORE:Jameson Williams' minor transgression may be bigger cause for concern\\n\\nGRADING THE PICK:What we think of Lions grabbing deep threat WR Antoine Green\\n\\nLions general manager Brad Holmes said this week he was on heightened alert to add playmakers on offense because of a suspension that left the team shorthanded in the passing game. Wide receiver Stanley Berryhill also was suspended six games, and the Lions released Quintez Cephus after he was suspended indefinitely for betting on football.\\n\\n\"You obviously think about it,\" Holmes said late Friday night. \"When you lose multiple players at one position, it’s pretty obvious that you’ve got to kind of be rational and be sound and look at all your options.\"\\n\\nGRADING THE PICK:Why William & Mary OL Colby Sorsdal doesn't move the needle\\n\\nJEFF SEIDEL:Matthew Stafford trade finally complete, putting Lions in incredible position\\n\\nThe Lions added two offensive skill players in the draft's first six rounds, taking dual-threat running back Jahmyr Gibbs at No. 12 overall and tight end Sam LaPorta at No. 34.\\n\\nAfter a busy Friday in which they made two trades up and two trades back, the Lions opened Saturday by dealing running back D'Andre Swift to the Philadelphia Eagles for a 2025 fourth-round pick and a swap of seventh-round choices, then took William and Mary offensive lineman Colby Sorsdal at Pick No. 152 in the fifth round.\\n\\nThe Lions used the seventh-round pick they acquired from the Eagles to draft Green.\\n\\nDAVE BIRKETT:Hendon Hooker is part insurance policy, part lottery ticket for Lions\\n\\nANALYSIS:Brad Holmes deserves benefit of doubt, but Lions' ignorance of analytics could backfire\\n\\nThe Lions have made eight selections in this draft.\\n\\nContact Dave Birkett at dbirkett@freepress.com.

Sevastopol early on Saturday, sending a vast column of black smoke into the sky in the latest attack on the Russia-occupied peninsula.\\n\\nThe city's Moscow-installed governor blamed Ukraine and later said the fire had been put out before a disaster occurred.\\n\\nA Ukrainian military intelligence official said more than 10 tanks of oil products with a capacity of about 40,000 tonnes intended for use by Russia's Black Sea Fleet were destroyed, RBC Ukraine reported.\\n\\nThe strike came as Ukraine prepares for a long-promised counter offensive to push Russian forces back from territory they seized since invading in February 2022.\\n\\nUkraine says control of all its legal territory, including Crimea, is a key condition for any peace deal. Russian forces occupied the peninsula in 2014.\\n\\nMoscow has accused Kyiv of sending waves of aerial and seaborne drones to attack Crimea.\\n\\nSevastopol governor Mikhail Razvozhaev said only one drone hit the oil tanks.\\n\\n\"The enemy ... wanted to take Sevastopol by surprise, as usual, by staging a sneak attack in the morning,\" Razvozhaev wrote on the Telegram app. Russian firefighters had shown how to defeat a major blaze \"and prevent a catastrophe\", he added.\\n\\n[1/10] Smoke rises over a fuel tank following an alleged drone attack in Sevastopol, Crimea, April 29, 2023. REUTERS/Stringer 1 2 3 4 5\\n\\nUkraine lacks longer-range missiles that can reach targets in places such as Sevastopol, but has been developing drones to overcome this hurdle.\\n\\nUkrainian officials do not usually claim responsibility for explosions at military sites in Crimea, although they sometimes celebrate them using euphemistic language.\\n\\nAndriy Yusov, a Ukrainian military official, did not say Ukraine carried out the attack. Instead, he told RBC the blast was \"God's punishment\" for a Russian strike on the Ukrainian city of Uman on Friday that killed 23 people.\\n\\n\"This punishment will be long-lasting. In the near future, it is better for all residents of temporarily occupied Crimea not to be near military facilities and facilities that provide for the aggressor's army,\" RBC quoted Yusov as saying.\\n\\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Kyiv would do all it could to ensure that those responsible for the attack on Uman be held accountable as soon as possible.\\n\\n\"You are all terrorists and murderers and you must all be punished,\" he said in an evening video address.\\n\\nZelenskiy did not refer directly to the months-long fighting for the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, focus of repeated Russian assaults that have slowly closed in on the centre.\\n\\nThe attacks are largely led by the Wagner private army. Its founder, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said his forces had advanced between 100 (300 feet) and 150 metres on Saturday and claimed pro-Kyiv units now only controlled three sq km (1.2 sq miles).\\n\\nPrigozhin, speaking in a voice message posted to Telegram, repeated his complaints that Moscow was not sending his men enough ammunition. Prigozhin has made over-optimistic statements about Wagner's military successes in the past and Reuters was not able to immediately verify his latest claim.\\n\\nReporting by Reuters; Editing by William Mallard\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.  \n",

Doing so would add a new highly effective treatment option for obesity.\\n\\nTirzepatide, the active ingredient in the diabetes medication Mounjaro, can help patients lose almost 16% of their body weight, according to trial data shared by pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly.\\n\\nThe weight loss seen in this study was greater than that seen from other medications for obesity and type 2 diabetes, according to Lilly. The company said it will ask the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to grant an indication for weight management—something the drug is not currently approved for, despite its off-label use.\\n\\n“It’s great that we have another medication that helps people to lose weight as well as improving glycemic control. If [tirzepatide] is approved for the management of obesity, I think that’s a welcome addition for us as obesity experts to prescribe,” David Lau, MD, PhD, adjunct professor in the departments of medicine, biochemistry and molecular biology, and kinesiology at the University of Calgary, told Verywell.\\n\\nWegovy (semaglutide) is currently the most effective drug indicated for weight loss in the United States. Approving tirzepatide for weight loss would add another strong obesity treatment option, both for people with and without diabetes, said Dan Bessesen, MD, an endocrinologist and a professor of medicine at the University of Colorado.\\n\\n“I think it is terrific for the field and for patients to have a second medication available. Over time, my sense is the medications available for treating obesity are becoming more effective and will become more widely-used,” Bessesen told Verywell in an email.\\n\\nIf tirzepatide is approved for weight loss, it will likely get a new brand name and dosage to differentiate it from Mounjaro, which is the same drug but only labeled for diabetes treatment. Wegovy and diabetes drug Ozempic provide a similar example; both contain semaglutide, but in different concentrations—so only Wegovy is technically approved for weight management in people without diabetes. When Ozempic is used this way, it’s considered off-label.\\n\\nLilly said it will present its full study results at a conference in late June and will apply for FDA approval of a weight loss indication. The company said it expects an FDA decision in late 2023.\\n\\nMounjaro Works Well in People With Diabetes\\n\\nThe new study included 938 adults who were overweight or living with obesity as well as type 2 diabetes. People taking 10 milligrams (mg) of Mounjaro saw an average of 12.8% body weight reduction while those taking 15 mg lost up to 15.7% of their weight.\\n\\nIt is well established that people with type 2 diabetes tend to have a harder time losing weight than those without diabetes, said Angela Fitch, MD, FACP, FOMA, president of the Obesity Medicine Association.\\n\\n“When we look at patients with type two diabetes and obesity, the people with diabetes consistently lose less weight than the people with just obesity alone,” Fitch told Verywell. “What is being shown here is that Mounjaro is better for weight loss, even in people with diabetes.”\\n\\nIn an earlier phase 3 trial this year, Lilly showed that people with obesity or who are overweight without diabetes lost up to 22.5% of their body weight while taking tirzepatide.\\n\\nHow Mounjaro Stacks Up Against Wegovy\\n\\nWegovy works by mimicking the hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which boosts insulin production. This lowers blood sugar and makes people feel full for longer.\\n\\nMounjaro also increases GLP-1 as well as the hormone glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). Acting on both GIP and GLP-1 can boost metabolism and decrease appetite, causing even greater weight loss and management of blood sugar than GLP-1 agonists alone.\\n\\n“[The data] are certainly very impressive because not only do you see a slightly greater percent body weight loss with tirzepatide, but you also see better glycemic control,” Lau said. “Most of us in the field feel that this is an unexpected finding in the sense that it has a more profound effect.”\\n\\nWegovy, which is FDA-approved for weight management, causes an average of 12.4% weight loss in people without diabetes and 6.2% in those with type 2 diabetes.\\n\\nIt’s challenging to know exactly how Wegovy and Mounjaro stack up as there have been no completed trials directly comparing the two drugs.\\n\\n“The study design is slightly different from clinical trial to clinical trial. So you can’t really compare the efficacy unless you do a head-to-head comparison,” Lau, who is a principal investigator for the STEP 10 semaglutide trials, said.\\n\\nLilly only just began a 700-person study, called SURMOUNT-5, to test tirzepatide against semaglutide directly.\\n\\nWegovy and Ozempic manufacturer Novo Nordisk is years ahead of Eli Lilly in terms of testing its drug for outcomes beyond weight loss. The company is now testing how semaglutide effects overall cardiovascular health, and the data is expected to be shared this year.\\n\\n“If it’s shown that Wegovy has a cardiovascular benefit, it would trump [Mounjaro] anytime when it comes to prescription because now you have a drug that has been shown to have safety data and, if anything, cardiovascular benefits,” Lau said.\\n\\nWhile Mounjaro appears to be better for weight management, Lau said providers will look to prescribe a drug that has proven health benefits beyond shedding pounds. For patients with heart disease, for instance, it will be helpful to have data showing that Wegovy can support heart health while reducing body weight.\\n\\n“The data from the SURMOUNT-1 trial is very encouraging. It looks great,” Lau said. “But my recommendation is let’s wait and see. Let’s not jump the gun and say tirzepatide will torpedo semaglutide because it showed better weight loss data.”\\n\\nA New Drug on the Market Could Improve Obesity Care\\n\\nUltimately, having more obesity treatment options in the toolbox will help clinicians to tailor their treatment for each individual patient, Fitch said.\\n\\n“It’s nice to have multiple options so that we can balance the outcomes with the side effects,” she said.\\n\\nFor months, patients have been scrambling to get their hands on weight loss medications, which have become increasingly popular even among people without obesity. As with Wegovy and Ozempic, Mounjaro is an injectable medication that cannot be mass-produced as easily as an oral medication, so it’s not clear how the new indication would help the drug supply problem, Lau said.\\n\\nIt’s also too soon to know how expensive and accessible Mounjaro will be as a weight loss medication. Some insurance plans may cover obesity medications. But most insurers, including Medicare don’t. Medicare Part D has excluded anti-obesity medications from coverage for two decades, despite general recognition of obesity as a disease.\\n\\nIf tirzepatide is FDA-approved for weight management, it will be up to insurance companies to decide whether they will cover the medication.\\n\\n“Having another large and successful pharmaceutical company involved in this therapeutic area will be helpful for patients,” Bessesen said. “Over time, it will help people see obesity as the chronic metabolic disease that it is.”  \n",

remotely,\" notes the New York Times , \"logging into videoconferences from their homes and dispersing across the country like many other tech workers. Last year, the company made that policy official, telling staff that work would be 'fully flexible' and subleasing floors of its offices in San Francisco and elsewhere.\"Risher \"said the cost savings from the layoffs would go toward lower prices for riders and higher earnings for drivers,\" the Times adds, noting that last month Lyft's two founders said they'd step down after disappointing financial results. (Lyft's stock price closed Friday at $10.25 — down from a peak of $78.)Bob Sutton, a Stanford professor and organizational psychologist, suggests another possible motivation to the Times: executives worried about financial stress \"feel compelled to increase their own illusion of control.\"  \n",

killing five neighbors in southeast Texas after one of them asked him to stop shooting his rifle late Friday, saying that a baby was trying to sleep.\\n\\nThe suspect in the execution-style killings is Francisco Oropeza, 39, a Mexican national, according to San Jacinto County Sheriff Greg Capers.\\n\\nCapers said during a Saturday afternoon press conference that Oropeza \"could be anywhere now.\" Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Houston Field Office said that Oropeza should be considered \"armed and dangerous\" and is a \"threat to the community.\"\\n\\nThe Texas Department of Corrections has sent a team with dogs, officers on horseback and a drone in the air to assist with Oropeza's arrest, police said.\\n\\nNASHVILLE POLICE DEPARTMENT TO RELEASE COVENANT SCHOOL SHOOTER'S MANIFESTO: WILL IT BE REDACTED?\\n\\nOfficials said the following individuals were killed in the shooting: Sonia Argentina Guzman, 25; Daniel Enrique Laso, 8; Diana Velazquez Alvarado, 21; Julisa Molina Rivera, 31; and Jose Jonathan Casarez, 18.\\n\\nCapers said during the press conference that law enforcement officers located some Oropeza's clothing and tracking dogs picked up the scent, adding that the dogs lost the scent after they reached the water. Officers also located his cell phone.\\n\\nHe added that the search area is now up to 10 or 20 square miles.\\n\\nCapers told Fox News Digital he is \"praying\" that the suspect will be in custody in the next two to four hours.\\n\\nHe said this was the first mass shooting incident with more than three victims his office has ever dealt with.\\n\\n\"Nobody should ever have to witness this,\" Capers said. \"Nobody should ever have to live through this.\"\\n\\nJust before midnight, deputies with the San Jacinto County Sheriff’s Office were dispatched to respond to a call for \"harassment\" at the 100 block of Walters Road in the Trails End area of Cleveland, about 50 miles north of Houston.\\n\\nEn route to the scene, the sheriff's office received multiple 911 calls about an active shooter at the location. Upon arriving, officers discovered five people had been shot at the residence, police said.\\n\\nAccording to the sheriff, the suspect was a neighbor who had been firing an AR-15-style .223 caliber rifle in his yard before midnight. Police found shell casings in the yard.\\n\\nTEXAS MAN WHO WAS FUGITIVE IN MEXICO SENTENCED FOR 2013 MURDER OF BOSS\\n\\n\"One of the victims came out of the house and said, hey, we have a small baby that's trying to sleep,\" Casper told KTRK. \"And the man said, I'll shoot out in my front yard, I do what I want to in my own residence.\"\\n\\nWitnesses told investigators the gunman was drinking alcohol.\\n\\nWhat happened next is shocking. Police say the man walked up to the front door of his neighbor's house and began firing. One victim was found by the doorway leading into the living room. Another victim was found dead in the living room. Two more women were found shot dead upstairs, their bodies shielding young children who survived and were taken to a hospital.\\n\\nCaspers said each victim had been shot in the head.\\n\\nTEXAS MAN ACCUSED OF LEAVING DATE, KILLING PARKING LOT SCAMMER, THEN RETURNING TO RESTAURANT\\n\\nWhen police arrived, four people were pronounced dead at the scene and an eight-year-old boy was airlifted in critical condition to a local trauma center, where he died, Capers said.\\n\\nA SWAT unit from neighboring Montgomery County arrived to assist and cleared several properties near to the crime scene. The shooter was determined to have fled the county.\\n\\nThree other victims were taken to the hospital \"covered in blood,\" according to the sheriff's office. It was not clear if they were injured or if the blood belonged to the other victims.\\n\\nCapers said that the victims were from Honduras. He said a total of 10 people were living in the house. Of those killed, four were adults, one male and three females, while the youngest was just eight years old. The three other victims who were taken to the hospital were children.\\n\\nTEXAS SOCIALITE IN SUSPECTED DRUNKEN-DIRIVING CRASH KILLS MAN ON FIRST DATE: COURT DOCS\\n\\nTwo other people inside the residence were evaluated at the scene and released, police said.\\n\\n\"When we got here, the two females in the bedroom were actually laying over the top of the younger children, two of the three younger children\" that survived, Capers said.\\n\\nThe sheriff's office is withholding the identities of the victims pending notification of next of kin, but says it has a copy of Oropeza's consular identification card.\\n\\nCaspers said authorities confiscated a shotgun, two rifles, including the .223 caliber rifle, and a pistol from the victims' residence.\\n\\nA judge issued a warrant for the suspect's arrest and assigned a $5 million bond.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nTexas Rangers are assisting with the ongoing investigation.

rules approved by state regulators Friday to wean the state off fossil fuels and combat climate change.\\n\\nThe rule would tackle pollution from heavy trucks used to transport goods through ports and require companies to disclose their use of these so-called drayage trucks by 2024.\\n\\nThe rule cannot be implemented without approval by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. But it's related to standards the Biden administration already approved last month to phase out diesel-powered box trucks, semitrailers and large passenger pick-ups. If the EPA approves California's rule, other states could later adopt the same standards.\\n\\nDemocratic Gov. Gavin Newsom touted Friday's move as a chance to show \"the world what real climate action looks like.\"\\n\\n\"We're one step closer to achieving healthier neighborhoods and cleaner air for all Californians,\" he said in a statement.\\n\\nThe state continues to approve ambitious emissions standards as part of its broader goal of achieving carbon neutrality, meaning it would remove as many carbon emissions as it releases, by 2045. Air regulators previously voted to require that all new cars, pickup trucks and SUVs be electric or hydrogen by 2035. And they have banned the sale of new products run by small gas-powered engines, including leaf blowers, lawn mowers and portable generators.\\n\\nThe truck emissions vote follows the California Air Resources Board's approval Thursday of a rule phasing out decades-old diesel locomotives and a transition to more zero-emission technology to power trains that transport food, lumber, oil and other products.\\n\\nBut some in the trucking industry are concerned the rule will ultimately increase prices for goods that are trucked.\\n\\nThe American Trucking Associations called the rule \"unrealistic.\" The group is worried about how expensive a drastic shift to zero-emission vehicles will be and says vehicle-charging infrastructure is not equipped for the transition.\\n\\n\"As it becomes clear that California's rhetoric is not being matched by technology, we hope the Board will reverse course and allow trucking companies the freedom to choose the clean technologies that work best for their operations,\" the group said in a statement.\\n\\nEmissions from trucks have already gone down drastically in recent decades, it said.\\n\\nMore than 100 models of zero-emission trucks are available in North America, state regulators say. On top of that, more than 100 others are being produced.\\n\\nFriday's rule, combined with previous electric truck regulations approved by the state, would mean more than 1.6 million zero-emission medium- and heavy-duty trucks would operate in the state by 2048.\\n\\nNationwide, the transportation sector contributes the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions annually, according to the EPA, with medium- and heavy-duty trucks contributing nearly a quarter of those emissions.\\n\\nHeavy-duty vehicles make up about 3% of vehicles on the road in California, but they generate more than half of nitrogen oxides and fine particle diesel pollution, according to the California Air Resources Board. That's because these trucks have diesel engines that, while more powerful, produce more pollution than gasoline engines. They also travel many more miles than passenger vehicles.\\n\\nCalifornia has lots of these trucks on the road because it has two of the busiest ports in the world at Los Angeles and Long Beach.\\n\\nLong Beach resident Theral Golden said the truck emissions rule is overdue but he wants officials to go further by downsizing the ports.\\n\\n\"We need additional relief,\" Golden said.\\n\\nOf the top 10 most ozone-polluted cities in the U.S., six are in California, according to the American Lung Association's State of the Air report.\\n\\n\"You can't overstate the importance of the actions taken in California today from a public health perspective,\" said Will Barrett, national senior director for clean air advocacy for the American Lung Association.\\n\\nSam Wilson, an analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said in a statement the technology is available to start transitioning toward electric trucks.\\n\\n\"We need this standard to accelerate the necessary phase-out of fossil-fueled trucks that are fouling our air,\" Wilson said.  \n",

over 500 children now faces a fine of around $110,000 if he donates again, a court ruled on Friday.\\n\\nA Dutch court this week heard the case of Jonathan Jacob Meijer, 41, who promised mothers who used his sperm that he would stop donating in order to limit the risk of accidental incest but continued to donate anyway. Eva, the mother who launched the lawsuit, said that Meijer had misled the women.\\n\\n\"In conversations with the donor, many mothers have indicated that he should stop, but nothing helps,\" Eva said when she filed her suit. \"Going to court is the only way to protect my child.\"\\n\\nNow, a judge has ruled that Meijer, originally from The Hague, must immediately stop donating and must call up any clinic where he has donated and request they immediately destroy his samples.\\n\\nMISSISSIPPI MOTHER OF RARE QUINTUPLETS REVEALS FIRST PHOTOS OF HER BABIES AS THEY ‘REACH NEW MILESTONES’\\n\\nThe court ruled that \"the interests of the donor children and their parents outweigh the interest of the donor in continuing to donate sperm to new prospective parents\" and ordered a fine of U.S. $110,000 if he breaks the ban, the Evening Standard reported.\\n\\nREAD ON THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nThe ruling was not delivered lightly, as the court felt it needed to consider \"conflicting fundamental rights.\"\\n\\nImage shows Jonathan Jacob Meijer, aged 41, from the city of Hague, the Netherlands, undated photo. He was charged with misleading hundreds of women worldwide and fathering nearly 500 children.\\n\\n\"On the on hand, the right to respect for the privacy of the parents and the donor children … and on the other hand, the same right of the donor.\"\\n\\nMeijer’s lawyer explained that his client simply had the desire to help parents who could not otherwise conceive a child on their own.\\n\\nKANSAS NONPROFIT PROVIDES ‘KEEPSAKE SETS’ TO HONOR ‘ANGEL’ BABIES: FAMILY GRIEF ‘MATTERS’\\n\\nBut the judge who heard the case noted that Meijer had breached Dutch law, which allows a sperm donor to produce a maximum of 25 children with 12 mothers. Meijer \"deliberately lied\" to prospective parents about his donation history.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\n\"All these parents are now confronted with the fact that the children in their family are part of a huge kinship network, with hundreds of half-siblings, which they did not choose,\" the court wrote, stressing the potential negative psychosocial consequences for the children.\\n\\nImage shows Jonathan Jacob Meijer, aged 41, from the Hague, the Netherlands, undated photo. He was charged with misleading hundreds of women worldwide and fathering nearly 500 children.\\n\\n\"It is therefore in their interest that this kinship network is not extended any further,\" the court added.\\n\\nEva welcomed the ruling, saying that she hopes it will lead to a ban on mass donation in other countries.\\n\\nCHINESE HIRING AMERICAN WOMEN AS SURROGATES IS A NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT\\n\\n\"We must stand hand in hand around our children and protect them against this injustice,\" she said in a statement.\\n\\nWhen Meijer met with Eva, who chose him as a donor in 2018, he allegedly told her he would stop at the legal limit when he reached it. She later learned that he had hit that limit long before he met her.\\n\\nMeijer may have in fact fathered as many as 102 children in the Netherlands, which prompted officials to blacklist him from any further donations in 2017.\\n\\nMeijer may have in fact fathered as many as 102 children in the Netherlands, which prompted officials to blacklist him from any further donations in 2017. Now living in Kenya, he continued to donate in other countries, including Denmark and Ukraine.\\n\\nThe Dutch Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology urged all sperm banks and clinics to stop using Meijer’s samples after his 2017 blacklisting, but he continued to offer his sperm \"under the counter,\" according to EuroNews.
