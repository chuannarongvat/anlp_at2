0,"Half of North Korean missile program funded by cyberattacks and crypto theft, White House says",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/politics/north-korean-missile-program-cyberattacks/index.html,"      A sweeping US federal government effort is ongoing to understand how “a country like [North Korea] is so darn creative in this space,” Anne Neuberger, deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, said at an event hosted by the nonprofit Special Competitive Studies Project.
  

      US intelligence agencies are working to identify North Korean operatives and the Treasury is tracing stolen cryptocurrency, Neuberger said, adding that the Biden administration is “putting a lot of time and thought” into the problem.
  

      It’s an estimate that suggests hacking and cybercrime are key to the North Korean regime’s survival. Neuberger’s comments come amid heightened international concern over Pyongyang’s missile and nuclear weapons program. A new intercontinental ballistic missile that North Korea tested in April could allow the regime to launch long-range nuclear strikes more quickly, CNN previously reported. 
  

      The Justice Department last month charged a North Korean man with an elaborate money laundering scheme that tapped employees of US cryptocurrency firms to help fund the North Korean regime. 
  

      At a public event last July, Neuberger said that the North Koreans “use cyber to gain, we estimate, up to a third of their funds to fund their missile program.” A spokesperson for Neuberger told CNN on Wednesday that the updated figure she cited this week was accurate. That suggests that the issue has, if anything, only grown in importance in the months since.
  

      North Korean hackers have stolen billions of dollars from banks and cryptocurrency firms over the last several years, providing a key source of revenue for the regime, according to reports from the United Nations and private firms. US officials have long suspected that at least some of that money has been fueling Pyongyang’s weapons development but have rarely spoken publicly in detail about the issue. 
  

      A recent CNN investigation found a rampant effort by North Korean hackers to steal cryptocurrency and launder it into hard cash that might help fund dictator Kim Jong Un’s weapons programs. Another CNN investigation identified one cryptocurrency entrepreneur who said his firm had unwittingly sent a North Korean IT worker tens of thousands of dollars. 
  

      Such North Korean cyber activity is part of regular intelligence products presented to senior US officials, sometimes including President Joe Biden, a senior US official previously told CNN.

1,Austin lambasts ‘irresponsible’ and ‘unprecedented’ Republican hold on military nominations,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/politics/lloyd-austin-senate-letter-abortion-policies-nominations/index.html,"The letter, sent on May 5 in response to a query from Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, addressed the effort spearheaded by Alabama Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville, calling it “irresponsible” and “unprecedented.” Austin also said it undermines the US military’s credibility abroad, and will impose “new and unnecessary risk on US warfighters across multiple theaters of operations.” 
  

      “Ultimately, the breakdown of the normal flow of leadership across the Department’s carefully cultivated promotion and transition system will breed uncertainty and confusion across the US military,” Austin said. “This protracted hold means uncertainty for our service members and their families and rising disquiet from our allies and partners, at a moment when our competitors and adversaries are watching.” 
  

      Tuberville has maintained his hold on general and flag officer nominations in protest of new reproductive health policies instituted throughout the US military, which among other things provide leave and travel allowances for troops or their families who must travel to receive an abortion. 
  

      The policies also extend the timeline in which service members must tell their commanders they are pregnant, and provides up to 21 days of leave for troops seeking in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intrauterine insemination (IUI).  
  

      “The efforts taken by the Department today will not only ensure that service members and their families are afforded time and flexibility to make private health care decisions, but will also ensure service members are able to access non-covered reproductive health care regardless of where they are stationed,” a Pentagon news release outlining the new policies said.
  

      Tuberville, however, has argued that federal funding cannot be used to perform abortions except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother’s life is at risk. He has received support from roughly a dozen other Republicans in the Senate and House, who called the Pentagon’s policies “illegal,” “atrocious,” and “immoral.”
  

      The US military still does not perform abortions except for in covered cases, which applies only to the three aforementioned situations.  
  

      Defense officials have warned that the hold on nominations would negatively impact military readiness and throw a wrench into an otherwise routine system of promotions and moving families to new assignments.
  

      There are currently 196 military nominations pending in the Senate, including the commanders of the Navy’s 7th and 5th Fleets, which cover the Indo-Pacific and Naval Forces Central Command, respectively. It also includes the military representative to NATO. 
  

      In his letter to Warren, Austin said 64 three- and four-star positions are expected to rotate out to a new flag or general officer within the next 120 days, including some of the most senior military commanders – the chief of staff of the Army, chief of Naval Operations, commandant and assistant commandant of the Marine Corps, commander of US Northern Command, and director of the National Security Agency and commander of United States Cyber Command. 
  

      In the coming months, those positions up for nomination will also include the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff – the military’s most senior uniformed leader – and the vice chiefs of staff of the Army and Air Force. 
  

      “Without these leaders in place, the U.S. military will incur an unnecessary and unprecedented degree of risk at a moment when our adversaries may seek to test our resolve,” Austin warned. 
  

      The hold will make it “harder for the United States to fulfill its global leadership responsibilities” around the globe, he goes on to say, and potentially force “out units to operate with less experienced decision makers in charge.” 
  

      It could also have a trickle-down effect on other military officers, whose promotions are “possible only with the retirement of others,” Austin added.
  

      Without the regular promotion and retirement of officers at the top, Austin said the military could experience delayed or canceled permanent change of station moves, which is already an often-hectic process for service members and their families who are moving to new installations for new assignments. 
  

      The Senate approves thousands of civilian and military nominations every year, typically through unanimous consent. But with Tuberville’s block on the process, it could take months to go through each military nomination one at a time, which a Democratic Senate aide previously told CNN could take a year to complete. 
  

      But Austin warned in his letter to Warren that the nominations need to be approved as quickly as possible. 
  

      “This indefinite hold harms America’s national security and hinders the Pentagon’s normal operations. The United States military relies on the deep experience and strategic expertise of our senior military leaders,” he said. “The longer that this hold persists, the greater the risk the US military runs in every theater, every domain, and every service.”

3,E. Jean Carroll says verdict in Trump abuse case is a victory for all victims of sexual assault,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/politics/e-jean-carroll-donald-trump-cnntv/index.html,"      “The old view of the perfect victim was a woman who always screamed. A woman who immediately reported. A woman whose life was supposed to fold up and she’s never supposed to experience happiness again,” Carroll told CNN’s Poppy Harlow on “This Morning.” “That was just shut down with this verdict, the death of the perfect victim has happened. Now this verdict is for all women.”
  

      Asked by Harlow what she was thinking when the jury did not find that Carroll proved Trump raped her, Carroll said, “Well, I just immediately (said) in my own head, ‘Oh, yes, he did. Oh yes, he did.’” When she shook hands with Trump lawyer Joe Tacopina, she said to him, “he did it. And you know it.” 
  

      Carroll alleged that Trump raped her in the Bergdorf Goodman department store and then defamed her when he denied her claim, said she wasn’t his type and suggested she made up the story to boost sales of her book. 
  

      Trump has denied all wrongdoing and does not face any jail time as a result of the civil verdict. He has said he will appeal the verdict. 
  

      Carroll, who called the verdict a “great moment,” said she is happy to get her name back and will soon get a new dog now that the trial is over.
  

      “I’m really sort of taking in the moment and the overwhelming flood of a lot of hate that’s part of it,” she said, adding that she is feeling an “overwhelming amount of relief and joy.”
  

      “There’s a sort of a feeling of victory that, at last, somebody has held him accountable in a courtroom,” Carroll said.

4,Social Security benefits have lost 36% of buying power since 2000,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/politics/social-security-benefits-inflation/index.html,"      Those who retired before 2000 have seen the purchasing power of their benefits drop by 36%, according to The Senior Citizens League. These folks would need a nearly $517 boost in their monthly benefits just to maintain the same level of buying power as in 2000.
  

      Although Social Security recipients get an annual cost-of-living adjustment, the increases have not kept up with the rise in prices for years – squeezing senior citizens, many of whom live on fixed incomes and depend heavily on their monthly Social Security payments.
  

      The surge in inflation in recent years resulted in the largest annual adjustments since the early 1980s. Beneficiaries received an increase of 5.9% for 2022 and 8.7% for 2023.
  

      However, for the past 10 months, inflation has moderated. That means the 2024 adjustment is expected to be lower than in recent years. It won’t be announced until October, but the annual boost would be 3.1% based on current inflation rates, said Mary Johnson, the league’s Social Security and Medicare policy analyst.
  

      Still, prices remain high. The costs for many items used by older Americans grew much faster, according to the league, citing US Bureau of Labor Statistics data. The cost of eggs soared 110% over the year ending in February, while bread and dental visits jumped 18% and 16%, respectively. Electricity and car repairs went up 13% each.
  

      Looking longer term, the annual adjustments increased Social Security benefits by a total of 78% between January 2000 and February 2023. But the cost of goods and services purchased by typical retirees rose by a total of more than 141%, driven by eggs, prescription drugs and heating oil, according to the league.
  

      Put another way, the $100 a retired household spent on groceries in 2000 would buy only $64 worth today.

6,Inside White House meeting on debt ceiling: Intractable positions and no new ground,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/politics/debt-ceiling-negotiations-mccarthy/index.html,"      Literally, no new ground was breached, the source told CNN. 
  

      It’s a reflection of the entrenched positions that have paralyzed negotiations for nearly 100 days now and a dangerous sign for what could be ahead. After making no progress, which House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and others acknowledged publicly on Tuesday night, the speaker ended his meeting with the president on Tuesday afternoon by asking him how did he want to proceed?   
  

      The implication: Was there room to keep talking? President Joe Biden told McCarthy that staff should meet over the subsequent days followed by another meeting Friday.
  

      Leaders left the meeting echoing that plan. 
  

      One of the more telling signs following the meeting Tuesday was how personal both the jabs from the president and speaker seemed to be at one another in separate press availabilities. 
  

      Both men are experienced lawmakers who have keen understandings of the power of relationships in deal making. McCarthy found a way in his young speakership to turn some of his one-time foes into powerful allies that helped cement him a major victory on his own debt ceiling package just two weeks ago. But on Tuesday, Biden accused the speaker of – at times– being “a little over the top,” a subtle but pointed critique of McCarthy’s negotiating style. Both before and after the meeting, McCarthy brought up how he was misled by Biden for 97 days between when they first met and when Biden told him on several occasions they’d get together. They never did.
  

      During the meeting at one point, McCarthy pushed back on what has become a common Democratic attack that the GOP bill cuts funding for veterans. Biden pushed him to explain the cuts. McCarthy said point blank that was a lie. McCarthy later confirmed in his news conference though he made clear he wasn’t calling Biden specifically a liar.
  

      A source familiar with these discussions told CNN that the contours of a potential deal aren’t that difficult to imagine, but at this point no one is actually negotiating anything. 
  

      Potentially, leaders could come up with a two-track plan that could raise the debt ceiling and set future budget caps to reduce spending over time. Messaging wise, that could give everyone an opportunity to claim victory. Still, the source said no one is ready to go there yet. 
  

      The question is whether staff might be able to begin heading in that direction in the days ahead. The White House and Democrats continue to say they want a clean debt ceiling deal. Republicans want to see spending cuts attached to that increase. With just a handful of days of members in session, no one is blinking yet. 
  

      In February when McCarthy and Biden first met and before House Republicans crafted and passed their own bill to rein in spending and raise the debt ceiling, the terms of this negotiation might have just been focused on a caps deal accompanied by a debt ceiling hike. McCarthy had more flexibility. But now, GOP sources tell CNN that House Republicans are far more invested in some of the other provisions that were part of their bill including:
  

      House Republicans are well aware that they won’t get all of that and most are giving the Speaker wide latitude to negotiate with the White House, but the buy in members have on some of those other provisions is real and could be a complicating factor if a substantive negotiation ever gets underway. 
  

      In Congress, things can move as quickly (or as slowly) as negotiators want them to. But it does take time to draft and actually pass bills on the floor. June 1 is just weeks away and if congressional leaders are going to cut a deal with the White House, they don’t have much time to waste. 
  

      McCarthy told reporters Tuesday it was his belief that a framework would need to be agreed upon by next week in order to ensure a deadline wouldn’t be missed. That isn’t hard and fast and again, Congress can move rapidly when they want to (and when there is widespread agreement). But the runway for progress here isn’t that long. There is time for one bad meeting, but there isn’t much time for more than that.

7,Biden to hammer Republican budget cuts which target his student loan forgiveness plans,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/politics/student-loan-forgiveness-republican-attacks/index.html,"      Many of the programs Biden will warn about aren’t actually singled out in the GOP bill, which cuts spending across the board. But there’s at least one program congressional Republicans are specifically targeting – and it could change if and how millions of Americans pay back their federal student loans.
  

      The future of Biden’s federal student loan forgiveness program will first be decided in the Supreme Court, but even if it survives that challenge, the program and the administration’s moves to lower payments for millions of Americans with federal loans are also under attack in Congress.
  

      The House GOP bill would eliminate the federal student loan forgiveness program and block a proposed income-driven repayment plan that aims to reduce monthly payments for many borrowers and lower the total amount of money paid back over time. The new plan is still being finalized, but some provisions are expected to take effect later this year. Unlike the one-time loan forgiveness program, the new income-driven repayment plan would apply to future borrowers as well.  
  

      While the Limit, Save, Grow Act has slim to no chance of ever becoming law, it acts as a sort of wish list for some Republicans on Capitol Hill – and includes proposals that Republicans could try to add to the budget. 
  

      “Prior to the student loan pause we had a million people defaulting a year on loans, and often those are people who weren’t able to complete college or didn’t have the earnings they need to be able to afford to repay those loans,” Undersecretary for Education James Kvaal said in an interview with CNN. 
  

Have you received student debt forgiveness since Biden took office in 2021? Tell us


      “Income-driven repayment plans set your monthly payments based upon your income as a way of making sure that those payments are affordable, and that is a really important option for tens of millions of people with student loans to make sure they can afford their loan payments, and also the other obligations that that they may have in their lives,” Kvaal added. 
  

      Republicans, including Education and the Workforce Committee Chairwoman Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, call the income-driven repayment program “radical,” and say it would, “turn student loans into untargeted grants and cost more than any other regulation in our nation’s history.”
  

      The price of the program isn’t cheap, with estimates ranging from $138 billion over 10 years by the Biden administration to up to $361 billion over the next decade by the Penn Wharton Budget Model. And some experts argue that the new income-driven plan could result in colleges charging higher tuition and, in turn, lead students to more borrowing.
  

      But for millions of Americans, it could mean the difference between making payments and defaulting, particularly after more than three years of not having to budget for payments. 
  

      The Republican proposal would also strip the Department of Education’s power to pause student loan payments in the future as it did at the beginning of the pandemic – during a Republican administration. 
  

      The student loan repayment pause started during former President Donald Trump’s time in office at the beginning of the pandemic. At the time, the Department of Education said borrowers would be able to suspend payments without penalty and without accruing interest for at least 60 days. As the pandemic stretched on longer than anyone expected, so did the pause. 
  

      An automatic pause of payments and interest for six months was then included in the $2 trillion economic stimulus package, which had broad bipartisan support. But earlier this year, lawsuits over the pause started and Republican pushback escalated. Foxx called extending the pause “fiscal insanity” and that continuing the pauses had “real, harmful repercussions for Americans.” 
  

      “This is a policy that until not that long ago, had strong bipartisan support. It allows us to offer immediate relief to families who are struggling in the context of an emergency or in an economic dislocation,” Kvaal said. “It immediately brought relief to American families who are struggling from the pandemic, and that’s a tool that we may need for emergencies as well.” 
  

      He said the ability pause repayments was an “important tool” for the department, one that could be needed again in the future. 
  

      Asked when he thought the issue started to become partisan, Kvaal responded: “Yeah, I don’t know.” 
  

      “I think the President and congressional Republicans have really different visions about what it takes to grow the economy and build the middle class,” he said. 
  

      Some critics argue that the latest extension of the pause is different because the Biden administration tied the restart date to pending litigation over its proposed one-time forgiveness program. SoFi, a private lender, has sued the administration, arguing that the latest extension is unlawful.
  

      Foxx and Rep. Jeff Duncan of South Carolina led a House Republican court fling against what they called the “Biden administration’s student loan bailout,” alleging the legal justification exploited “legislation drafted in the wake of September 11, 2001, meant to assist service members and veterans.” 
  

      But the Department of Education is “very confident in our legal arguments,” Kvaal said. 
  

      “I think it’s unfortunate that student debt relief is before the Supreme Court,” he added. “We feel very strongly that the secretary has the authority to carry out that release. We spent quite a bit of time looking at the legal aspects of that proposal. And in fact, had it up and running – we approved 16 million borrowers for debt relief.” 
  

      The Supreme Court is expected to rule on the case sometime this summer. Repayments will start 60 days after the Supreme Court ruling or 60 days after June 30, whichever comes first. 
  

      The Senate has also separately moved to block the forgiveness program. In March, Republican Sens. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Joni Ernst of Iowa and John Cornyn of Texas, along with 36 other GOP senators, introduced a resolution to overturn it. Biden would very likely veto the resolution if it succeeds in both the Senate and House, but votes would force members of his own party, who have not all been in support of the student loan forgiveness program, to take a public stance.
  

      The pushback from Congress could continue, especially with Republicans in charge of the House. 
  

      But the income-driven repayment programs are also done through regulation, and Kavaal said, “whatever we do by regulation, could be reconsidered by regulation” – but he’s hopeful that a future administration will leave the programs alone. 
  

      “There are … processes we have to go through and the agency would have to show that it had a reason basis for reconsidering the conclusions that we’ve reached on the facts,” he said. “Courts would oversee that basis.”
  

      But, he added: “In my 25 years working on higher education, I haven’t seen a lot of examples of student benefits being taken away. I can’t think of one. I think we are making really important changes here that that I believe will be lasting.” 
  

      Student loan forgiveness was not initially part of candidate Joe Biden’s platform when he ran for president, but was added as a sign of party unity. 
  

      When Biden was the presumptive nominee, the campaign released a raft of policy recommendations crafted by allies of Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The document was the product of weeks of negotiations between the “Unity Task Forces” appointed by Biden and Sanders, the former vice president’s longest-lasting rival in the Democratic presidential primary. The task forces drafted a joint approach to climate change, criminal justice, the economy, education, health care and immigration.
  

      Forgiving certain student loan debt was part of that. A Biden reelection campaign official said that in 2020, youth voter participation saw a double-digit increase – and issues of college affordability may have played a role. 
  

      “We’ve seen high youth vote participation in 2022 mobilized by issues like affordability, like the right to choose, like being safe from violence. And so those are going to be issues that we are going to have to focus on and are actively talking about what young people in groups that organize and mobilize around them,” the Biden 2024 campaign official said. “But the stakes are really, really high here.” 
  

      “The progress that we would like to make is totally under threat from virtually every Republican candidate that is looking to kind of reverse that progress,” the official added. “We know it’s going to take earning every vote.”

8,Trump’s CNN town hall is a sign of a broader and more traditional campaign strategy,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/politics/trump-campaign-strategy-town-hall/index.html,"      The town hall event in New Hampshire Wednesday evening, Trump’s first appearance on CNN since the 2016 election, joins a list of other signs that Trump is adopting a more traditional campaign in his third run for the White House.
  

      The former president has surrounded himself with a more organized, experienced team to complement his unconventional campaign style. He’s also scaling back larger rallies, a Trump campaign trademark, for more intimate campaign settings and retail stops that allow the former president to engage with voters.
  

       “Look, there are three camps of people: those who will always be with Trump, those who aren’t sure and those who will never be with him,” one Trump adviser told CNN. “We are working on getting the support of every single person in that middle category.”
  

      That approach speaks to an acknowledgment by the Trump campaign and its allies that the former president must broaden his appeal inside and outside the Republican Party if he is to clinch the GOP nomination and retake the White House in 2024, following his failed reelection bid and disappointing results by Republicans in last year’s midterm elections. The process is being driven by a team of veteran political operatives, skilled in matters such as the delegate process, who believe Trump’s path to victory cannot simply be a reprisal of his insurgent 2016 bid or his large, expensive 2020 operation.
  

      The former president’s team has increased its outreach with traditional news outlets, taking questions from television and print correspondents on recent campaign swings from organizations Trump has spent years attacking. 
  

      Trump’s team also sees the town hall has an opportunity to draw a contrast with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has clashed with what he often refers to as “legacy media” organizations.
  

      “A lot of Republicans, they get worried about being attacked by the media, they worry about getting smeared, it’s not anything good. I don’t read any of it, so I don’t really care,” DeSantis said last month.
  

      One Trump adviser noted the former president would likely keep his focus on DeSantis and the GOP primary, though some in his orbit have urged him to use the town hall setting and his standing as frontrunner in Republican primary polls to pivot to general election attacks on President Joe Biden.
  

      Three sources close to the former president told CNN there wasn’t any intense preparation for the town hall, but that his team huddled together Tuesday, talked through potential questions and the event with him. One source said the team also touched on his previous positions on different topics. 
  

      “Trump is already prepared,” one source told CNN, saying the goal for the town hall is to amplify his core message.
  

      Advisers to the former president acknowledge he still has work to do to engage with Republican voters outside of his loyal base of supporters, multiple sources told CNN.
  

      “There is a belief that Trump can ‘out-personality’ other candidates,” one of the sources close to the former president told CNN, highlighting Trump’s ability to connect with people.
  

      This is particularly important in the early voting state of New Hampshire, where Trump has already visited twice since launching his third presidential bid. During his first trip in January, Trump delivered the keynote address at the state GOP’s annual meeting, a more understated group of party leaders. He returned last month, inviting supporters from around the Granite State to a packed event in Manchester where he delivered a lengthy address.
  

      In a sign of the anticipation surrounding Trump’s town hall appearance, former Wyoming GOP Rep. Liz Cheney’s PAC launched a new TV ad in New Hampshire calling Trump “unfit for office” and “a risk America can never take again.”
  

      The ad will air on CNN this week, according to a release from the group, called the Great Task PAC. Cheney, who narrates the ad, has said she will do everything in her power to ensure the former president is not elected to the White House again.
  

      “Donald Trump is the only president in American history who has refused to guarantee the peaceful transfer of power,” Cheney says in the ad. “He lost the election and he knew it. He betrayed millions of Americans by telling them the election was stolen. He ignored the rulings of dozens of courts.”
  

      Trump’s town hall also comes as he faces several legal hurdles.
  

      In New York, a jury on Tuesday found Trump liable for sexually abusing and defaming E. Jean Carroll, awarding the writer about $5 million.
  

      Carroll, who sued Trump for battery and defamation, alleged that he raped her in a Manhattan luxury department store dressing room in the spring of 1996 and then defamed her years later when she went public with the allegations.
  

      Trump, who has denied the allegations, called the verdict “a total disgrace” and “continuation of the greatest witch hunt of all time” in a post on Truth Social.
  

      Additionally, Trump pleaded not guilty last month to 34 felony criminal charges of falsifying business records in Manhattan. That case stemmed from hush money payments made during the 2016 campaign to women claiming extramarital affairs with Trump, which he has denied.
  

      The former president is also under scrutiny by special counsel Jack Smith, who is leading a pair of investigations – one into the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and the other on the handling of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago residence. 
  

      Additionally, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis plans to announce charges this summer from the investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia.
  

      Trump, however, has said that he is running for president regardless of the criminal charges he may face, criticizing all of the investigations as politically motivated.

He has said he will continue his campaign regardless of any criminal charges he faces.

10,Georgia Bulldogs championship football team declines White House invitation,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/09/politics/georgia-football-white-house-invitation/index.html,"      “The University of Georgia first received on May 3 an invitation for the Bulldog football team to visit the White House on June 12,” the statement read. “Unfortunately, the date suggested is not feasible given the student-athlete calendar and time of year. However, we are appreciative of the invitation and look forward to other opportunities for Georgia teams moving forward.”
  

      CNN has reached out to the White House for comment. 
  

      The Bulldogs beat the Texas Christian University Horned Frogs 65-7 in January to take home the College Football Playoff National Championship Trophy and end with a 15-0 perfect season.
  

      The team did not visit the White House after its championship last year, nor did the Alabama Crimson Tide the year before, due to Covid-related reasons. 
  

Jill Biden's suggestion for White House invitation sparks controversy


      The Louisiana State University Tigers were the last championship football team to visit the White House in January 2020 – where former President Donald Trump joked about his first impeachment but did not provide the same viral buffet of fast food that awaited the 2018 champions, the Clemson Tigers. 
  

      President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden announced Monday the White House would be hosting the LSU Tigers women’s basketball team and the University of Connecticut Huskies men’s basketball team on May 26 for two ceremonies celebrating each team’s national championship title.
  

      The invitation of the LSU women’s basketball team comes after high-profile criticism from team star Angel Reese after the first lady suggested that both LSU and second-place team University of Iowa should come to the celebratory ceremony. The first lady’s office later walked back her remarks.

11,Biden to meet with congressional leadership again on Friday as threat of national debt default looms,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/09/politics/biden-mccarthy-debt-ceiling-white-house-meeting/index.html,"      House Republicans want to attach spending reductions to a debt ceiling increase and have passed a debt limit plan that does just that. But Biden and congressional Democrats have insisted on passing a clean increase on the debt limit before addressing a framework for spending.
  

      After the meeting, Biden told reporters that White House and congressional leadership staff will meet daily before Friday’s top-level meeting. 
  

      The president said he “made it clear” during the meeting “that default is not an option,” adding that he’s “absolutely certain” the US can avoid defaulting on its obligations because an “overwhelming number of members of … Congress know it would be a disaster.” 
  

      “Look, over these last few days and weeks … there’s a lot of politics, posturing and gamesmanship that’s going to continue for a while. But I am squarely focused on what matters and we’re getting to work,” Biden said in the Roosevelt Room. “As I’ve said all along, let’s discuss what we need to cut, what we need to protect, what new revenue we can raise and how to lower the deficit to put our fiscal house in order. But in the meantime, we need to take the threat of default off the table.” 
  

Why we don't entirely know what would come after a US debt default


      While leaders in the meeting indicated it wasn’t discussed in the Oval Office, president told reporters that he is considering whether to invoke the 14th Amendment to declare the debt limit unconstitutional after Washington resolves the current debt limit issue. He suggested that litigation may take too long to make a difference in current negotiations.
  

      “I’ll be very blunt with you. When we get by this, I’m thinking about taking a look at, months down the road, to see what the court would say about whether or not it does work,” Biden added. 
  

      The president also said he doesn’t think his aides have studied minting a trillion-dollar coin to avoid another debt crisis. 


      He said it’s “possible” but “not likely” that he’ll skip his upcoming foreign travel if the debt ceiling is not raised by the time he is due to leave in late May – just before the US could start to default on June 1.
  

      Although expectations for the meeting were low, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy told reporters that he didn’t see any new movement since his last meeting with the president to discuss the matter in February. 
  

      “I would hope that he’d be willing to negotiate for the next two weeks so we could actually solve this problem and not take America on the brink,” McCarthy said outside the West Wing following the meeting. 
  

      The California Republican said he asked the president for areas where he’d engage on spending reductions, but “he wouldn’t give me any.”
  

      Speaking alongside McCarthy, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell attempted to assuage fears of a default, stating that “the United States is not going to default. It never has and it never will. However, elections have consequences. We now have divided government. We didn’t have a divided government last year.”
  

      However, McCarthy would not offer concrete assurances about preventing default.
  

      “I’m speaker of the House,” he said. “I’m not the leader of the Senate. I’m not the president … I’ve done everything in my power to make sure it will not default. We have passed a bill that raised the debt limit. Now, I haven’t seen that in the Senate.” 
  

      “So,” the speaker continued, “I don’t know.”
  

      House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer also told reporters outside the White House that McCarthy was the only leader in the meeting who would not take default off the table. 
  

      Responding to McCarthy’s reluctance to take default off the table, Biden told reporters, “I don’t know what he thinks. … I think he knows better. I think he knows that default would be disastrous.”
  

      Jeffries said that the meeting attendees are organizing their respective teams “to have a discussion about a path forward around the budget and the appropriations process, and everyone agreed.” 
  

      “That’s progress,” he added.
  

      Officials had indicated Biden’s goal for the meeting was to move spending negotiations onto a separate track, removing the threat of default while giving Republicans assurances he will engage in good-faith negotiations about federal spending. 
  

      Tuesday’s meeting – comprised of the four congressional leaders as well as a handful of congressional and White House aides – marked the first in-person, top-level discussions on the matter at the White House in months. 
  

      Biden had not formally held a meeting with McCarthy since February, when the two last discussed the debt ceiling at the White House.


      McCarthy has signaled opposition to a short-term debt limit lift, but Biden has said the only thing he’s ruling out is default. The speaker also said that Congress will need deal in principle to lift debt limit by next week.
  

      Heading into Tuesday’s meeting, McCarthy had more leverage than many expected him to have and House Republicans remain largely behind him. 
  

      “There isn’t a single bright line or ‘must have’ that I am married to,” South Dakota GOP Rep. Dusty Johnson, a key McCarthy ally, told CNN. “The totality of the deal has to make real and substantial change to how our country spends and borrows. There are lots of different ways to get there.”
  

      Many House Republicans believe the speaker has built trust within their ranks over the last several months – a testament, they say, to a leader who barely clinched the speakership after a historic 15 rounds of voting.
  

      A source close to McCarthy said the speaker – after months of listening sessions and meetings – feels comfortable with where his conference’s hard lines and negotiable provisions lie. He’s spent the last several days touching base with Republican members across the ideological spectrum and speaking with Louisiana GOP Rep. Garret Graves, who he selected to take lead as a policy adviser on this issue. 
  

      Asked what would be a victory in negotiations with the White House, North Dakota Republican Rep. Kelly Armstrong said, “Kevin getting us the best deal he can after the White House engages in good faith negotiations.”
  

      “I recognize what I want and what can get 60 votes in the Senate may not be the same,” he added. 
  

McConnell – known as a Senate deal maker with stronger ties to Biden than McCarthy – has signaled that he won’t come to rescue Democrats in negotiations.
  

      “The solution to this problem lies with two people, the president United States, who can sign a bill and deliver the members of his party to vote for it, and the Speaker of the House,” McConnell told reporters after Tuesday’s meeting. “There is no sentiment in the Senate – certainly not 60 votes – for a clean debt ceiling. So there must be an agreement and the sooner the president and the speaker can reach an agreement, the sooner we can solve the problem.” 
  

In the Senate, all but six Senate Republicans have vowed to oppose raising the debt ceiling “without substantive spending and budget reforms,” backing McCarthy’s position.
  

      The US hit the debt ceiling set by Congress in January. That forced the Treasury Department to begin taking extraordinary measures to keep the government paying its bills. And Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently warned that the US could default on its obligations as soon as June 1 if Congress doesn’t address the debt limit.
  

      A breach of the US debt ceiling risks sparking a 2008-style economic catastrophe that wipes out millions of jobs and sets America back for generations, Moody’s Analytics has warned. The impact could include delayed Social Security payments, late paychecks for federal employees and veterans and a direct hit to Americans’ investments.

12,Notable legal clouds that continue to hang over Donald Trump in 2023,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/20/politics/donald-trump-legal-clouds/index.html,"      In New York, a hush money payment to an adult film star has resulted in his indictment by a Manhattan grand jury over his alleged role in the scheme – the first time in American history that a current or former president faces criminal charges.
  

      Also in Manhattan, a federal jury found Trump sexually abused former advice columnist E. Jean Carroll in a luxury department store dressing room in the mid-1990s and awarded her about $5 million in the battery and defamation civil case.
  

      In Atlanta, a select grand jury has investigated the efforts by Trump and allies to overturn his election loss in Georgia in 2020.
  

      In Washington, a Justice Department special counsel is looking at the 2020 election aftermath and the removal of presidential documents to Florida.
  

      Trump and his company deny any wrongdoing or criminality in all matters, state and federal, and he has aggressively maintained his innocence. 
  

      Here’s an updated list of notable investigations, lawsuits and controversies:
  

      Trump has been charged in Manhattan criminal court with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to his role in a hush money payment scheme involving adult film actress Stormy Daniels late in the 2016 presidential campaign.
  

      The former president surrendered and was placed under arrest April 4, before he was arraigned in a historic and unprecedented court appearance, at which he pleaded not guilty. 
  

      Prosecutors, led by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, accuse Trump of falsifying business records with the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign. 
  

      The indictment has sent shockwaves across the country, pushing the American political system – which has never seen one of its ex-leaders confronted with criminal charges, let alone while running again for president – into uncharted waters. 
  

Donald Trump indicted by Manhattan grand jury


      The $130,000 payment was paid by former Trump attorney and fixer Michael Cohen to Daniels to remain quiet about an alleged affair between Daniels and Trump years earlier.
  

      Trump has denied having an affair with Daniels and says the probe by Bragg, a Democrat, is politically motivated.
  

      Trump is now seeking to move the case to federal court.
  

Special counsel Jack Smith is overseeing the Justice Department’s criminal investigations into the retention of national defense information at Trump’s resort and into parts of the January 6, 2021, insurrection.
  

      The Justice Department investigation continues into whether documents from the Trump White House were illegally mishandled when they were taken to Mar-a-Lago in Florida after he left office. A federal grand jury has interviewed potential witnesses regarding how Trump handled the documents.
  

RELATED: The big numbers from the Mar-a-Lago search


      The National Archives, charged with collecting and sorting presidential material, has previously said that at least 15 boxes of White House records were recovered from Mar-a-Lago, including some classified records. 
  

      Any unauthorized retention or destruction of White House documents could violate a criminal law that prohibits the removal or destruction of official government records, legal experts told CNN.  
  

      Smith’s purview also includes the period after Trump’s 2020 election loss to Joe Biden and leading up to the insurrection at the US Capitol.
  

      As part of its investigation, the special counsel’s office has sought testimony from a number of key White House insiders, including former Vice President Mike Pence, Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner. 
  

      Aspects of the Justice Department’s probe include the use of so-called fake electors from states that Trump falsely claimed he had won, such as Georgia and Arizona.
  

      Trump has been fighting to keep former advisers from testifying about certain conversations, citing executive and attorney-client privileges to keep information confidential or slow down criminal investigators.
  

      Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis oversaw a special grand jury investigating what Trump or his allies may have done in their efforts to overturn Biden’s victory in Georgia.
  

      Willis, a Democrat, is considering bringing conspiracy and racketeering charges, CNN’s Don Lemon has reported.
  

      The probe was launched in 2021 following Trump’s call that January with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, in which he pushed the Republican to “find” votes to overturn the election results.
  

      The grand jury issued a report – which remains mostly under seal – that found there was no widespread voter fraud in the state and also suggested perjury charges be considered against some people who testified. 
  

      Overall, the grand jury recommended charges against more than a dozen people, the foreperson said in interviews in February.
  

      The House select committee that investigated the attack on the US Capitol uncovered dramatic evidence of Trump’s actions before and on January 6, especially efforts to use the levers of government to overturn the election. 
  

      It issued an 845-page report – based on 1,000-plus interviews and documents collected, including emails, texts and phone records – that alleges Trump “oversaw” the legally dubious effort to put forward fake slates of electors in seven states he lost. Evidence shows, the report said, that Trump actively worked to “transmit false Electoral College ballots to Congress and the National Archives.”
  

Key takeaways from the January 6 committee's final report


      In a symbolic move, the committee referred Trump to the Justice Department on at least four criminal charges before it concluded at the end of 2022, ahead of Republicans taking control of the House. 
  

      New York Attorney General Letitia James, after a lengthy investigation, sued Trump, three of his adult children and the Trump Organization in September, alleging they were involved in an expansive fraud lasting over a decade that the former president used to enrich himself.
  

      James alleged the fraud touched all aspects of the Trump business, including its properties and golf courses. According to the lawsuit, the Trump Organization deceived lenders, insurers and tax authorities by inflating the value of his properties using misleading appraisals.
  

      James is seeking $250 million in allegedly ill-gotten funds.
  

      Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and has called the investigation politically motivated based on the electoral ambitions of James, a Democrat.
  

      A trial is set for October 2023.
  

      Trump’s namesake business, the Trump Organization, was convicted in December by a New York jury of tax fraud, grand larceny and falsifying business records in what prosecutors allege was a 15-year scheme to defraud tax authorities by failing to report and pay taxes on compensation provided to employees.
  

Trump Organization found guilty on all counts of criminal tax fraud


      Manhattan prosecutors told a jury the case is about “greed and cheating,” laying out an alleged 15-year scheme within the Trump Organization to pay high-level executives in perks like luxury cars and apartments without paying taxes on them.
  

      Former Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg pleaded guilty to his role in the tax scheme. He was released after serving four months in jail at Rikers Island.
  

      Carroll alleged Trump raped her in a Bergdorf Goodman department store in New York in the spring of 1996 and then defamed her when he denied her claim, said she wasn’t his type and suggested she made up the story to boost sales of her book. 
  

      The jury found him liable for battery based on the sexual assault claim, that he should pay about $2 million in damages to Carroll for the civil battery claim and that he should pay her nearly $3 million in damages for successfully proving her defamation claim against him.
  

      While the jury found that Trump sexually abused her, sufficient to hold him liable for battery, the jury did not find that Carroll proved he raped her.
  

      Trump denied all claims brought against him by Carroll and called the civil trial verdict “a total disgrace.”
  

      Like any defendant in a civil case, Trump was not required to appear in court for trial or any proceedings and had a right not to testify in his own defense. He did not attend the trial.
  

      Several members of the US Capitol Police and Washington, DC, Metropolitan Police are suing Trump, saying his words and actions incited the 2021 riot. 
  

      The various cases accuse Trump of directing assault and battery; aiding and abetting assault and battery; and violating Washington laws that prohibit incitement of riots and disorderly conduct.
  

Federal appeals court considers Trump's plea to grant him immunity from Capitol riot lawsuits


      Trump and his top advisers have not been charged with any crimes. The former president and others who have been sued have argued they are not responsible for the actions of the people who stormed the Capitol.
  

A federal appeals court is considering Trump’s attempt to throw out the cases.
  

      Former top FBI counterintelligence official Peter Strzok, who was fired by the FBI in 2018 after the revelation of anti-Trump texts he had exchanged with a top lawyer at the bureau, Lisa Page, has sued the Justice Department alleging he was terminated improperly. 
  

      Strzok and Page were constant targets of verbal attacks by Trump and his allies as part of the larger ire Trump expressed toward the FBI during the Trump-Russia investigation. Trump repeatedly and publicly called for Strzok’s ouster until he was fired in August 2018. 
  

      A federal judge ruled that Trump and FBI Director Christopher Wray can be deposed for two hours each as part of the lawsuit. 
  

      A federal judge in September dismissed Trump’s lawsuit against Hillary Clinton, the Democratic National Committee, several ex-FBI officials and more than two dozen other people and entities that he claims conspired to undermine his 2016 campaign by trying to vilify him with fabricated information tying him to Russia.
  

      “What (Trump’s lawsuit) lacks in substance and legal support it seeks to substitute with length, hyperbole, and the settling of scores and grievances,” US District Judge Donald Middlebrooks wrote.
  

      Trump is appealing the decision, but Middlebrooks also ruled that the former president and his attorneys are liable for nearly $1 million in sanctions for bringing the case in the first place.
  

      “No reasonable lawyer would have filed it,” Middlebrooks wrote. “Intended for a political purpose, none of the counts of the amended complaint stated a cognizable legal claim.”
  

      Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen sued Trump, former Attorney General William Barr and others, alleging they put him back in jail to prevent him from promoting his upcoming book while under home confinement.
  

      Cohen was serving the remainder of his sentence for lying to Congress and campaign violations at home, due to Covid-19 concerns, when he started an anti-Trump social media campaign in summer 2020. Cohen said he was sent back to prison in retaliation and spent 16 days in solitary.
  

      A federal judge threw out the lawsuit in November. District Judge Lewis Liman said he was empathetic to Cohen’s position but that Supreme Court precedent bars him from allowing the case to move forward.
  

      In 2020, Mary Trump sued her uncle, Donald Trump, his sister Maryanne Trump Barry, a retired judge, and the executor of her late uncle Robert Trump’s estate, alleging that “they designed and carried out a complex scheme to siphon funds away from her interests, conceal their grift, and deceive her about the true value of what she had inherited.”
  

      In November 2022, a New York state judge threw out the lawsuit, saying Mary Trump’s claims are barred by an earlier settlement she reached over 20 years ago. Mary Trump has appealed.
  

      Trump sued journalist Bob Woodward in January 2023 for alleged copyright violations, claiming Woodward had released audio from their interviews without Trump’s consent.
  

      Woodward and publisher Simon & Schuster said Trump’s case is without merit.
  

      Woodward conducted several interviews with Trump for “Rage,” published in September 2020. Woodward later released “The Trump Tapes,” an audiobook featuring eight hours of raw interviews with Trump interspersed with the author’s commentary. 
  

      The former president in 2021 sued his niece and The New York Times in New York state court over the disclosure of his tax information.
  

      Trump’s lawsuit – which is seeking “damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but believed to be no less than One Hundred Million Dollars” – alleges that Mary Trump’s disclosure of the tax information to the Times amounted to an illegal breach of contract, among other claims, because the disclosure allegedly violated the 2001 settlement agreement among the Trump family.
  

      A judge in May threw out the lawsuit against the Times. 
  

      “The Times’s coverage of Donald Trump’s taxes helped inform the public through meticulous reporting on a subject of overriding public interest,” the Times said in a statement. “This lawsuit is an attempt to silence independent news organizations and we plan to vigorously defend against it.”
  

      Donald Trump also sued CNN in a southern Florida federal court last fall, accusing the network of a “campaign of dissuasion in the form of libel and slander” that “escalated in recent months.”
  

      CNN has asked the judge for the case to be “dismissed with prejudice.”

13,First on CNN: DeSantis takes steps to again send migrants to Democratic-led cities,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/09/politics/desantis-migrant-flights/index.html,"      Florida has selected multiple companies to execute the next phase of DeSantis’ migrant relocation program, according to a source familiar with the process, setting in motion plans to transport migrants to other cities just as he did last year.
  

      The new contracts come as the Biden administration grapples with an influx of migrants at the US-Mexico border in anticipation of a Covid-era border restriction, known as Title 42, expiring this week. And it sets up DeSantis to once again thrust himself into the country’s fierce immigration debate just as he is expected to launch a 2024 presidential campaign.
  

      In a statement to CNN, Florida Division of Emergency Management spokeswoman Alecia Collins confirmed the state had “selected multiple vendors based on their capabilities to carry out the program.”
  

      Republican governors have repeatedly slammed President Joe Biden’s handling of the US-Mexico border, prompting Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to start busing migrants to Democratic-led cities. The White House, in response, has pushed back, calling efforts to transport migrants without coordinating with receiving cities “political stunts.”
  

      “We’re using the tools that we have in front of us to deal with this issue,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Monday, referring to the growing number of migrants crossing the US southern border. “Republican officials want to do something else –they want to campaign on this issue, they want to do political stunts, that’s what we’re seeing from the Governor of Texas.”
  

      The number of buses headed north slowed in recent months as border crossings dropped, but is ramping back up again. 
  

      Last September, DeSantis arranged for two flights to carry migrants from San Antonio to Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts, releasing almost 50 migrants on an unsuspecting vacation community. Though derided as a stunt by the White House and roundly criticized by immigrant advocates, his exploits earned DeSantis wide acclaim from Republicans and glowing coverage from conservative media. 
  

      It’s not clear if the companies recently selected by the DeSantis administration will be tasked with transporting people from Florida or if they will operate in states near the border. As Florida sought vendors for DeSantis’ migrant transport, it repeatedly refused to divulge those specifics, telling companies those details will be provided later when their services are requested, according to procurement records. 
  

      DeSantis, too, has been coy about how he intends to use the $22 million that Florida’s legislature has set aside for his migrant transport program. At a recent news conference, DeSantis deflected when asked when the program would continue, though he hinted future action was on the horizon.
  

      “We may be having an announcement soon about maybe a more coordinated effort to respond to what is a catastrophic failure of policy on behalf of the federal government,” DeSantis said Friday.
  

      The state’s request for proposals to administer the transport program, released March 31, suggests changes are afoot.
  

      In a one-page list of objectives, companies were told they would be in charge of nearly every facet of the journey, from identifying and vetting potential migrants to providing them food and lodging to coordinating their arrival and arranging for services. 
  

      That proposed arrangement marks a strategy shift from the September missions to Martha’s Vineyard, when a top aide to DeSantis, Larry Keefe, helped coordinate the flights and worked with a former Army counterintelligence agent to recruit migrants in San Antonio by offering them food and money and promising them jobs and help with the immigration process. The clandestine nature of that mission, detailed in public records and interviews, drew widespread condemnation from immigrant advocates, who called their efforts manipulative. 
  

      Now, it will be up to the companies to recruit people to transport. The DeSantis administration declined to respond when asked how its chosen vendors planned to identify and vet migrants.
  

      But the DeSantis administration provided few additional details to vendors on the scope of the program. Companies had just four days to ask the state questions about the work and were given two weeks to respond with their offers, according to a timeline advertised by the state. 
  

      The Florida Division of Emergency Management, responding to written questions from prospective vendors, wouldn’t say where migrants will be picked up or where they will be sent to, how many migrants would be moved per trip, the typical length of the journey, how much they should expect to be paid or whether meals provided to migrants should be hot or cold. 
  

      Nor would the division provide guidance on how transport companies should connect migrants to social services once a destination is reached, as required under the program. 
  

      “Vendors should propose how they plan to identify social services at the destination and how they plan to provide information regarding social services to the participants of this program,” the division wrote in response to one question.
  

      Vendors were told they need to provide translators for Spanish and Haitian-Creole and comply with all state and federal laws. They have been instructed to destroy any duplicates of public records created during the missions. Companies will be expected to provide on-demand transportation and will have just three days to mobilize once the state requests their services. 
  

      Only people who have been processed by the Department of Homeland Security are eligible for transportation, the request for proposals said.
  

      As the state sought contractors to do the work, confusion lingered about what companies were being asked to do. Vendors asked repeatedly what additional “ancillary services” they needed to provide other than meals and lodging, but the state said it was up to them to propose that.
  

      One company asked if migrants would be allowed to get off the bus before they reached their destination.
  

      “Yes,” the state responded. “This program is entirely voluntary.”
  

      Another question posed whether participating vendors needed plans to separate men, women and children. The state responded that it “does not anticipate” relocating children without a parent or guardian.
  

      “The plan should ensure that all Unauthorized Alien individuals are housed in a safe and appropriate manner,” the state said.
  

      The last question the state received inquired what documentation was needed to determine whether someone was eligible to transport.
  

      It was up to the vendors to figure that out, the state said.

14,What E. Jean Carroll had to prove to win her case against Donald Trump,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/09/politics/carroll-trump-jury-deliberations/index.html,"      The panel in a Manhattan federal courtroom considered Carroll’s allegations that Trump raped her in a Bergdorf Goodman lingerie department dressing room in the spring of 1996, and then defamed her in a social media post last October. Trump has denied the allegations and called the verdict “a total disgrace” Tuesday.  
  

      Here’s what the jury group of six men and three women, whose identities are anonymous to the lawyers and the public, considered:
  

      Carroll filed the lawsuit last November under the “New York State Adult Survivors Act,” a state bill which opened a look-back window for sexual assault allegations like Carroll’s with long-expired statutes of limitation. 
  

      This is not a criminal trial. In a civil suit like Carroll’s, the jury had to determine whether Carroll’s legal team proved that Trump committed battery against Carroll by a preponderance of the evidence.
  

      While the jury found that Trump sexually abused her, sufficient to hold him liable for battery, the jury did not find that Carroll proved he raped her.
  

      To prove her defamation claim, the jury had to find that Carroll’s legal team proved by the preponderance of the evidence that Trump knew it was false when he published the statement about Carroll last year and knowingly exposed her to public ridicule. They also had to determine that she proved by clear and convincing evidence that the statement was false, and that Trump made the statement with actual malice.
  

      Both the preponderance of the evidence standard and the clear and convincing evidence standard are not as high a standard as proof beyond a reasonable doubt, which is used in criminal cases. Clear and convincing evidence is higher than preponderance of the evidence, which means more likely than not. Clear and convincing evidence leaves no substantial doubt in the juror’s mind and establishes that the proposition is highly probable. 
  

      The jury had to be unanimous to reach a verdict but could have reached a different verdict on each of the two claims – battery and defamation. 
  

      The jury found that Trump should pay nearly $3 million in damages to Carroll for successfully proving her defamation claim against him and about $2 million for her civil battery claim. 
  

      Carroll receiving a monetary award from this trial hinged on whether the jury unanimously believed her claims against Trump.  
  

      Carroll’s lawyers had not suggested an amount in damages for the jury to consider.
  

      “For E. Jean Carroll this lawsuit is not about the money,” attorney Roberta Kaplan said during closing arguments on Monday. “It’s about getting her good name back.”
  

      “What is the price for decades of living alone without companionship, for having no one to cook dinner with, no one to walk your dog with, no one to watch TV with, and for feeling for decades like you are dirty and unworthy,” Kaplan said. “I’m not going to put a number on that for you.”
  

      Trump did not attend the trial. Like any defendant in a civil case, he was not required to appear in court for trial or any proceedings and has a right not to testify in his own defense. 
  

      Carroll’s attorneys told the jury at closings that they should take Trump’s absence from court as a sign of culpability. 
  

      “She showed up, she swore an oath, and told you what happened, and meanwhile, Donald Trump was nowhere to be found, didn’t come into the courtroom, didn’t take the witness stand. And you should draw the conclusion that that’s because he did it, because he raped Ms. Carroll and he didn’t want to testify about it,” Carroll attorney Michael Ferrara said Monday.
  

      Trump’s attorney alternatively told jurors that Trump didn’t need to come to court to make the same denials he did in a deposition that was played during the trial.
  

      “How do you prove a negative?” Joe Tacopina said. “Challenging the story is our defense. There are no witnesses for us to call. There’s no witness for us to call because he was not there, it didn’t happen.”
  

      Trump’s video deposition taken last October and played for the jury during Carroll’s case was made public Friday. 
  

      Trump appears the most agitated on the video when he denies Carroll’s rape allegation. “She’s accusing me of rape, a woman that I have no idea who she is. It came out of the blue. She’s accusing me of rape – of raping her, the worst thing you can do, the worst charge. And you know it’s not true too. You’re a political operative also. You’re a disgrace. But she’s accusing me and so are you of rape, and it never took place,” Trump said on video, addressing Kaplan.
  

      At one point during the deposition, Trump held a well-known black and white photo of himself, Carroll, her former husband news anchor John Johnson, and Trump’s then-wife Ivana. Trump recognized Johnson and recalled thinking he was good at his television job, but then mistook Carroll for his other ex-wife Marla Maples.
  

      “That’s Marla, yeah. That’s my wife,” he said.
  

      After the attorneys corrected him, Trump said the photo was blurry.
  

      He acknowledged the photo suggests he met Carroll at least once but said it must have been very brief at an event and he does not remember or know her.
  

      “I still don’t know this woman. I think she’s a whack job. I have no idea. I don’t know anything about this woman other than what I read in stories and what I hear. I know nothing about her,” the former president said.
  

      At closings the jury again saw the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape and heard Trump describe how he aggressively moves on women without their consent because they let you “when you’re a star” and Trump’s response to the tape during his deposition.
  

      Trump revealed his “playbook” for handling women on the tape when he thought no one was listening, Kaplan said. “Telling you in his very own words how he treats women.”
  

      Tacopina responded by criticizing Trump’s language on the tape but said the crude nature still doesn’t make Carroll’s allegations true. The lawyer also called the tape that’s been public since before the 2016 presidential election a distraction.
  

      “They are trying to take parts of Donald Trump you dislike or even hate and stretch that over a story that makes no sense whatsoever,” Tacopina said. “You could think Donald Trump is a rude and crude person and that her story makes no sense. Both of those could be true.”
  

      Carroll testified for more than two full trial days during her case, recounting her story, how life has been since going public with her accusations and undergoing several hours of cross examination.
  

      Two friends that Carroll testified she told soon after the alleged rape testified about their recollection of Carroll’s account in 1996. Journalist Lisa Birnbach testified to corroborate Carroll’s story that she called her minutes after she left the department store after she was allegedly raped. 
  

      Former local New York anchor Carol Martin also testified that Carroll, who had a show at the same cable news network at the time, also confided in her within days after the alleged incident. Birnbach and Martin, who were not initially named in Carroll’s book, publicly came forward in support of their friend soon after Carroll published her account in New York magazine.
  

      Trump’s legal team has accused the two of conspiring with Carroll to fabricate this story to bring down Trump. All three have spoken publicly and in private messages shown to the jury about their hatred for the former president. 
  

E. Jean Carroll sounded 'breathless' and 'emotional' in call after alleged rape, friend testifies


      Jessica Leeds and Natasha Stoynoff, who allege Trump physically forced himself on them, also testified about their alleged altercations. 
  

      At closing Carroll’s attorney argued that allegations from Carroll, Leeds and Stoynoff reveal a pattern of Trump’s aggressive behavior. 
  

      In each woman’s testimony, they described how Trump first engaged them in a semipublic place, then allegedly grabbed them suddenly, then later denied the allegations and said “she is too ugly for anyone to assault,” Kaplan said.
  

      “Three different women, decades apart, but one single pattern of behavior. What happened to Ms. Carroll is not unique in that respect. Trump’s physical attacks and verbal attacks are his standard operational procedure,” Kaplan said.
  

      Trump has denied Leeds’ and Stoynoff’s allegations against him. Tacopina told the jurors Monday that their testimony was a distraction at trial because their claims are not before this jury and don’t affect Carroll’s allegations.
  

      Tacopina in his closing argument Monday also accused Carroll of fabricating her rape allegations to sell her book.
  

      “She has abused this system by bringing a false claim for, amongst other things, money, status, political reasons,” Tacopina said. “And in doing so, she has minimized real rape victims, you know, rape victims down by the water and around the world, to use someone’s words. She is exploiting their pain and suffering and is capitalizing on their stories, and we can’t let her profit to the tune of millions of dollars for her abuse of this process and her efforts to deceive you.”
  

      Dr. Leslie Lebowitz, a clinical psychologist contracted by Carroll’s legal team, testified last week that she evaluated Carroll and found that she has no signs of thought or character disorders or mental illness, or PTSD but that she has been harmed by the alleged rape by Trump.
  

      “She has suffered from painful intrusive memories for many years,” Lebowitz said. “She endured a diminishment in how she thought and felt about herself and perhaps most prominently she manifests very notable avoidance symptoms which have curtailed her romantic and intimate life and caused profound loss.”
  

      Northwestern University Marketing Professor Ashlee Humphreys, another expert witness called by Carroll’s lawyers, testified that Trump’s statement at issue in this trial reached somewhere between 13.7 and 18 million impressions.
  

      Humphreys and a team of researchers evaluated the post first published on Truth Social and how it spread across mediums like other social media platforms, websites and cable and network broadcast television.
  

      In a series of calculations, Humphreys said about 21% of the people who viewed the statement in some capacity – about 3.7 to 5.6 million people – likely believed Trump. 
  

      The analysis did not consider the effects of previous statements Trump made about Carroll and on cross examination Humphreys acknowledged that she did not consider damage done to Trump by Carroll’s statements against him.
  

      Still the marketing expert testified it would take up to $2.7 million to run an effective marketing campaign to repair Carroll’s reputation just from the damage of Trump’s October 12, 2022, comments denying her allegations.

15,GOP megadonor Harlan Crow rebuffs congressional request to disclose details about travel and real estate deals with Clarence Thomas,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/09/politics/harlan-crow-senate-democrats-clarence-thomas/index.html,"      “We have serious concerns about the scope of and authority for this inquiry,” Michael D. Bopp, a lawyer for Crow, said in a letter to Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden on Monday evening and obtained by CNN.
  

      “Given the Letter’s timing and focus, this inquiry appears to be a component of a broader campaign against Justice Thomas and, now, Mr. Crow, rather than an investigation that furthers a valid legislative purpose,” Bopp wrote.
  

      Wyden sent a series of questions to Crow in a letter last month, inquiring about trips over the years that the megadonor paid for on his private plane and super yacht that Thomas chose not to list on his financial disclosure forms. 
  

      Separately, on Monday, Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee penned a similar letter to Crow. The letter – signed by all the Democrats on the committee including Dianne Feinstein – requests information on all gifts and payments that exceed $415 that were given to any justice of the Supreme Court or family member as well as an itemized list of real estate transactions and trips.
  

      In his letter to the Finance Committee chairman, Bopp argues that Wyden is seeking to launch an invalid tax audit of Crow and Thomas instead of carrying out a legitimate inquiry into matters that concern the committee, and he charged the senator with violating the separation of powers.
  

      He stressed that Justice Thomas and his wife Ginni are long-time friends of Crow.
  

      “While the Crows have provided hospitality to the Thomases, that hospitality is rooted in a deep friendship, and the Crows derive great satisfaction from spending time with their friends. Personal hospitality is a cherished part of our communal fabric,” he wrote.
  

      Last month, Thomas himself released a rare statement noting that he and his wife had been friends “for over twenty-five years.”
  

      “As friends do, we have joined them on a number of family trips during the more than quarter century we have known them,” Thomas wrote.
  

      Wyden had raised the possibility that the hospitality may have required disclosure on federal filings, which generally require taxpayers to report gifts in excess of a certain amount. The letter also indicated an interest in examining whether the travel was recorded on tax records as a business expense. Wyden also questioned a real estate deal between Crow, Thomas and members of his family. 
  

      Wyden said in a statement Tuesday that he was “disappointed but unsurprised” by Crow’s refusal to answer his questions, arguing that Crow is “relying on the same baseless arguments that failed Donald Trump in his attempt to stonewall Congressional oversight.”
  

      “The bottom line is that nobody can expect to get away with waving off Finance Committee oversight, no matter how wealthy or well-connected they may be,” Wyden said, promising a “full response to Mr. Crow’s attorney in the coming days.”
  

      “I’m also going to discuss with my committee colleagues how best to compel answers to the questions I put forward last month, including by using any of the tools at our disposal,” Wyden added. 
  

      Judiciary Democrats also sent letters on Monday to the holding companies that own Crow’s private jet, private yacht and Topridge Camp “seeking to identify the full extent of Mr. Crow’s and the corporations’ gifts to Justice Thomas.”
  

      “The appearance of special access to the Justices – that is not available to all Americans – is corrosive to the legitimacy of the Court because, at minimum, it creates an appearance of undue influence that undermines the public’s trust in the Court’s impartiality,” one letter states. 
  

      The letters also state that the recent revelations come amid a lack of American confidence in the Supreme Court, pointing to recent polling. 


      Each letter requests that necessary information be shared no later than May 22. 
  

      The controversy about the court’s ethics rules stems from ProPublica reporting that revealed Thomas and his wife had gone on several luxury trips involving travel subsidized by and stays at properties owned by Crow and a 2014 real estate deal that involved the sale of three properties in Savannah, Georgia, that were owned by Thomas and his relatives to the megadonor. 
  

      Thomas had not financially disclosed the hospitality from or the deal with the Texas billionaire. 
  

      He has previously said he followed the advice of others in deciding what required disclosure and in a statement last month noted that Crow did not have business before the court.
  

      A source close to Thomas previously told CNN that the justice plans to amend his disclosure forms to reflect the real estate transaction, which also went unreported.
  

      ProPublica additionally reported last week that Crow paid boarding school tuition for Thomas’ grandnephew, Mark Martin, who lived with the justice’s family as a child and for whom Thomas became a legal guardian. 
  

      Democrats have vowed to keep investigating the ethics of the nation’s highest court, and Chief Justice John Roberts declined an invitation to testify at a hearing on Supreme Court ethics.
  

      Speaking to CNN’s Jake Tapper on Sunday, Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin said “everything is on the table” as the panel scrutinizes new ethics concerns around Thomas.

16,FBI disrupts Russian hacking tool used to steal information from foreign governments,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/09/politics/fbi-disrupts-russian-hacking-tool/index.html,"      The action appears to be a major blow to Russia’s domestic intelligence service, the FSB, which has allegedly used the sophisticated hacking tool to infiltrate US and Western diplomatic and military agencies for nearly two decades. It’s the latest move by the Justice Department to more aggressively target foreign spying and criminal rings using custom-built FBI tools.
  

      The FBI used a court order on Monday to cut off the Russians access to the network of computers in the US that the hackers were using to spirit the stolen information around the world and back to Russia, US officials said. The FBI operation and US public advisories on the hacking tool would make it “difficult or and untenable” for the FSB to effectively use it again, a senior FBI official said in a call with reporters Tuesday. 
  

      FSB operatives, for example, used the hacking tool to “access and exfiltrate sensitive international relations documents, as well as other diplomatic communications” from an unnamed NATO country, the US and its “Five Eyes” allies said in an advisory on Tuesday. 
  

      The Russian Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
  

      The Russian hacking group that the FBI targeted, known as Turla, is widely believed by experts to be one of the most elite cyber-espionage units in the Russian intelligence services. Turla’s tools are associated with a big breach of US military networks in the mid-to-late 1990s and a hack of US Central Command in 2008.
  

      In recent years, the hackers have been observed burrowing into the networks of foreign ministries and parliaments in Eastern Europe to collect intelligence on Russian adversaries. 
  

      The Russian group has also exploited the work of other spy agencies. In 2018, Turla hijacked an Iranian hacking tool to gain access to the network of an unnamed Middle Eastern government, according to researchers.
  

      Turla operatives are “genuine professionals,” Juan Andres Guerrero-Saade, a researcher who has tracked Turla for years, told CNN. 
  

      “They’re not traipsing around breaking things or calling attention to themselves in stupid ways,” said Guerrero-Saade, who is senior director of SentinelLabs, the research arm of security firm SentinelOne. He said that’s what you’d “expect from the GRU,” referring to Russia’s military intelligence agency, whose hackers are generally more conspicuous. “You don’t see that out of Turla.”
  

      Turla’s reputation as one of the Kremlin’s premier hacking teams has inspired private researchers and journalists to track the hackers down. 
  

      A 2022 investigation by German public broadcaster Bayerische Rundfunk traced some Turla operations to an FSB-connected company in the Russian city of Ryazan, about 120 miles southeast of Moscow. The US and allies’ advisory confirmed that daily Turla hacking operations occur at an FSB facility in Ryazan.
  

      While the FBI touted the action as another example of the bureau’s strategy to protect hacking victims, Guerrero-Saade wondered what visibility the FBI might have lost into Turla’s operations by exposing the network of hacked computers. 
  

      “The FBI has a hammer and they’ve decided this is just another nail,” Guerrero-Saade said. “And I don’t think espionage operations should be handled the same way that criminal operations are.”

17,‘Don’t freak out’: Notes from defense table during the Proud Boys seditious conspiracy trial,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/09/politics/proud-boys-trial-notes/index.html,"      The five defendants – all in their 30s and 40s – also passed notes with each other and their lawyers about their legal strategy, saying they needed to “solidify arguments” and provide “better explanations” for chat messages that celebrated the January 6, 2021, US Capitol riot.  
  

Fresh January 6 convictions raise the stakes for Trump 


      It’s a common sight to see notes being passed during criminal trials as a way to communicate during what can be lengthy proceedings, but those notes are largely kept out of the public eye.  
  

      CNN reviewed a number of the handwritten notes written by the far-right Proud Boys and their legal teams that spanned the course of the seditious conspiracy trial – one of the highest-profile and most aggressive prosecutions brought by the Justice Department since the Capitol attack. 
  

      The notes passed around the defense table give a rare insight into defendants who appeared anxious about their futures, at times bored with the drawn-out legal fights that plagued the trial, and focused on proving there was no overarching plan to commit sedition. 
  

      The 18-week trial concluded last week with the jury in Washington, DC, convicting four of the five – Enrique Tarrio, Ethan Nordean, Joseph Biggs, Zachary Rehl – of seditious conspiracy. Dominic Pezzola was acquitted of that charge but convicted of others, including obstruction of an official proceeding. Tarrio, Nordean, Biggs, Rehl and Pezzola were accused of being part of a wide-ranging plot to violently oppose Joe Biden from becoming president.  
  

      Pezzola’s attorney Steven Metcalf said in a statement to CNN that “there were a bunch of talented artists on the defense side,” and “this was an exceptionally long trial, with days where even I did not make a record. We had to fill that void with humor and at times laughter.”
  

      Norman Pattis, an attorney for Biggs, told CNN: “You didn’t find the truly funny notes, keep digging.” 
  

      Lawyers for Tarrio, Nordean and Rehl declined to comment on the notes.
  

      In the courtroom, the defendants sat on one side of a large wooden table across from their lawyers. Each had access to legal pads and colored sticky notes, which they wrote on and passed to one another.    
  

      It is not entirely clear which defendant, or lawyer, wrote which note.  
  

      CNN observed defendants and their lawyers passing notes throughout the trial, starting with jury selection.   
  

      On flash cards obtained by CNN written at the time of jury selection, individuals at the defense table had written things like “YES,” “NO” “OH HELL NO” “SPY” and “DON’T CARE.”  
  

      “Steeeeee-Reighck!!” one person wrote, seeming to reference striking someone from sitting on the jury. Underneath, the person wrote – and underlined – the word “Reich.” That note was later torn into several pieces.  
  

      Another parodied one of the questions that Judge Timothy Kelly, who was presiding over the trial, asked prospective jurors – about whether they could be fair and impartial.  
  

      “Question for Judge,” the note says. “Can YOU be fair and impartial?” 
  

      Several of the notes obtained by CNN referred to the testimony that government witnesses gave about the Proud Boys’ movements around the 2020 presidential election.    
  

      Prosecutors alleged that after the election was called for Biden, Donald Trump supporters, including members of the Proud Boys, took to the streets to protest Biden’s win even before January 6.   
  

      In one note, however, someone at the defense table took issue with prosecutors’ characterization of the Proud Boys marches. “Were not roaming the streets because of election,” the note reads.  
  

      Some individuals also took issue with how prosecutors presented social media and chat messages, implying that the Justice Department lawyers overplayed their importance because not everyone on a group chat paid attention to what others were writing there.  
  

      “‘Upvoting’ ‘liking’ ‘hear + reacting’ are all such mindless ‘engagements’ on social media,” someone wrote, referencing different ways a user might interact with a message on social media. “They are reaching so hard.” 
  

      A few notes seemingly strike at anxieties about the government’s case.  
  

      “Your name/picture will be on Boots on Ground,” one note said, referring to the name of an encrypted chat group the Proud Boys used to discuss their plans and movements on January 6. “The gov. said they will have an expert testify that you are on it but we are going to slam them with [evidence] that you aren’t.”  
  

      “So don’t freak out,” the person added.  
  

      That anxiety also carried into days when government cooperators testified. One such cooperator, Matthew Greene, a Proud Boys member from upstate New York, told jurors that he spoke regularly with Pezzola about the group’s activities, testifying “the typical things that had been going on to redress our grievances were ineffective and were not working.”  
  

      In a note on the day of Greene’s testimony, someone at the defense table wrote: “Do you think Greene saying he conspired with me is a big deal even though he said there was no plan and the conspiracy started after the breach?” 
  

      On the day that Proud Boys videographer Eddie Block testified that “Tarrio thought he was too good for me,” one note from the defense table reads: “ask him if im friendly and not confrontational.” The next day, on cross-examination from Tarrio’s lawyer, Block testified that Tarrio was nice to him and treated him fairly.  
  

      Despite sitting through one of the most serious criminal cases related to the January 6 riot, the defense still found levity in the situation and passed notes with detailed comics or jokes about the ongoing trial.     
  

      One doodle showed a cross-eyed man wearing a nametag that says “Noble Lead” – Tarrio’s nickname. The man is saying, “Dos pollos para me Por favor,” which is Spanish for “two chickens for me please.”  
  

      Next to the drawing, someone with different handwriting wrote “Tóuche.”   
  

      Tario, an alleged leader of the group, was accused of conspiracy but wasn’t in Washington on the day of the Capitol attack. It’s unclear what the doodle refers to, though the Proud Boys have adopted the rooster as a symbol.  
  

      They occasionally chastised one another for not taking the proceedings seriously.  
  

      “The jury is looking @ you,” one note stated. “Make sure you always behave.”

18,House Democrat’s bill is latest proposal aimed at alleged judge-shopping in abortion pill case,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/09/politics/judge-shopping-kascmaryk-abortion-pill-bill/index.html,"      House Rep. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey on Tuesday rolled out a bill that would require any civil lawsuit seeking a court order that would apply nationwide be filed in a judicial district where there are two or more active judges assigned to hear cases. It’s the second Democratic legislative proposal in recent weeks to address the trend.
  

      The “forum-shopping” strategy used by litigants – on both the left and the right – to file lawsuits in courtrooms where the case is likely to be assigned to a sympathetic judge is not a new strategy. 
  

      But the practice has escalated in the legal battles over President Joe Biden’s agenda as conservatives have focused on judicial divisions – several of them in Texas – where just one judge hears all or most of the cases filed there. 
  

      The lawsuit brought by anti-abortion doctors to challenge the federal government’s approval of medication abortion drugs is perhaps the most prominent recent example. 
  

      One of the groups behind the case, weeks before their lawsuit was filed, incorporated in Amarillo, Texas, where US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk hears all of the lawsuits filed in that federal court. Kacsmaryk agreed with the plaintiffs and sought to cut off nationwide access to the abortion drug, only to have his order paused by the Supreme Court.
  

      The challengers’ lawyer has denied to CNN that they engaged in judge-shopping. Still, the case prompted Sherrill to draft the judge-shopping legislation. 
  

      “You read his opinion and, and it’s not a very well informed one,” Sherrill told CNN. “So to think that conservatives could drive cases to this one judge, and this one extremist court, doesn’t feel like justice.” 
  

      Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has also apparently embraced the tactic. His office – sometimes joined by Republican attorneys general from other states – has filed at least a half dozen lawsuits in the Amarillo division, which is in a far-flung area of northern Texas far from the state’s capital. Paxton’s office also has funneled much of its litigation against the Biden administration through the Victoria, Texas, division, where Judge Drew Tipton is all but guaranteed to hear the civil cases brought there. 
  

      Kacsmaryk and Tipton are Donald Trump appointees who have now issued several rulings against Biden policies, including in challenges to multiple aspects of the president’s immigration agenda. 
  

      In one such immigration case, where the Justice Department tried unsuccessfully to object to Texas’ choice of venue, a lawyer for Paxton’s office admitted they had purposefully filed the lawsuit in Victoria, Texas, in order to get it in front of Tipton, pointing to the judge’s familiarity with other immigration-related litigation.
  

      According to a February DOJ filing in that case, the Texas attorney general has filed at least 18 lawsuits against the federal government “in Divisions where the case would necessarily be assigned to a single, pre-determined judge.” 
  

       Sherrill’s proposal follows a measure from Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii. That bill, introduced last month, targets the practice by requiring that civil lawsuits seeking nationwide court orders go through the federal district court in Washington, DC. Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin told CNN last month he wanted to take a look at Hirono’s judge-shopping bill. 
  

      “That’s clearly what’s going on in Amarillo, Texas,” said Durbin, an Illinois Democrat.
  

      It’s unclear what kind of traction either measure will get in Congress, with Republicans controlling the House. Nevertheless, the proposals spotlight a source of frustration for the Biden administration and Democrats on Capitol Hill. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote an April 27 letter to the Judge David Godbey – the chief judge of the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas, under which the Amarillo division sits – calling on him to rework the system by which cases are assigned there. 
  

      Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan has also referenced the practice, alluding to it during oral arguments in a Texas lawsuit against a Biden immigration policy last fall, as she grilled a lawyer for Texas on whether the immigration policy was inflicting the kind of harm on the state that warranted judicial intervention. 
  

      She noted that “in Texas, there are divisions within districts. You can pick your trial court judge.” 
  

      “You know, you play by the rules, that’s fine, but you pick your trial court judge,” Kagan added. The case, which was originally filed in the Victoria division, has not yet been decided by the Supreme Court.
  

      The Justice Department has tried to push back against the strategy in court, by filing requests to move some of the lawsuits brought by Texas against Biden policies out of courthouses where just one or two judges hear all of the cases. 
  

      Kacsmaryk and Tipton both rejected such requests. A third judge, US District Judge James Wesley Hendrix – who hears two-thirds of lawsuits filed in Lubbock, Texas – is still weighing a DOJ bid to move a lawsuit challenging last year’s federal appropriations bill to either the federal court in Washington or in Austin.

      Jean-Pierre touted “deep historical and people-to-people ties” between the US and Pacific Island countries.
  

      Biden will meet with Papua New Guinea Prime Minister James Marape and other Pacific Island Forum leaders, Jean-Pierre said.
  

      She continued, “The leaders will discuss ways to deepen cooperation on challenges critical to the region and to the United States such as combating climate change, protecting maritime resources, and advancing resilient and inclusive economic growth.”
  

      The Papua New Guinea trip comes as the US is seeking to strengthen partnerships in the region as a counter to China’s rising influence. The Biden administration has worked to deepen its engagement with Pacific Island nations, including the announcements of new embassies in the Solomon Islands, Kiribati and Vanuatu.
  

      Biden is set to attend the G7 Leaders’ Summit in Hiroshima, Japan, May 19-21, and will later attend the Quad Leaders’ Summit in Sydney, Australia, on May 24, where he will be joined by heads of state from Australia, Japan and India.

      First reported by The Associated Press, the package will fall under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI), which means it will be contracted and purchased from manufacturers instead of pulled directly from Defense Department stocks in a drawdown. Instead of supplying Ukraine with the weapons it currently needs, USAI packages are intended to create a medium- and long-term supply for Ukraine.
  

      With the new package announcement, the US has committed $37.6 billion in military aid to Ukraine since the beginning of the Biden administration, including $36.9 billion since the beginning of the war in February 2022.
  

      Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said in late April that the Ukrainian military is almost finished preparing for its counteroffensive against Russian forces. When it launches, it will mark a significant shift in the conflict. 
  

      Modern Western tanks, including German Leopard 2 tanks and British Challenger 2 tanks, have arrived in Ukraine, along with other armored vehicles like American Bradley and Stryker vehicles. 
  

US to begin training Ukrainian forces on Abrams tanks next month


      NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said two weeks ago that 98% of the combat vehicles promised to Ukraine have been delivered, a total of more than 1,500 vehicles and 230 tanks. 
  

      Ukrainian officials have been quiet about when exactly they will launch their anticipated spring offensive or what areas they will target. Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, said last week they will not openly signal to Russia when the offensive will begin, though he did acknowledge that weather had delayed the military’s plans.
  

      But even after the Ukrainian counteroffensive begins, the US will continue to send military aid to Ukraine, according to a US military official, both to sustain Ukraine’s military force against dug-in Russian troops and to provide new equipment. For example, the US has not yet provided Ukrainian forces training on M1A1 Abrams tanks, a powerful weapon that will offer Kyiv with another potent military option but will take several months of training. 
  

      To date, nearly 10,000 Ukrainian troops have completed different forms of training with the US, the official said, including advanced maneuver training and programs specific to individual weapon systems.

The second source said Nides has begun telling members of the Israeli government that he will be leaving this summer. 
  

      CNN has reached out to the State Department for comment. 
  

      News of Nides’ planned departure comes at a time when the US-Israel relationship has been tense following Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s attempts to pass controversial plans to overhaul the country’s judiciary. The White House signaled its displeasure with Netanyahu’s coalition government, which includes far-right members, by withholding an invitation for Oval Office talks following his return to power. 
  

      Axios first reported that Nides is expected to depart the post.

22,"What is Title 42, why is it ending and what’s happening now at the border?",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/09/politics/title-42-ending-whats-next-explainer-cec/index.html,"      Title 42, the Trump-era pandemic public health restrictions that became a key tool officials used to turn back migrants at the US-Mexico border, is set to expire on May 11.


      Here are answers to some key questions about Title 42, what’s happening on the ground and what could happen next.
  

      In the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a public health order that officials said aimed to stop the spread of Covid-19. The order allowed authorities to swiftly expel migrants at US land borders. The policy is widely known as Title 42, for the portion of US code that allowed the CDC director to issue it.
  

Why the US expects a border surge and is deploying troops


      Migrants encountered under Title 42 have been either returned to their home countries or sent back into Mexico. Under the policy, authorities have expelled migrants at the US-Mexico border more than 2.8 million times since the policy began, according to US Customs and Border Protection data. 
  

      The policy, which officials have relied on to manage a spiraling situation at the border, is set to end at 11:59 p.m. ET on Thursday. 
  

      We’ve known for months that Title 42’s days were numbered. 
  

      The policy’s end comes as the Biden administration is ending the Covid public health emergency nationally.
  

      The emergency declaration was the legal underpinning for Title 42’s border restrictions, in addition to a number of other policies.
  

      Officials predict that lifting Title 42 is likely to spur a significant increase in the number of migrants trying to cross into the US.
  

      One reason for the expected spike: Many migrants who were sent back to Mexico under the policy are desperate and losing patience. 
  

More than 100 migrants found aboard train near US-Mexico border, days before Covid-era border policy expires 


      Advocates say for many of those who were expelled under Title 42, the situation has been dire.
  

      Since Biden took office, Human Rights First says it’s identified more than 13,000 incidents of kidnapping, torture, rape or other violent attacks on people blocked or expelled to Mexico under Title 42.
  

      Another reason for an expected surge in migrant crossings, according to officials, is misinformation from smugglers who exploit migrants for financial gain.
  

      Speaking to reporters last week, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas urged would-be migrants not to fall victim to those efforts.
  

      “You are being deceived, and you are risking your lives and your life savings, only to meet a consequence that you do not expect at our southern border,” he said.
  

      “The border is not open, it has not been open, and it will not be open subsequent to May 11,” he said.
  

      Without Title 42 in place, US immigration authorities will return to decades-old protocols at a time of unprecedented mass migration in the Western hemisphere.
  

      Under that system, migrants are either removed from the country, detained or released into the US while their cases make their way through immigration court.
  

      But the Biden administration is also planning several changes that authorities hope will relieve pressure on the border and help officials respond.
  

Plans set in motion as Biden administration eyes end of Covid-era border restriction


      The Department of Homeland Security previously released a six-pillar plan that outlined the department’s operations post-Title 42, including setting up additional facilities along the border to process migrants, bolstering transportation and leaning on a fast-track deportation process known as “expedited removal.” Administration officials are still relying on that plan.
  

      In addition, a new regulation expected to go into effect this week would largely ban migrants who traveled through other countries on their way to the US-Mexico border from applying for asylum in the United States.  
  

      While there are some exceptions, the new asylum rule would generally apply to migrants who unlawfully cross the US-Mexico border. It would not apply to unaccompanied migrant children. 
  

      The planned asylum restrictions have drawn sharp criticism from immigrant rights advocates since they were proposed earlier this year and are likely to face legal challenges.
  

      The administration is also sending an additional 1,500 active-duty troops to the border and leaning on Mexico to help stem migration in part by allowing the US to send certain migrants who aren’t Mexican back across the border..
  

      “We’ve been preparing for quite some time, and we are ready,” Mayorkas said last week, but he also acknowledged that large numbers of migrants are expected at the border.
  

      Politicians on both sides of the aisle and local officials have expressed skepticism that the administration truly is prepared to handle the crisis. Already the number of migrants crossing the border appears to be on the rise, and detention facilities have reached capacity.
  

      In a news conference Monday morning, Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott likened the expiration of Title 42 as the laying out of a welcome mat to migrants across the world, signaling America’s borders are wide open.
  

      “It will lead to an incredible amount of people coming across the border illegally,” Abbott said, adding the administration’s policies would “cause a catastrophic disaster.”
  

      The Title 42 border restrictions were controversial from the moment the Trump administration announced them. Immigrant rights advocates argued officials were using public health as a pretext to keep as many immigrants out of the country as possible. Public health experts also slammed the policy, saying it wasn’t justified by the circumstances.
  

      And last year a federal judge sided with them, calling the policy “arbitrary and capricious.” 
  

      Republican-led states launched a round of legal challenges after the Biden administration first announced plans to end the policy. And the Supreme Court had said it would weigh in after an emergency appeal.
  

      But US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar argued that case was rendered moot once the administration announced its plans to end the Covid public health emergency. And soon afterward, the Supreme Court removed the case from its calendar.
  

      Some communities are already dealing with an influx of migrants.
  

      Brownsville, Texas, began seeing a spike about a week and a half ago, according to Sergio Cordova, a founder of the non-profit organization Team Brownsville.
  

Southern border braces for a migrant surge with Title 42 set to expire this week


      The organization has been receiving about 1,000 migrants a day at its center, Cordova said. And while many quickly move on to their next destinations, dozens have slept on the streets over the last week.
  

      El Paso, which declared a state of emergency ahead of Title 42’s expiration, already has about 2,300 migrants living on the streets around two shelters downtown, and some aid organizations worry they won’t have the resources to help everyone if that number grows.
  

      “We’re still able to feed them, but in all honesty, that’s not (a) sustainable operation at this point,” John Martin, deputy director of the Opportunity Center for the Homeless in El Paso, Texas, told CNN on Sunday.
  

      “This is a national issue,” Martin said. “We in El Paso, along with many other communities along the southern border, just happened to be at the front doorstep.”
  

      Concern over Title 42’s end isn’t limited to border states. The issue has become a lightning rod nationally, particularly in cities that have in recent months become the targets for Republican governors and officials in Southern states sending buses of migrants elsewhere.
  

New York City mayor announces plan to transport willing migrants to locations outside the city ahead of expected surge


      New York Mayor Eric Adams has been vocal in his calls for more aid, saying the migrant arrivals in his city and others in the Northeast should be handled by the federal government. The financial burden, he said recently, is also taking a toll on the city, which on Friday was awarded $30.5 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency in humanitarian aid – a fraction of the $350 million the city asked for.
  

      With the 2024 presidential election looming, whatever happens next at the border is sure to face intense scrutiny on the national political stage.
  

      Already lawmakers in Washington are sparring over how to respond.

23,"Debt default could occur in early June, forecasters say, backing Yellen",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/09/politics/debt-ceiling-default-early-june/index.html,"      The projections, which are roughly in line with those issued last week by Yellen and the Congressional Budget Office, add to the pressure on House Republicans and President Joe Biden, who may have only a few weeks to hammer out their vast differences over addressing the debt ceiling. Biden is meeting with congressional leaders Tuesday to work on a deal, the first movement in months.
  

      A weaker-than-expected tax season, spurred in part by disaster-related filing extensions for much of California and parts of Alabama and Georgia, has increased the odds that Treasury won’t have enough funds to pay the federal government’s bills in early June, according to an updated estimate released Tuesday by the Bipartisan Policy Center. 
  

      “The coming weeks are critical for assessing the strength of government cash flows,” said Shai Akabas, the center’s director of economic policy. “If a solution is not reached before June, policymakers may be playing daily Russian roulette with the full faith and credit of the United States, risking financial disaster for their constituents and the country.”
  

      The so-called X-date, when the US could default, could arrive between early June and early August, according to the center. In February, it projected the default could take place during the summer or early fall.
  

      Meanwhile, Moody’s Analytics last week pegged the default date at June 8, significantly earlier than its prior projection of August 18. But the X-date could hit as soon as June 1 or as late as early August, according to that analysis.
  

      Cumulative income tax receipts are tracking more than 30% below collections a year ago, in part because of weaker capital gains revenue as a result of last year’s stock market declines, Moody’s said.
  
Interactive: The $31.4 trillion debt dilemma

      Tax receipts are running $150 billion below government projections for fiscal year 2023, which began in October, according to a report issued Monday by the Penn Wharton Budget Model, an independent research organization. This is due mainly to a drop in capital gains income and weakening corporate profit margins.
  

      In Yellen’s letter to House Speaker Kevin McCarthy last week, she said the exact date of default is impossible to pinpoint since the amount of revenue the federal government collects and the amount it spends is variable. She noted it could come as early as June 1 but could be a number of weeks later.
  

      Even if the Treasury Department doesn’t completely run out of funds, it could be difficult for the agency to manage its payments and stay below the debt ceiling when it only has a tiny cash balance, Akabas said. How much revenue the agency collects in the next three weeks is critical to whether the nation will default next month.
  

      “Treasury is skating on very thin ice in the month of June. If it’s $10, $20, $30, $40 billion below what we anticipate, that means that they’re really going to be in a crunch situation,” he said of revenue.
  

      Unable to keep borrowing to pay the nation’s obligations, the Treasury Department has been using cash and “extraordinary measures” to avoid default since the US hit its $31.4 trillion debt ceiling in January.
  

      If government collections wind up being enough to keep Treasury’s coffers flush through early June, then it’s likely the government won’t default until later in the summer. The agency will get another injection of funds from second quarter estimated tax payments, which are due June 15, and from an extraordinary measure that becomes available at the end of that month.
  

      Investors are growing skittish about the debt ceiling impasse and a potential default.
  

      Last week, the Treasury Department sold $50 billion of four-week securities scheduled to mature on June 6 at a record 5.84%, the highest yield for any Treasury Department bill auction since 2000, Akabas noted.
  

      “Even now, the looming deadline is raising costs to the government and therefore, to all taxpayers,” he said.
  

      If the government was to default for the first time, it would trigger an economic meltdown in the US and send shock waves through the global financial system. 
  

      If the default lasts for about a week, then close to 1 million jobs would be lost, including in the financial sector, which would be hard hit by the stock market declines, according to Moody’s. Also, the unemployment rate would jump to about 5% and the economy would contract by nearly half a percent.
  

      But if the impasse dragged on for six weeks, then more than 7 million jobs would be lost, the unemployment rate would soar above 8% and the economy would decline by more than 4%, according to Moody’s. The effects would still be felt a decade from now.

24,Biden calls for ‘fair deal’ for writers as strike continues,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/08/politics/biden-writers-strike/index.html,"      The president made the comments while honoring Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Heritage Month at the White House with a star-studded screening of “American Born Chinese,” a show set to premiere later this month.
  

      “Nights like these are a reminder of the power of stories, and the importance of treating storytellers with dignity, respect and the value they deserve,” Biden said. “I sincerely hope the writer strike in Hollywood gets resolved and the writers are given a fair deal they deserve as soon as possible.”
  

      He called the Hollywood film industry “iconic,” and “meaningful,” adding that “we need the writers, and all the workers, and everyone involved to tell the stories of our nation and the stories of all of us.”
  

TV and film writers are fighting to save their jobs from AI. They won't be the last


      More than 11,000 members of the Writers Guild of America went on strike May 2 for the first time since 2007, demanding better compensation and other concessions from studios and streamers amid a changing media landscape.
  

      Writers say a pivot by the industry to focus on streaming has left even successful, award-winning writers unable to make a living in a business with fewer job opportunities and diminished pay.

      The WGA has signaled that the work stoppage could last for many months, CNN has reported, while studio executives have insisted their bank of streaming content can withstand writers temporarily stopping the flood of content.
  

      The president at Monday’s event was introduced by Academy Award winner Ke Huy Quan, who stars in the Disney+ streaming show based on the graphic novel of the same name. 
  

      “When I think about this story, I think about the courage it took for so many of you and your ancestors to start the journey to America and continue the traditions,” Biden said, speaking in the East Room. “I’m determined to remind everyone, and we’re doing it again tonight, that our strength lies in our diversity.”

29,McCarthy-Biden showdown is about much more than the US national debt,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/09/politics/mccarthy-biden-showdown-national-debt/index.html,"      While the gravest human impact of a default would be felt by millions of Americans in lost jobs, benefits and an eroded sense of economic security, the showdown is also about power.
  

      The huge stakes explain why a meeting between Biden, McCarthy and other top congressional leaders in the Oval Office on Tuesday is so critical and will be watched worldwide.
  

If US defaults on its debt, Treasury would have to decide how to pay the bills


      It represents a fateful moment in the apparently tense and shallow relationship between the two most powerful people in Washington and will help define a period of bitterly divided government in the capital. Can a Democratic president and a Republican who leads what’s perhaps the most radical House majority ever navigate a solution that satisfies both their incompatible political positions? Or is this disconnect destined to deeply harm the country?
  

      The consequences of a default on US debt – which could happen as soon as June 1 if Congress doesn’t agree to lift the government’s borrowing authority – would be disastrous. The government would have to choose which bills to pay – for instance, between the interest on the national debt or the benefits on which millions of Americans rely. Markets could plunge, a recession could occur and unemployment could rocket. A default would permanently raise US borrowing rates. 
  

      “We just wouldn’t have enough money to pay the bills. And I think it’s widely agreed that this would be a huge hit to the economy and really an economic catastrophe,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told CNBC on Monday.
  

      And a source familiar with the matter told CNN’s Matt Egan Monday night that Yellen has been making calls to CEOs and business leaders to discuss the consequences of brinkmanship around the debt ceiling.
  

      Yet it’s this very threat of catastrophe that makes the debt ceiling showdown such an effective tool of political leverage. Both sides in the standoff appear to believe that the other will blink to avoid the appalling consequences of going over the edge of a cliff. But worryingly, each party seems convinced the other will cave to avoid blame.
  

      In exchange for raising the debt ceiling, McCarthy – under pressure from a conference packed with extremists and fiscal conservatives – is demanding massive budget cuts to curtail government spending that would effectively crater Biden’s agenda on issues like climate change. 
  

      Biden argues that the MAGA Republicans – a phrase he uses to attach them to the extremism of ex-President Donald Trump – are holding the economy hostage by refusing to raise the debt limit promptly. He rightly points out they didn’t balk at doing so under his predecessor. He’s ready to discuss government spending but in a regular budget process, not linked to the US obligation to pay debts incurred by previous administrations and approved by Congress.
  

5 ways a debt default could affect you


      Heading into Tuesday’s meeting, which also includes Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, there is no sign that either side is willing to bend with time running out ahead of the early June date that Yellen has warned about for default.  
  

      “There’s no plan B,” Bharat Ramamurti, the deputy director of the National Economic Council, told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Monday.
  

      There are at least three potential outcomes of the kind of meeting involving McCarthy and Biden. In some ways, the president’s invitation and the speaker’s acceptance look like a choreographed attempt by each to blame the other for intransigence. The theater on the president’s home turf may send a message that Biden is reasonable while McCarthy is extreme. But if there is no progress, the speaker will likely accuse the president of being stubborn.
  

      Biden is determined to hold the line on demanding a clean debt ceiling increase, White House officials say, and the president’s goal is to move spending negotiations onto a separate track – removing the threat of default while giving the GOP assurances he will engage in good-faith negotiations about federal spending.
  

      The chance of a breakthrough is slim. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre made clear Monday that the purpose of the meeting was not “debt ceiling negotiations” but a wider spending conversation that McCarthy is not ready to have.
  

      An obvious breakdown of the talks could spook the markets and paradoxically add to political pressure for Biden and McCarthy to find a compromise. A sign that they are willing to talk again could fuel speculation that Congress could pass a short-term debt ceiling increase to defer the crisis to a later date and give the two sides time to work a way out of the mess.
  

      A president has personal goals and political requirements but also assumes a greater responsibility for the wellbeing of the country. True political leadership comes at the intersection of these two often conflicting impulses. Biden may face such a situation now. A debt default and its consequences could be disastrous for his recently announced reelection campaign and add to challenges, ranging from a border crisis to concerns about his age, that are complicating his political future.
  

      But conceding to McCarthy would make him look weak – a corrosive image for any president – and would suggest that House Republicans can browbeat him for the rest of his term.
  

      Biden’s trouble stirring enthusiasm from Democratic voters, revealed in multiple polls, means he can’t afford to show he is dominated by McCarthy. In the past, a domestic battle that allows a Democratic president to portray Republicans as extremists ready to wreck the economy for partisan gain has been a powerful galvanizing force.
  

43 Senate Republicans vow to oppose debt ceiling increase without spending cuts


      So for reasons of governance and politics, Biden has every incentive to stand firm, even as tensions and anxiety over a possible debt default mount. He doesn’t have the numbers in Congress to force Republicans to bend. And he’s sticking to his line that only Congress has the capacity to raise the debt ceiling and that if it fails to do so, Republicans standing in the way will be to blame for a massive self-inflicted national disaster.
  

      “This is a crisis that is being entirely provoked by House Republicans who have the ability tomorrow to put a bill on the floor that would raise the debt limit without conditions,” Ramamurti said, adding that at that point Biden would be happy discuss tax and spending policy.
  

      McCarthy’s position may be even more politically dicey than Biden’s. One factor that makes the situation so potentially dangerous is the narrowness of the Republican majority that he leads. Paradoxically, voters who worried about handing the GOP a big win in November because of pro-Trump extremism may have inadvertently driven the majority further right. 
  

      That’s because radicalized Republican lawmakers now have the capacity to hold McCarthy to ransom and to extract big concessions. This dynamic played out in the 15 rounds it took the Californian to win the speakership in January and last month when the House passed a plan to raise the debt ceiling in return for huge spending cuts. The plan, which passed by just one vote, will not be taken up in the Democratic-led Senate and has been rejected by Biden. 
  

      Still, as narrow as it might be, McCarthy does have a mandate to seek to implement the wishes of millions of Republican voters who want to see a slowdown in spending – even if the GOP’s fiscal discipline does only seem to kick in when a Democrat is the White House.
  

      “The House Republican majority was elected to serve as a check and balance in large part because of the reckless spending engaged in by the Biden administration,” New York Rep. Mike Lawler, who flipped a Democratic seat in the midterms, told CNN on Monday.
  

      The New York Republican will be directly targeted by Biden on Wednesday when the president travels to his district as part of an apparent plan to pressure more moderate Republicans on the debt ceiling. Lawler urged the White House to use the just-passed GOP bill as a starting point.
  

      “The president and Senate majority obviously do not like it. That’s their prerogative. That’s their right. But we are split government. So we need to all work together, come to the table and have an honest dialogue.”
  

      Lawler’s comment raises the question of whether Biden’s position is incompatible with the reality of divided power in Washington and may not be sustainable in the long term.
  

      In more normal political times, it would not be hard to see a scenario where Biden – a fabled deal maker in half a century of Washington life – and the speaker could offer one another sufficient concessions for each to save face and for disaster to be avoided. A classic Washington fudge might see Biden able to claim he had secured a debt ceiling hike without concessions, while in a companion budget deal McCarthy could say he halted Democratic spending sprees. But this is a long way away in a polarized capital.
  

      And even if they could do a deal, the most daunting aspect of the crisis remains. McCarthy, who can only afford to lose four votes, may not be able to get his wild and tiny House majority to agree. And if he tried to use Democratic votes to get a bill over the line, he’d probably lose his job.
  

      So the prospects that Tuesday’s meeting will yield a breakthrough are not promising.

31,"Exclusive: Nearly 610,000 public sector workers got student loan forgiveness after Biden loosened the rules",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/08/politics/public-service-loan-forgiveness-biden-waiver/index.html,"      The program promises to wipe away remaining federal student loan debt after an eligible government or nonprofit worker makes 10 years of monthly payments.
  

      Another 6,000 borrowers in the program will see their loans discharged soon. Altogether, those cancellations will total $42 billion of federal student debt, the Department of Education said Monday. 
  

Have you received student debt forgiveness since Biden took office in 2021? Tell us


      Just 7,000 borrowers had been approved for relief under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program during the Trump administration, according to the department. 
  

      The targeted debt relief program was created in 2007 but was riddled with problems, and a very small percentage of people who applied had received forgiveness before 2021, prompting the Biden administration to make changes. 
  

      “Since Day One, the Biden-Harris Administration has worked relentlessly to fix a broken student loan system, including by making sure we fulfill the promise of Public Service Loan Forgiveness for those who have spent a decade or more serving our communities and our country,” Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said in a statement.
  

      “The difference that Public Service Loan Forgiveness is making in the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans reminds us why we must continue doing everything we can to fight for borrowers and why families cannot afford to have progress derailed by partisan politicians,” he said.
  

      The administration’s separate, one-time student loan forgiveness program is currently held up in court after several Republican-led states sued, arguing the executive branch does not have the power to implement the proposed debt relief.
  

      In October 2021, the Biden administration created a one-year waiver that expanded eligibility for the PSLF program. 
  

      Previously, eligibility hinged on having a federal Direct Loan and being enrolled in an income-driven repayment plan, which sets payments based on income and family size. Those with Federal Family Education Loans, which were made by private lenders but backed by the government, did not qualify.
  

      But under the temporary waiver, it no longer mattered what kind of federal student loans borrowers have or what repayment plans they were enrolled in. All payments were eligible for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program if the borrower was working full time for a qualifying employer.
  

      The waiver ended after October 2022, though some applications filed under the waiver are still being processed. 
  

      The department is making some other changes to the PSLF program to make it easier for borrowers to apply. 
  

      The newly updated PSLF Help Tool now allows borrowers to sign and submit their PSLF form digitally and track its status throughout the process, the Department of Education said Monday. 
  

      Previously, borrowers had to take multiple steps to submit their PSLF form. In most cases, they had to print and sign their form, obtain signatures on the printed form from one or more employers, and then submit the completed form and related documents – sometimes by mail or fax. 
  

      Now, borrowers can complete the entire process digitally on StudentAid.gov via the PSLF Help Tool, including requesting an e-signature from employers. 
  

      “The improved PSLF Help Tool is another step forward to modernize and simplify the process for people who rely on us to carry out the law effectively,” Federal Student Aid Chief Operating Officer Richard Cordray said in a statement.
  

      The Biden administration is making some permanent changes to the PSLF program, which are set to take effect in July. 
  

      The changes will allow borrowers to receive credit toward PSLF on payments that are made late, in installments or in a lump sum. Prior rules only counted a payment as eligible if it was made in full within 15 days of its due date.
  

      Under the new rules, time spent in certain periods of deferment or forbearance will count toward PSLF. These periods include deferments for cancer treatment, military service, economic hardship and time served in AmeriCorps and the National Guard.
  

      The new rules will also simplify the criteria to meet the requirement that a borrower be a full-time employee in a public sector job. The new standard will consider full-time employment at 30 hours a week. In particular, the change will help adjunct faculty at public colleges qualify for the program.
  

      Under the revised regulations, borrowers will receive some credit for past payments when they consolidate older loans into federal Direct Loans in order to qualify for the program. Previously, borrowers lost all progress toward forgiveness when they consolidated. After July, they will receive a weighted average of existing qualifying payments toward PSLF.
  

      President Joe Biden’s separate, one-time student debt forgiveness program, which promises up to $20,000 of debt relief for some low- and middle-income borrowers, is currently blocked by federal courts. 
  

      The Supreme Court is expected to issue its decision in the case over whether the program is constitutional in late June or early July. 
  

      But the Biden administration has also streamlined student debt relief for people who were defrauded by for-profit colleges as well as borrowers who are permanently disabled. 
  

      In total, the administration has approved more than $66 billion in loan relief to nearly 2.2 million borrowers to date, according to the Department of Education. 
  

      Meanwhile, payments on most federal student loans have been paused since March 2020 due to a pandemic-related relief effort. That pause is expected to end later this year.

32,Biden administration will propose rule requiring airlines to compensate passengers for canceled or delayed flights,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/08/politics/biden-buttigieg-airline-compensation-rule/index.html,"      “When an airline causes a flight cancellation or delay, passengers should not foot the bill,” Buttigieg said in a statement. “This rule would, for the first time in US history, propose to require airlines to compensate passengers and cover expenses such as meals, hotels, and rebooking in cases where the airline has caused a cancellation or significant delay.”
  

      Biden and Buttigieg will also announce that the department is launching an expanded Airline Customer Service Dashboard at FlightRights.gov, which shows which airlines “offer cash compensation, provide travel credits or vouchers, or award frequent flyer miles and cover the costs for other amenities,” according to the official. 
  

      No airlines currently provide cash compensation for preventable cancellations or delays, just one airline company guarantees frequent flyer miles, and two provide travel credits and vouchers, according to the official. Mandates for such compensation policies already exist in Canada and the European Union, the official added.
  

      The proposed rule would also establish what constitutes a “controllable cancellation or delay.”
  

      The proposal from the Biden administration comes as Buttigieg fends off criticism over a chain of flight cancellations at the end of last year and beginning of this year, as well as what Buttigieg himself has called an “uptick in serious close calls” between planes landing and taking off. 
  

      Amid last summer’s flight cancellations, Buttigieg called CEOs of the 10 largest airline companies and pressed them on stress testing their schedule and improving customer service. He put pressure on the CEOs in a letter, saying he would publish charts showing which airlines guaranteed which forms of compensation for canceled or delayed flights. Seven of those airlines – including Southwest – changed their policies before they were posted, and two followed suit soon after. 
  

      Ten airlines now guarantee meals, with nine guaranteeing hotel accommodations, when a delay or cancellation is the airlines, fault, according to the DOT.

33,A weekend of tragedy in Texas spotlights two distinctly American political fissures,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/08/politics/gun-immigration-politics-texas/index.html,"      Horrific eye-witness testimony is emerging from the scene at an outlet mall in affluent Allen, Texas, where on Saturday afternoon a gunman armed with an AR-15-style rifle sprayed shoppers with bullets, killing eight people. It was the latest in a string of mass shootings in Texas and across the country that have killed many innocent people but have brought no action to end the cycle of loss.
  

      Then, on Sunday, a driver slammed into a group of migrants waiting at a bus stop outside a shelter in the Texas border town of Brownsville. At least eight people were killed and close to a dozen injured. It was not clear whether the incident was an accident or intentional. In either case, the tragedy focused fresh attention on the plight of migrants and the controversy over their future.
  

      The tragedies were unrelated. But both moments of aching sorrow took place against a backdrop of two of the nation’s most divisive issues, both of which are especially acute in Texas and which fractured national politics has failed to fix – mass shootings and a border crisis.
  

Texas mall massacre gunman identified as witnesses describe horror of the shooting spree that killed 8 people


      Suspicion of government runs hot in the Lone Star State. But it’s also an epicenter of an emerging political struggle between deeply conservative Republican leaders drawing power from rural areas and more liberal cities. It often appears to exemplify the extremes of American life. It has also had the misfortune of suffering a sequence of shootings, including in a school in Uvalde last year, a Walmart shopping center in El Paso in 2019 and a church in Sutherland Springs in 2017. Just last week, Texans were shocked by a mass shooting by a gunman who killed five people in Cleveland, which started when neighbors complained about a man firing a weapon in his yard.
  

      Texas is also expected to be at the center of a different political storm this week with the expiration on Thursday of the Covid-era border restriction that has enabled the US to swiftly expel certain migrants. The anticipated end of the policy, which has been the primary border enforcement tool since March 2020, has already led to an influx of migrants, with fears about a surge after it’s lifted. Republican warnings of a foreign invasion by undocumented migrants have deepened a political vulnerability for President Joe Biden as the administration has struggled to counter claims of a border crisis. 
  

      But as in the case of mass shootings, there is little chance that the nation’s polarized politics will ease in order to offer the space for meaningful resolution. Comprehensive immigration reform failed several times under Republican and Democratic presidents and there is little agreement between or within the parties on how to mitigate the situation at a time when crime, violence and economic blight are exacerbating migrant flows from Central America toward the southern border.
  

      The weekend put a spotlight on Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has been criticized for mentioning the undocumented status of some victims of the Cleveland massacre, as well as his blessing for loosening lax gun laws. The Republican governor has also played a key role in politicizing the debate over migration, including by shipping migrants to liberal areas.
  

      Abbott told Fox on Sunday that he was heading to Allen to offer condolences to bereaved families and posed a series of questions he said families wanted answered: “Why did this happen? Why did the gunman do this? How did this happen?” 
  

      Rather than considering the availability of guns, he appeared to suggest that some kind of deficiency in the national spirit amid increasing “anger and violence” might be to blame. “We have got to find a way in this country where we can once again reunite Americans … and come together as one big family,” Abbott said. “And in that regard, find ways to reduce violence in our country.” 
  

      But Democrats in Texas reacted to Saturday’s shooting by slamming Abbott for doing nothing to stop the killing sprees on his watch. State Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer warned in a statement that it was “a choice to allow this nightmare of gun violence to continue.”
  

      “An elementary school. A military base. A college. A theater. A church. A Walmart. A high school. And now a shopping outlet. House Democrats grieve today. We grieve for those families who lost loved ones in Allen, but we also grieve for all of our children that have to live in a state where they constantly live under the fear of being shot and killed.”
  

      Biden also noted that the killer in Allen used the kind of AR-15-style weapon that he would like to see outlawed. “We need more action, faster, to save lives,” Biden wrote on Twitter.
  

      Democratic state Sen. Roland Guttierrez, who represents Uvalde, told CNN that “our state is burning down because we have these guns in the hands of people that shouldn’t have them.”
  

      But several Republicans, including Abbott, sought to use the proliferation of mass shootings to argue they were as much of a problem in Democratic states, where gun laws are often more strict, as in conservative ones were state legislatures are working to weaken firearms laws.
  

      US Rep. Henry Cuellar, one of the most conservative Democrats in Congress, told Fox that “people talk about just making the laws stricter. In states that are blue, very strict laws, you still get this type of mass shooting, so it does happen across the nation and we have to get to the bottom of this.” 
  

      There have been mass shootings in Democratic-run states like Michigan and California. Still, a study published last year by Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit organization that focuses on gun violence prevention, found a direct correlation between states with weaker gun laws and higher rates of gun deaths, including homicides, suicides and accidental killings.
  

      The latest mass shooting in Texas came after a spree of such killings in schools, supermarkets, at community parades, a bank and places of worship nationwide. It happened with the country still processing a shooting at a medical facility in Atlanta last week that killed one woman and injured four others. There have been 200 mass shootings in the US so far this year just within the first five months of this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which, like CNN, defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more people are shot, excluding the shooter.
  

      In the incident in Brownsville, which is close to the Rio Grande, police responded to a call around 8:30 am CT about a Land Rover that hit multiple people at a bus stop across the street from the Bishop Enrique San Pedro Ozanam Center, a nonprofit homeless shelter that has been helping house migrants.
  

      Details were still being assembled late on Sunday night. The driver, identified as a Hispanic man, is being “uncooperative” with authorities, according to officials, and had given multiple names. Witnesses described seeing the driver ignore a red light, drive up on a curb and run over a group of people waiting at the bus stop. The shelter has been housing immigrants while they wait for more permanent housing.
  

      But even though investigators are still unsure whether the crash was deliberate, one Democrat accused Republicans of fostering an environment that made migrants vulnerable.
  

      “While the incident is still under investigation, there is no doubt that our state’s leaders are painting a target on migrants’ backs,” said Texas Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa.
  

      New controversy over migrants in Texas comes with the White House under heavy criticism from Republicans over border issues – an issue that has long caused political headaches for Biden, who just launched his 2024 reelection race. 
  

      The expiration of Title 42 will mean that border authorities will have to return to decades-old protocols at a time of unprecedented mass migration in the Western hemisphere. The consequences are likely to further strain the already brittle relationship between the Biden White House and the Abbott administration in Austin, which leaves little hope for cooperation between them.

34,House Republicans to vote Thursday on border security package as Title 42 ends,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/07/politics/title-42-border-security-package-vote/index.html,"      The bill, known as HR 2, would codify some of the border programs implemented by former President Donald Trump, including the “Remain in Mexico” policy, which mandated that migrants stay in Mexico while going through the asylum process. It also would pour more resources into security at the southern border, restart bosrder wall construction, add more border personnel and upgrade border technology, among other provisions. 
  

Why the US expects a border surge and is deploying troops


      Last month, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said Republicans have the necessary votes to pass the legislation in the chamber, despite internal party divisions over how strict certain policies in the legislation should be. 
  

      His comments followed weeks of intraparty negotiations that resulted in the softening of some provisions to get key members, such as Texas Reps. Chip Roy and Tony Gonzalez, and several moderate Republicans on board.
  

      Axios first reported that the vote would be held Thursday. The bill is unlikely to pass in the Democratic-led Senate.
  

      The timing of the vote is designed to directly coincide with the end of Title 42. The policy, first enacted by Trump and continued by President Joe Biden, has allowed border authorities to quickly turn away migrants, citing a public health emergency. 
  

      But on Thursday, when the coronavirus public health emergency ends, authorities will have to return to decades-old protocols at a time of unprecedented mass migration in the Western hemisphere, raising concerns within the administration about a surge in the immediate aftermath of Title 42 lifting. 
  

      Lawmakers in both parties have been sounding the alarm over the expected influx of migrants and have criticized the Biden administration for not being more prepared for the deadline. 
  

      Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, who caucuses with Democrats, introduced a bill last week that would temporarily extend some provisions covered by Title 42 and give the Biden administration more flexibility in how it handles migrants at the border, such as granting the White House a two-year expulsion authority that would apply to migrants trying to enter the US illegally. 
  

Bipartisan team introduces narrow immigration bill ahead of expiration of Covid-era border policy


      But Tillis acknowledged that the bill can’t become law before Title 42 is lifted on Thursday. 
  

      Meanwhile, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Sunday defended the Biden administration’s preparedness and outreach for the lifting of Title 42. 
  

      “It’s going to take our plan a while to really take hold, for people to understand that they can access lawful, safe, orderly pathways before they reach the border,” he told “Face the Nation” on CBS. “And quite frankly, if they come to the border, they will receive a consequence under our enforcement authorities.”
  

      “We are prepared,” Mayorkas said.

35,"Neera Tanden will replace Susan Rice as domestic policy adviser, Biden announces",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/politics/neera-tanden-to-replace-susan-rice/index.html,"      The White House announced last week that Susan Rice would be leaving her post this month, marking one of the Biden administration’s highest-profile departures as the president’s domestic agenda stalls in a divided Congress.
  

      Tanden joined the administration in 2021 as a senior adviser after withdrawing her Cabinet nomination to run the Office of Management and Budget, which failed to garner sufficient support in the Senate.
  

      “For over two years, Susan Rice has helped craft and implement my domestic policy agenda and our country owes a debt of gratitude for her history-making public service,” Biden said in a statement Friday. “I am pleased to announce that Neera Tanden will continue to drive the formulation and implementation of my domestic policy, from economic mobility and racial equity to health care, immigration and education.”
  

      Tanden, the daughter of Indian immigrants, will be the first Asian American to hold the position, he added. 
  

      Biden announced two other personnel promotions Friday. 
  

      Stefanie Feldman will serve as assistant to the president and staff secretary. She currently serves as deputy assistant to the president and senior adviser to the White House domestic policy adviser. 
  

      Zayn Siddique will be promoted to principal deputy of the Domestic Policy Council.

36,Biden to deliver Howard University commencement speech later this month,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/06/politics/biden-howard-commencement-address/index.html,"      The White House confirmed to CNN that Biden will also give the keynote address at the United States Air Force Academy’s commencement in El Paso County, Colorado, on June 1. He disclosed that appearance last month at the White House when he presented the Commander-in-Chief’s Trophy to the Air Force’s football team, the Falcons.
  

      “In a few weeks, I’ll be headed to your home turf for commencement,” the president joked at the time. “You’re going to get stuck with me being your commencement speaker.”
  

      Howard University, Vice President Kamala Harris’ alma mater, has received an ample amount of focus from the Biden administration since the pair took office in 2021. Last month, Harris delivered a fiery speech on abortion rights during a rally on the Howard campus, among other events.
  

Pentagon announces Howard University as the first HBCU to lead university-affiliated research center 


      And in January, Howard University became the first historically Black college or university – also known as an HBCU – to partner with the Department of Defense to lead a university-affiliated research center. Howard will receive $12 million per year for five years to fund research, faculty and students, the Defense Department said in a press release. The center is funded by the DOD and the US Air Force.
  

      Biden’s remarks at the minority-serving institution will come less than a month after he announced his 2024 reelection bid, a campaign that will once again focus heavily on turning out Black voters and young voters to the ballot box.
  

      Securing funding for the more than 100 HBCUs in the US has been a prominent feature of Biden’s domestic agenda. Early on, he proposed nearly $45 billion in funding to fix weathered campuses and help modernize the historic institutions and the communities they serve. So far in his tenure, though, the president has delivered nearly $6 billion worth in HBCU investments through the Department of Education.
  

      Still, HBCUs remain a focus for the Biden administration, a White House official said. The president spoke at the fall commencement at South Carolina State University, an HBCU, in 2021 and delivered a virtual address for HBCU students in June 2021, amid a surge in the Covid-19 pandemic.
  

      And he has also reestablished the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity for HBCUs. Actress and Howard alumna Taraji P. Henson serves on the board.
  

      Other administration officials will fan out to across the country to give commencement speeches at HBCUs, the White House said. They include Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia L. Fudge, who will speak at Florida A&M University in Tallahassee; Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who will speak at Fayetteville State University in North Carolina; and Office of Management and Budget Director Shalanda Young, who will speak at Xavier University of Louisiana in New Orleans.
  

      2016 was the last time a sitting president to spoke at Howard University’s commencement, with President Barack Obama addressing graduates.

37,Missouri lawmakers pass gender-affirming care ban for minors and anti-trans sports bill,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/politics/missouri-transgender-health-care-sports-ban/index.html,"      The state House passed both bills largely along party lines Wednesday, after the state Senate approved them in March. They now head to the desk of Republican Gov. Mike Parson, who has expressed support for the legislation and is expected to sign them.
  

      One of the bills passed, SB49, would limit minors’ access to gender-affirming care, which spans a range of evidence-based treatments and approaches that benefit transgender and nonbinary people. The types of care vary by the age and goals of the recipient, and are considered the standard of care by many mainstream medical associations.
  

      If enacted, the bill would bar health care providers from performing gender transition surgeries, although such surgeries are not typically done on children and many health care providers do not offer them to minors. 
  

      Puberty blockers and hormone treatments for minors would also be banned until August 2027, but the legislation makes an exemption for those who begin receiving treatment before its effective date on August 28, 2023.
  

      This bill follows an emergency rule issued by the state’s Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey last month that put limits on gender-affirming care for minors and adults. The rule has been paused through at least July 20 as a lawsuit plays out. 
  

      Republicans, including the governor, have argued that the bill is about protecting minors from permanent health treatments. 
  

      “All children, regardless of their gender or orientation, are invaluable and should not be subjected to potentially irreversible surgeries and treatments prior to adulthood,” Parson tweeted Wednesday. 
  

      However, opponents slammed the lawmakers who voted in favor of the bill, saying that “erasing trans youth is just the start of the despot tactics” that lawmakers are willing to utilize to target “vulnerable Missourians.” 
  

      “Gender-affirming care saves lives,” said the American Civil Liberties Union chapter of Missouri in a statement. “The Jefferson City politicians’ intentional choice to abuse transgender Missourians will devastate trans people and their families.” The ACLU was one of several advocacy groups that filed a lawsuit against the attorney general’s rule last month. 
  

      Lawmakers on Wednesday also passed SB39, which prohibits public and private schools, including colleges, from allowing students to participate in gendered athletic competitions that do not match their biological sex as listed on a birth certificate or government record, or from competing against a team without such a policy. 
  

      “The presence of biological males in women’s sports limits fair competition for hard-working female athletes,” Parson said in a tweet. “Women & girls fought hard for the equal rights they enjoy today, and they should not be deprived of athletic opportunity due to biological advantages of the opposite sex.” 
  

      However,  a 2017 report  in the journal Sports Medicine that reviewed several related studies found “no direct or consistent research” on trans people having an athletic advantage over their cisgender peers, and critics say this legislation adds to the discrimination that trans people face. 
  

      So far this year, 13 states have placed restrictions on transgender youths’ access to gender-affirming care, including Oklahoma’s care ban earlier this month. According to the ACLU, more than 470 anti-LGBTQ bills have been introduced nationwide this legislative session.

38,Trump again refuses to concede 2020 election while taking questions from New Hampshire GOP primary voters,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/politics/cnn-town-hall-trump/index.html,"      Taking questions from Republican and undeclared voters at the town hall moderated by “CNN This Morning” anchor Kaitlan Collins, Trump remained defiant about his lies about the 2020 election as well as the myriad investigations into him – making clear that he’s sticking to the script he’s delivered over the past two years on conservative media.
  

      The town hall at Saint Anselm College – his first appearance on CNN since 2016 – came as unprecedented legal clouds hang over him as he seeks to become only the second commander in chief ever elected to two nonconsecutive terms. New Hampshire, home to the first-in-the-nation GOP primary, is also home to many swing voters. 
  

      He attacked Tuesday’s jury verdict that found he sexually abused former magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll, whom he mocked while downplaying the significance of the $5 million award to Carroll for battery and defamation.
  

      Trump also would not commit to signing a federal abortion ban and suggested that Republicans should not raise the debt limit and allow the US to default if the Biden White House will not agree to spending cuts. 
  

      The former president said he would pardon “a large portion” of the rioters at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, and even pulled out a printout of his own tweets from that day in an attempt to deflect blame as Collins pressed him on why he waited three hours before telling the rioters to leave the Capitol.
  

      “I am inclined to pardon many of them,” Trump said Wednesday night. 
  

      When Collins pressed Trump on the Manhattan federal jury finding Trump sexually abused Carroll in a luxury department store dressing room in 1996, Trump suggested it was helping his poll numbers. 
  

      When asked if the jury’s decision would deter women from voting for him, the former president said, “No, I don’t think so.”
  

      Trump also took questions from New Hampshire voters on the economy and policy issues, such as abortion. The former president, who solidified the conservative majority on the Supreme Court that struck down Roe v. Wade, repeatedly declined to say whether he would sign a federal abortion ban if he won a second term. 
  

      Trump also suggested Republicans should refuse to raise the debt limit if the White House does not agree to spending cuts.
  

      “I say to the Republicans out there – congressmen, senators – if they don’t give you massive cuts, you’re going to have to do a default, and I don’t believe they’re going to do a default because I think the Democrats will absolutely cave, will absolutely cave because you don’t want to have that happen, but it’s better than what we’re doing right now because we’re spending money like drunken sailors,” Trump said.
  

      When Collins asked him to clarify whether the US should default if the White House doesn’t agree to cuts, Trump said, “We might as well do it now than do it later.”
  

      Trump pleaded not guilty last month to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. Trump also faces potential legal peril in both Washington, DC – where a special counsel is leading a pair of investigations – and in Georgia, where the Fulton County district attorney plans to announce charges this summer from the investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election in the Peach State.
  

      Still, the twice-impeached former president has repeatedly said that any charges will not stop him from running for president, dismissing all of the investigations as politically motivated witch hunts. That’s a view many GOP voters share, according to recent surveys. Nearly 70% of Republican primary voters in a recent NBC News poll said investigations into the former president “are politically motivated” and that “no other candidate is like him, we must support him.”
  

Trump's primary polling advantage is historically large


      While a handful of rivals have entered the Republican presidential primary – and Trump’s biggest potential rival, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, has not yet officially launched a bid – Trump has maintained a healthy lead in early GOP primary polling. In a Washington Post/ABC News poll released Sunday, 43% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents named Trump unprompted when asked who they would like to see the party nominate in 2024, compared with 20% naming DeSantis, and 2% or less naming any other candidate.
  

      Trump’s participation in the town hall is indicative of a broader campaign strategy to try to expand his appeal beyond conservative media viewers, CNN’s Kristen Holmes reported earlier Wednesday. He’s surrounded himself with a more organized team and has been making smaller retail politics stops while scaling back larger rallies – signs of a more traditional campaign than his 2016 and 2020 operations. He lost that 2020 race by about 7 million votes, although he continues to falsely claim it was stolen from him.
  

      There have been warning signs for the GOP that the obsession with the 2020 election isn’t palatable beyond the base. Many of Trump’s handpicked candidates who embraced his election lies in swing states lost in last year’s midterm elections. And his advisers acknowledge he still has work to do to engage with Republican voters outside of his loyal base of supporters, multiple sources told CNN.
  

      This is Trump’s third trip to the Granite State since launching his campaign last fall. Wednesday’s live town hall audience was made up of Republicans and undeclared voters who plan to vote in the GOP primary. Trump handily won the primaries there in 2016 and 2020 before losing the state in both general elections.

39,Biden administration to roll out new tracking measures for migrant families,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/politics/migrant-families-tracking-biden-administration/index.html,"      The so-called Family Expedited Removal Management (FERM) will place certain heads of household for families on an alternative to detention, such as a GPS ankle monitor, and subject them to curfew in four cities, Immigration and Customs Enforcement confirmed in a statement.
  

      The Los Angeles Times first reported on the program.
  

      The families still have the opportunity to claim asylum under the program and if they qualify, go through the asylum process. Families not found to have credible fear are subject to removal under the fast-track deportation process, known as “expedited removal,” which would bar them from the US for five years.
  

      The program is one of many initiatives being rolled out by the Biden administration to try to manage the flow of migrants at the US-Mexico border – in this case, families – following the expiration of a Covid-era border restriction, known as Title 42.  
  

      “[Enforcement and Removal Operations] is committed to imposing immigration consequences in a safe and humane manner to those who unlawfully enter the United States,” said ICE ERO Executive Associate Director Corey Price in a statement.
  

      “Families should not listen to the lies of smugglers. Like single adults, noncitizens travelling with their children who do not have a lawful basis to remain in the United States will be quickly removed and barred from reentry for at least five years,” the statement continued.
  

      Last year, ICE piloted a similar program with migrants who resided in Baltimore and Houston and set a curfew from dusk until dawn.
  

Administration officials have been racing to deal with a significant increase in the number of migrants trying to cross into the US as Title 42 – a pandemic-era rule that has allowed authorities to swiftly expel migrants encountered at the border – is set to expire.
  

      The Biden administration came under fierce criticism earlier this year amid reports that officials were considering restarting family detention, a practice that had been ended by President Joe Biden. Officials have since maintained that there are no plans to return the practice.
  

      But the high number of border arrests in recent days has put the challenge facing the administration into sharp focus.
  

      US border authorities encountered more than 10,000 migrants along the US southern border on Tuesday, according to a Homeland Security official, already surpassing government estimates for the Title 42 aftermath.
  

      Among the new policy measures the administration is putting into place is a new asylum rule that will largely bar migrants who passed through another country from seeking asylum in the US. The rule, proposed earlier this year, will presume migrants are ineligible for asylum in the US if they didn’t first seek refuge in a country they transited through, like Mexico, on the way to the border. Migrants who secure an appointment through the CBP One app will be exempt, according to officials.

40,FBI declines Comer’s request for a document some Republicans claim will show Joe Biden was involved in an illegal scheme,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/politics/fbi-grassley-documents-comer-biden/index.html,"      “You have asked for what you say is a ‘precise description’ of an ‘alleged criminal scheme’ contained in is a single FD-1023 report. You express concern that the FBI has inappropriately ‘failed to disclose’ such a report ‘to the American people,’” Christopher Dunham, acting assistant director for the FBI’s office of congressional affairs, said in the letter to Comer, a copy of which was obtained by CNN.
  

      “It is critical to the integrity of the entire criminal justice process and to the fulfillment of our law enforcement duties that FBI avoid revealing information — including unverified or incomplete information — that could harm investigations, prejudice prosecutions or judicial proceedings, unfairly violate privacy or reputational interests, or create misimpressions in the public,” he continued in the letter.
  

      FBI Director Christopher Wray declined during his testimony before the Senate Appropriations Committee on Wednesday to confirm whether the document exists.
  

      “I will tell you that we understand completely the importance of congressional oversight, that’s important to me,” Wray said. “I also understand very much, as I think you do, the importance of us protecting sources and methods and ongoing investigations.”
  

      The White House has previously slammed the unverified claim against Biden, calling it another one of Republicans’ “unfounded politically-motivated attacks.”
  

      In a six-page response to Comer, Dunham said that FD-1023 form is “used by FBI agents to record unverified reporting from a confidential human source,” and noted that there are strict Justice Department guidelines about when that information can be provided outside of the FBI.
  

      Dunham also outlined the shortcomings of relying solely on this law enforcement document – which includes unverified allegations – to draw conclusions. 
  

      “An FD-1023 form documents information as told to a line FBI agent. Recording the information does not validate the information, establish its credibility, or weigh it against other information known or developed by the FBI,” Dunham wrote. “The mere existence of such a document would establish little beyond the fact that a confidential human source provided information and the FBI recorded it. Indeed, the FBI regularly receives information from sources with significant potential biases, motivations, and knowledge, including drug traffickers, members of organized crime, or even terrorists.”
  

      Dunham added that such documents include “leads and suspicions” and “later and more complete reports might exonerate individuals cast in a negative light by reports from earlier in an investigation.”
  

      Comer and Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, claimed they had spoken to an unnamed whistleblower who claimed the FBI document included evidence that Biden, while vice president, was allegedly involved in an illegal payment that also involved a foreign national. Comer subpoenaed the document, setting a Wednesday deadline for the FBI to provide it. Pressed in media interviews for more details about the whistleblower’s claims, Grassley has admitted he does not know whether they are true or false. 
  

      “It’s clear from the FBI’s response that the unclassified record the Oversight Committee subpoenaed exists, but they are refusing to provide it to the Committee,” Comer said in a statement Wednesday. “We’ve asked the FBI to not only provide this record, but to also inform us what it did to investigate these allegations. The FBI has failed to do both. The FBI’s position is ‘trust, but you aren’t allowed to verify.’ That is unacceptable. We plan to follow up with the FBI and expect compliance with the subpoena.”
  

      Grassley added in a statement that “today’s letter from the FBI raises additional questions, including whether the FBI has an open investigation based on these allegations.”
  

      Dunham said in his letter to the committee that the FBI was willing to coordinate with committee staff to “to discuss whether and how we can accommodate your request without violating our law enforcement and national security obligations.”

41,"McCarthy blocks Tlaib event marking Palestinian displacement, known as Nakba",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/politics/mccarthy-tlaib-event/index.html,"      As Israel was created in 1948, a war broke out between the Israelis and Arabs, and some 700,000 Palestinians either fled or were expelled from their homes in what became the State of Israel. Many Arabs, especially Palestinians, commemorate the displacement every year as Nakba Day.
  

      McCarthy intervened late Tuesday to reserve the Capitol Visitor Center space where Tlaib – the first Palestinian-American US congresswoman – was going to host a Wednesday event, according to a spokesperson for McCarthy.
  

      Tlaib responded in a statement, saying, “Speaker McCarthy wants to rewrite history and erase the existence and truth of the Palestinian people, but he has failed to do so. This event is planned to bring awareness about the Nakba and create space for Palestinian Americans who experienced the Nakba firsthand to tell their stories of trauma and survival.”
  

      “We fully plan on moving forward with this event and we will continue to ensure that Palestinian voices are heard. We will not be silenced,” Tlaib said in the statement.
  

      The Michigan Democrat later confirmed to CNN that the event will still happen Wednesday evening at the Capitol, just not on the House side as originally planned. 
  

      “We’re having it on the Senate side. It’s on campus, it’s on Capitol Hill,” she said. 
  

Tlaib’s event was called “Nakba 75 & the Palestinian People, an educational community event featuring special guest, Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib.”
  

      According to the invitation, “May 15th marks 75 years since the beginning of the Nakba, which means ‘catastrophe.’ Seventy-five years ago, Zionist militias and the new Israeli military violently expelled approximately three-quarters of all Palestinians from their homes and homeland in what became the state of Israel.” 
  

      “To uplift the experiences of Palestinians who underwent the Nakba, and educate Members of Congress and their staff about this history and the ongoing Nakba to which Israel continues to subject Palestinians, we’ve partnered together to host this congressional and community educational event, to be followed immediately afterward by dinner,” the invite says.
  

      McCarthy will instead lead a bipartisan briefing celebrating the 75th anniversary of the US-Israel relationship instead, his office says.
  

      “It’s wrong for members of Congress to traffic in antisemitic tropes about Israel,” McCarthy said in a statement to CNN from his office. “As long as I’m speaker, we are going to support Israel’s right to self-determination and self-defense, unequivocally and in a bipartisan fashion.”
  

      The event was organized by a number of groups, including Institute for Middle East Understanding, Americans for Justice in Palestine Action, Project48, Democracy for the Arab World Now, US Campaign for Palestinian Rights, American Friends Service Committee, Virginia Coalition for Human Rights, Emgage Action and Jewish Voice for Peace Action.
  

      Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, praised McCarthy’s decision to cancel the event, saying it was “inappropriate.” 
  

      “I think Congresswoman Tlaib has freedom of speech, First Amendment, but the speech is very anti-Israel, pro-Palestinian, and I think very inappropriate on the 75th anniversary of the State of Israel being formed,” he said outside a Republican conference meeting.

42,"George Santos pleads not guilty to 13 federal charges, including fraud and money laundering",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/politics/george-santos-indicted-arrested/index.html,"      Santos was released on a $500,000 bond, according to the US Attorney’s Office in New York. He was ordered to surrender his passport and will need permission to travel outside of Washington, DC, New York City and Long Island.
  

      The New York Republican appeared in a federal court on Long Island on Wednesday. He has been charged on seven counts of wire fraud, three counts of money laundering, one count of theft of public funds and two counts of making materially false statements to the House of Representatives. 
  

George Santos charged in federal probe


      In a combative, impromptu press conference after his arraignment, Santos said that he has been “compliant throughout this entire process” but blasted the indictment as a “witch hunt” and said he will “fight my battle.” 
  

      The charges inject fresh uncertainty into the political future of Santos, a freshman congressman whose astonishing pattern of lies and fabrications stunned even hardened politicos and led top Democrats and some New York Republicans to call for his resignation earlier this year. 
  

      The congressman said on Wednesday that he will not resign from his seat and that he still plans to seek reelection next year.
  

      House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, said Wednesday he would wait before calling on Santos to resign.
  

      “It always concerns me,” McCarthy told CNN after being informed of the money laundering and wire fraud charges. 
  

      “He will go through his time in trial and let’s find out how the outcome is,” McCarthy added.
  

      Later, the speaker said he will not support Santos’ reelection, telling CNN that “Santos has a lot going on. I think he has other things to focus on in his life other than running for reelection.”
  

      McCarthy confirmed that if the Ethics Committee determines Santos broke the law, he would call for him to resign.  
  

      Prosecutors allege Santos, 34, solicited campaign funds under false pretense and used them for personal expenses like designer clothing.
  

      The indictment accuses Santos of undertaking a “fraudulent political contribution solicitation scheme,” alleging that he set up a company and got supporters to contribute funds to it under the false pretense that the money would benefit his political campaign.
  

      “Taken together, the allegations in the indictment charge Santos with relying on repeated dishonesty and deception to ascend to the halls of Congress and enrich himself,” said US Attorney Breon Peace in a statement. “He used political contributions to line his pockets, unlawfully applied for unemployment benefits that should have gone to New Yorkers who had lost their jobs due to the pandemic, and lied to the House of Representatives.” 
  

      Santos, who was elected last year to represent a district that includes parts of Long Island and Queens, has been under investigation in multiple jurisdictions and by the House Ethics Committee. The congressman has admitted to making some misleading claims about his education and financial status but continues to deny the more serious allegations. He has not admitted any crimes.
  

      He was taken into custody in Melville, a law enforcement source told CNN. From there, he was taken to the courthouse in Central Islip.
  

      Santos is accused of fraudulently applying for unemployment benefits, with the indictment alleging he falsely claimed to be unemployed in an application for a pandemic-related unemployment insurance program. 
  

      Though he claimed in the application he had been unemployed since March 2020, according to prosecutors, he was employed at an investment firm and, as part of a $120,000 annual salary, he was allegedly receiving regular deposits – with the exception of one period in July and August 2020.
  

Santos announces 2024 reelection campaign for New York congressional seat


      He was employed at the firm between February 2020 and mid-April 2021, the indictment alleges. But, because of the repeated false assertions he is alleged to have made to the unemployment program, Santos also received $24,744 in benefits, according to prosecutors.
  

      Santos made false statements on multiple financial disclosure reports to the House of Representatives during his two congressional races, according to the indictment. 
  

      Congressional candidates are required to file sworn financial disclosures before an election, which give a full accounting of that candidate’s finances, like their assets and income.  
  

      As part of his first congressional race in 2020, Santos filed two disclosures with the House that contained false statements. Santos claimed in the reports that he had earned $55,000 in salary, commission and bonuses from a company, identified in the indictment only as “Company #2.”  
  

      Santos also reported in the 2020 disclosure that the only compensation he received exceeding $5,000 from a single source was an “unspecified commission bonus from Company #2.” 
  

      Prosecutors say, however, that Santos only received $27,555 from Company #2. Santos also allegedly failed to disclose altogether a salary he earned from an unidentified investment firm.  
  

READ: The charges against Rep. George Santos


      The behavior continued when Santos filed his 2022 disclosure in that election – which he went on to win – according to the indictment. 
  

      Santos wrote on the form that in 2021 and 2022 his “earned income consisted of $750,000 in salary from the Devolder Organization LLC,” that his “unearned income included dividends from the Devolder Organization LLC valued at between $1,000,001 and $5,000,000” and that “he had no compensation exceeding $5,000 from a single source in which he had an ownership interest.” 
  

      The then-candidate also claimed on the 2022 form that he “owned a checking account with deposits totaling between $100,001 and $250,000” and “a savings account with deposits totaling between $1,000,001 and $5,000,000,” prosecutors said.
  

      “Contrary to these statements, in truth and in fact, as Santos then and there well knew and believed, he had not received from the Devolder Organization LLC the reported amounts of salary or dividends; he did not maintain checking or savings accounts with deposits in the reported amounts; and he received approximately $28,107 in income from (an investment firm Santos worked at) and approximately $20,304 in unemployment insurance benefits from (New York) during the same reporting period, all of which he failed to report as required,” the indictment said.
  

      As Santos faced multiple investigations earlier this year, a number of top Democrats and some Republicans called for him to step down from his seat, with those calls restarting Tuesday after CNN reported that he had been indicted. 
  

      Rep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican who has been one of the most outspoken Santos critics inside the party, said to CNN on Tuesday: “I reiterate my call that he should resign.”
  

      Another New York Republican, Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, told CNN, “I’m not surprised. I understand this is where it was headed.”
  

      Malliotakis emphasized on Tuesday that she needed to see the charges, but asked whether Santos should be removed from Congress she said: “I would love to see someone new run because I can tell you that we will hold that seat and so the sooner Santos leaves, the sooner we can get someone in there that is not a liar.”
  

      Other Republicans said it should be up to Santos’ district to decide his fate in Congress. 
  

      National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Emmer said “his constituents will deal with whatever issue.”

43,What to know about the charges against George Santos and what happens next,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/politics/george-santos-criminal-charges-explainer/index.html,"      The Long Island congressman, who has an extraordinary trail of falsehoods that emerged soon after he was elected and helped cement the narrow GOP House majority, pleaded not guilty on Wednesday to charges that range from wire fraud to theft of public money to false statements on his House disclosure reports. 
  

George Santos pleads not guilty to federal charges


      Santos is accused of funneling contributions meant to support his campaigns into his personal bank accounts, from where it was spent on luxury clothes and paying off debt. Prosecutors also allege he fraudulently applied for and received Covid-related unemployment benefits while receiving a six-figure salary working for an investment firm.  
  

      If convicted of the top counts in the indictment, Santos faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison, according to the Justice Department, though it’s more likely he’d receive a much lesser sentence. 
  

      Here’s what to know about the significance of the charges and what happens next:
  

      The indictment lays out three main buckets of alleged criminal activity by Santos. 
  

      The first scheme described by prosecutors are alleged false representations made by Santos to political donors that led them to make contributions that were not ultimately used to support his campaign. That alleged scheme has prompted five counts of wire fraud and three counts of unlawful monetary transactions. 
  

      The second set of accusations concern Santos’ allegedly false applications for unemployment benefits, resulting in a theft of public money count and two more wire fraud counts. 
  

READ: The charges against Rep. George Santos


      False statements that Santos is accused of making on financial disclosures he filed in the House led to two additional counts.
  

      Shanlon Wu, a white collar defense attorney and a former federal prosecutor, noted on CNN’s “Inside Politics” on Wednesday that the alleged fraud took place over a varied collection of supposed schemes, making it a tough case for Santos to mount a defense against. 
  

      “They’re actually all so different. He doesn’t have a single unifying theme, like, ‘oh I misunderstood the unemployment benefits, I didn’t realize I couldn’t raise money falsely for my campaign.’ It’s so diverse,” Wu said. 
  

      Prosecutors say Santos lied in documents submitted to Congress about the size and sources of his income in both of his bids for the US House of Representatives. 
  

      It’s against the law to make false statements on the financial disclosure reports that all congressional candidates and federal lawmakers must file, and the investigation appears to have uncovered more details about Santos’ true financial picture.  
  

      Ever since his surprise election win last fall, Santos has faced questions about his representation that he earned big sums in 2022 from a firm he had established, a dramatic change in his financial circumstances after reporting no assets and a salary of just $55,000 in his failed House bid just two years earlier.
  

      The charging documents made public Wednesday claim Santos misrepresented his actual income in both campaigns and inflated his income and assets ahead of the 2022 election, falsely claiming a paycheck of $750,000 from his firm, the Devolder Organization, and purporting to have a savings account worth between $1 million and $5 million. 
  

      None of that was true, prosecutors say. Instead, Santos earned $28,107 from an investment firm ahead of the 2022 election and a little more than $20,000 in unemployment insurance benefits “all of which he failed to report as required,” according to the complaint. 
  

      Erin Chlopak, senior director of campaign finance with the Campaign Legal Center watchdog group, said these financial disclosures are crucial to helping voters understand candidates and potential financial conflicts of interest with the offices they are seeking. 
  

      “Where (candidates) get their money from is part of the picture that voters assess,” she said. “When someone lies about it, voters are misled and potentially duped into making a different decision.” 
  

      If the case against Santos does go to trial, prosecutors have indicated they have financial records, text messages and other forms of evidence to support their case. 
  

      Prosecutors aren’t required to show their full hand at the charging phase, so it could be that the new indictment is just a preview of what investigators have collected. 


      The indictment suggests that investigators have obtained emails and texts messages where Santos allegedly made false representations that led to contributions to what donors thought were entities that were supporting this campaign. 
  

      “It appears that they have pretty strong documentary evidence” and are not relying on circumstantial evidence to establish motives, Chlopak said. The Campaign Legal Center filed a complaint against Santos with election regulators in January and urged the Justice Department to investigate his actions.   
  

      The speed at which the probe has moved indicates “how easy of an investigation it’s been, up until this point,” Wu said. 
  

      Key to the alleged scheme was an individual identified in the indictment as “Person 1,” who is described as a “political consultant operating in Queens County and the surrounding areas.” The charging papers indicate that investigators have texts and emails that individual sent to contributors, too, and prosecutors may also have that person’s testimony. The indictment describes that person taking certain actions to allegedly further the scheme “at the direction” of Santos and testimony would flesh out that allegation. 
  

      It appears prosecutors also have financial records that would allegedly show that the political contributions that were wired to an entity identified as “Company 1” – which is described in the indictment as a Florida LLC, for which Santos’ company is listed as a manager.  Transfers were then allegedly made from Company 1 to Santos’ personal bank accounts, and financial records would also help back those accusations. 
  

      Prosecutors allege Santos spent the money on “luxury designer clothing, credit card payments, a car payment, payments on personal debts,” as well as with cash withdrawals and transfers to associates. Those are allegations prosecutors may seek to prove to the jury through receipts or other evidence of the alleged purchases. 
  

      To establish the alleged unemployment fraud scheme, investigators likely have the attestations Santos allegedly made to participate in the public benefits program. The federal and state agencies that administer the pandemic benefits program are thanked in DOJ’s press release for their assistance. The indictment suggests investigators also obtained bank records indicating that Santos allegedly was receiving regular deposits from a $120,000 per year salary while he was said to have been enrolled in the unemployment program. 
  

      The House disclosure documents that Santos allegedly lied on are publicly available documents. Many of the same financial records prosecutors say they have obtained to establish the other alleged crimes appear to support their accusations that he made false statements on the forms. 
  

      On Wednesday afternoon, Santos made his first appearance in court, pleaded not guilty and was released on a $500,000 bond. He had to surrender his passport and will need court approval to travel beyond New York and Washington, DC. 
  

      The proceedings will now enter a pre-trial phase that could stretch out for several months. Santos’ lawyers will have the chance to ask that his case be dismissed. If the judge declines to and rules that the case can advance towards trial, there will be pretrial litigation over what kind of evidence the prosecutors can put before the jury and what kind of defense Santos can mount in response. Other procedural disputes may well come up in this phase.  
  

      There’s also the potential that, instead of a jury trial, Santos seeks a bench trial – i.e. a trial before just the judge. 
  

      At any point, it’s possible that Santos and the Justice Department could reach a plea deal that would make a trial unnecessary. If the case goes to trial and Santos is ultimately convicted, he will have a chance to appeal the verdict. 
  

      A criminal indictment does not automatically lead to removal from Congress.  
  

      There are no federal laws that affect the status of a lawmaker who has been charged with – or even found guilty of – a felony.  Despite calls to resign from many Democrats and some Republicans in New York state, Santos has so far resisted those efforts. 
  

      Lawmakers can opt for expulsion to remove a convicted House member, but it’s a rare occurrence. Only five members of the House have been removed – and just two since the aftermath of the Civil War. The sanction requires a two-thirds vote. 
  

      The most recent case involved Ohio Democrat Jim Traficant, who was convicted in 2002 on bribery, racketeering and tax evasion charges. Later that year, he was expelled from the House by a 420-1 vote.

But here I am, back in the office and going to work. Not a full schedule yet, but I’ll get there pretty soon.”

45,House GOP leaders lock down votes for border bill after facing rebellion,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/politics/house-republicans-border-bill/index.html,"      House Speaker Kevin McCarthy huddled with key lawmakers in House Majority Whip Tom Emmer’s office on Wednesday afternoon, where they walked members through their concerns and hammered out language designed to address lingering concerns over provisions related to E-verify and Mexican cartels.
  

      Afterward, Republicans left the meeting signaling support for the bill and leadership scheduled a Wednesday evening vote on a rule to govern the bill’s floor debate. Earlier, leadership recessed the floor ahead of the planned rule vote as they worked to find a path forward. 
  

      Final passage is scheduled for Thursday – a vote strategically timed to coincide with the expiration of Title 42, a pandemic-era policy that allowed certain migrants to be turned away at the border.


      Republican leaders worked for months to negotiate the border and immigration package, a signature piece of legislation and an issue they ran on in the midterms. 
  

      But they were still running into last-minute pockets of opposition on the day before the vote and worked behind the scenes to resolve the impasse.
  

      One issue had been over language that asks the secretary of homeland security to issue a report determining whether Mexican cartels are a “foreign terrorist organization.” Some Republicans are pushing leadership to take it out of the bill, concerned it could create a new “credible fear” claim for asylum seekers. 
  

      Rep. Dan Crenshaw, a Texas Republican, told CNN that he knew of at least five Republicans who are “hard no” votes if the provision remains. 
  

      “It’s stupid, it’s counterproductive,” Crenshaw said of the foreign terrorist organization language. “That’s what people are rebelling against.”
  

      Florida Rep. Byron Donalds confirmed that leaders will be tweaking the bill to address members’ concern, including an amendment to change the foreign terrorist organization language. 
  

      By late Wednesday afternoon, Rep. Andrew Clyde said he was a “yes” on the bill after saying his concerns over “foreign terrorist organization” had been addressed, though he did not elaborate further. 
  

      Virginia Rep. Bob Good, a member of the hardline House Freedom Caucus, told CNN he was also among the Republicans pushing for changes to the FTO language, and had communicated his concerns to leadership. 
  

      He said he’d be able to support the border bill if the language is removed or changed.
  

      There were also still lingering concerns over a provision in the bill to expand E-verify, a database employers use to verify immigration status. Republicans representing districts with agriculture were worried that without reworking the agricultural visa program, the provision could make it more difficult for rural farmers to find a pipeline of workers. 
  

      A handful of Republicans representing agricultural-heavy districts had thought the issue had been resolved with leadership and that the bill would be updated to include language that would study the implications of E-Verify before the program was required. That minor change was supposed to happen in the Rules Commitee, but a source familiar told CNN that some conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus were opposed and the amendment wasn’t added. That caused further heartburn Wednesday as leaders were trying to cement support for the bill.
  

      Democrats are not expected to back the measure, meaning Republicans can only afford to lose four votes. 
  

      Rep. Tim Burchett said late Wednesday afternoon he is “leaning favorably” and predicted there are only two remaining Republican holdouts on the issue of E-verify. 
  

      GOP Rep. Tony Gonzales, who represents a Texas border district, told CNN as he left House Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s office earlier in the day that he is not sure if he will support the GOP border bill.
  

      “That’s a damn good question,” he told reporters.
  

      Gonzales has been a long holdout on the package but had recently expressed he would support the deal that became the final package. 
  

      Rep. Dan Newhouse of Washington, who represents an agriculture district, said he could get to yes on the bill if there is an amendment requiring a report studying the impacts of the E-verify on the workforce before the provision is implemented.
  

      “We’re still talking about an amendment,” he said. “I think we’re getting really close.”
  

      Later on Wednesday, Newhouse, in a tweet, said that House GOP leadership has committed to addressing his issues on E-verify in the package and will now support the package.
  

      House Homeland Security Chairman Mark Green told CNN he did not think the language of the bill would be changing any further, but in a sign of how in flux negotiations are, he added, “that could change in the next half hour.”
  

      Even though he said he did not know if there is enough support for the package Green projected confidence telling CNN, “what I’m hearing is we are good to go.”
  

      Green said he thought the issues relating to language addressing foreign terrorist organizations were addressed with members in their conference meeting Wednesday morning. 
  

      “I think we addressed that in conference this morning to everybody. We brought up how the asylum laws are written now and made pretty clear that it’s a government that has to be oppressing that person or threatening that person and we also put in this language that says nothing in this would construe the asylum is granted because they get named as foreign terrorist organizations,” he added.
  

      The GOP border bill, which is dead on arrival in the Senate, would restart construction of the border wall, increase funding for border agents and upgraded border technology, reinstate the “remain in Mexico” policy, place new restrictions on asylum seekers, and enhance requirements for E-verify.

Don Bacon told CNN’s Melanie Zanona. “I would see very dark clouds on the horizon if he is the nominee,” added Bacon, who represents a Nebraska district President Joe Biden won and has already said he will not support Trump for the nomination.
  

      The jury found Trump sexually abused former magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll in a New York Department store in 1996 and that he was liable for battery and defamation, while awarding her $5 million. The unanimous jury verdict was vindication for Carroll and offered a symbolic win for other women who have made assault allegations against the president. Trump, who has denied all wrongdoing, immediately denounced the trial as a witch hunt and said he didn’t even know Carroll. He said later Tuesday evening that he will appeal.
  

      For most of modern US history and for most candidates, Tuesday’s developments would raise potentially insurmountable questions of viability. Many White House hopefuls have exited presidential races for less. And Trump, who’s pleaded not guilty in a separate criminal case involving hush money payments to an adult film star in New York, is facing multiple legal threats. He’s waiting to see whether he will be indicted in separate probes into his attempt to overthrow the 2020 election and his hoarding of classified documents. But the fact that Trump won’t quit the GOP race – and no one will make him – shows his dominance of the Republican Party, and how he redefined behavioral expectations for public life.
  

      No one can know how Tuesday’s verdict will influence the voters in GOP primaries early next year or the outcome of a national election that is 18 months away. Since the trial was civil rather than criminal in nature, Trump will not face a conviction or jail time. And multiple other dramas surrounding Trump, if he’s the nominee, and Biden will likely erupt and shape the campaign next year, when this verdict will be a mere memory.
  

      Still, the immediate political reverberations of the Carroll case are already playing out in the Republican presidential race and among key GOP figures in Washington, offering a window into the state of the party and national politics as it stands now.
  

      There has so far been silence from most of Trump’s rivals or potential foes in the GOP nominating contest. The lack of response underscores how 2024 hopefuls are struggling to define their profiles as alternatives to him while seeking to avoid angering his supporters. No statement has yet emerged from former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley or prospective White House contender, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. While there is a clear sense of exhaustion among some Republican voters over Trump’s endless scandals and personal political vulnerabilities, those who have voiced that frustration aren’t polling anywhere near the former president, if they’re running at all.
  

      Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson – who earned 1% in a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents – did step up with an unequivocal condemnation of Trump. He told CNN’s Erin Burnett that the jury system was sacrosanct, that the jurors in this case had delivered a judgment that meant Trump was not fit to serve and that Republicans should consider the electoral implications of having such a candidate leading their ticket.
  

      “I give respect to what juries find. By and large they get it right,” Hutchinson said, arguing that having a president who’d been found liable of sexual abuse would counter core US values. He said that the United States was remarkable for its jury and justice systems. “Let’s not undermine it and disrespect it.”
  

      But having defined much of his candidacy against Trump, Hutchinson is considered a longshot.
  

      House Speaker Kevin McCarthy characteristically dodged commenting on the verdict after leaving debt crisis talks at the White House on Tuesday. But the California Republican did Trump a service by pointing out that the ex-president – a forceful influence on his narrow House majority – had denied wrongdoing.
  

      Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a staunch Trump supporter, amplified the ex-president’s claims that he can’t get a fair trial in Manhattan – a reference to the hush money case as well as Tuesday’s verdict. “I think the New York legal system is off the rails when it comes to Donald Trump,” Graham said.
  

      One of the most fervent opponents of Trump’s behavior, Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, did not hold back. He noted that “the jury of his peers” found Trump liable for sexual abuse “and awarded $5 million to the person who was damaged.” The 2012 GOP presidential nominee added, “I hope the jury of the American people reach the same conclusion about Donald Trump.”
  

      As scathing as it was, Romney’s disdain for Trump could have been predicted.
  

      Cramer of North Dakota – who in March pointed out that Trump’s indictment in the hush money case didn’t equal a conviction – did express some concern about Tuesday’s developments, though he also nodded to the political factors that could insulate Trump from long-term damage.
  

      “It’s very serious. But I think as a political matter, it’s less interesting to the people outside Washington, DC, than it is inside these walls or on Capitol Hill,” he said.
  

      “I’d much rather have a president that doesn’t have that history, but at the same time, at some point, there’ll be a binary choice, and then we’ll make it.”
  

      This is far from the first time that questions have been raised about Trump’s treatment of women – and how that could turn off some voters. The debate now is whether this time is any different.
  

      Asked by CNN’s Jake Tapper whether the verdict in New York should disqualify Trump from being the GOP nominee, former Trump White House communications director Alyssa Farah Griffin said, “I guess the answer is, it should.”
  

      “This one of the many firsts in history that Donald Trump has managed to achieve – a new low,” added Griffin, now a CNN political commentator. She pointed out that after the 2016 emergence of the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape – in which Trump boasted that stars could grab women’s genitals with impunity – many Republicans worried about his character. Now, she argued, those concerns had been validated by a jury of his peers that found Trump liable for sexual abuse. “We cannot afford to put this man up as Republicans if we actually want to win because women will run from voting from him.”
  

      Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who has criticized Trump in the past, said: “Of course it creates concern. How could it not create concern?” But he added that it was up to voters to decide whether it should disqualify him.
  

      Senate Minority Whip John Thune, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said he doesn’t think the verdict will affect the Trump base, but it may influence some swing voters who are critical to a general election.  
  

      “I do think there’s a, you know, cumulative effect to just the constant drama and chaos that always seems to surround him. But, you know, like I said, that doesn’t seem to impact his hardcore supporters,” the South Dakota Republican told reporters. 
  

      That’s in part a consequence of Trump and his conservative media cheerleaders having done such an effective job of delegitimizing in the eyes of his supporters any institution that holds him to account, including the courts.
  

      Trump’s connection with his voters is an emotional one. His coalition delights in his refusal to live by the rules of what are seen as establishment elites – and even the rule of law. His claims that he is a victim of Democrats who have weaponized the legal system are a powerful organizing principle of his campaign. So, it’s hard to see the ex-president’s core supporters turning against him on this issue after so many tumultuous years.
  

      One of his staunchest supporters in Congress, Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, spelled out a truism of the Trump era when he told reporters Tuesday evening that he didn’t think the verdict “is going to make much of a difference.”

47,Trump’s primary polling advantage is historically large,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/politics/donald-trump-polls/index.html,"      While we cannot yet know what effect that verdict will have on the race for the Republican nomination, Trump’s large polling advantage was built with this civil trial in the news and after being indicted earlier this spring in a separate criminal case related to hush money payments to Stormy Daniels. (Trump has denied all wrongdoing.) 
  

      The leads Trump has in surveys of Republican voters and in endorsements from elected officials at this stage are some of the strongest for a nonincumbent in the modern presidential primary era. 
  

      Trump is polling, on average, north of 50% in national polls of likely GOP primary voters. His nearest potential challenger – Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has yet to launch a campaign – is earning a little north of 20% of the Republican primary vote on average. No other potential Republican candidate is in double digits. 
  

Why Trump is still favored for the GOP nomination, despite his indictment


      There are very few candidates, of either party, in nonincumbent races who were near or north of 50% in the national primary polls this early on. Those included Republicans Bob Dole in 1996 and George W. Bush in 2000, and Democrats Al Gore in 2000 and Hillary Clinton in 2016. All of those candidates won their party’s nominations, and none of those races were particularly close. 
  

      Interestingly, all the legal controversies involving Trump have not hurt him in the polls. At the beginning of the year, Trump was earning a little more than 40% of the vote, on average, and was only about 10 points ahead of DeSantis. Trump’s lead is now triple that at closer to 30 points, on average.
  

      The advantages that DeSantis once had have similarly melted away. In New Hampshire, for example – the site of Wednesday’s town hall – DeSantis was up by 12 points over Trump at the beginning of the year, according to University of New Hampshire polling. Trump has now opened up a 20-point advantage in the latest UNH survey among likely GOP primary voters. 
  

      Of course, if it was solely the polls where Trump was ahead, that might be one thing. Polling isn’t always predictive, and there could be some underlying dynamic that could shift it. But the other big factor working in Trump’s favor is that many elected members of the party are behind him. 
  

      Trump has the endorsements of well more than 60 Republican governors and members of Congress. None of the Republicans running or thinking of running even come close to double digits endorsements from elected officials of that level. 
  

      The importance of endorsements should not be understated. The party apparatus uniting behind one candidate can often be key in turning a race around. On the Democratic side in 2020, for example, Joe Biden was lifted when his former rivals endorsed him ahead of Super Tuesday. 
  

      The failure of the GOP establishment to back a single Trump alternative in 2016 was part of the reason he was able to win the nomination. Elected Republican officials were splintered on who they wanted to be the nominee, and Trump was able to take advantage of this divided field. 
  

      This time around that option of the establishment rallying to a non-Trump candidate isn’t available to the same degree. Anyone who had a similar share of endorsements as Trump at this point in the nomination process has gone on to win their party’s nomination since 1980. 
  

      The 1980 Democratic presidential primary might give us a clue. It remains the only time in modern history in which a nonincumbent (Ted Kennedy) was polling north of 45% at this point and didn’t go on to be his party’s nominee. 
  

      Kennedy’s bid was overtaken by events on the ground. Specifically, then-President Jimmy Carter rallied back to win the nomination following the beginning of the Iranian hostage crisis. What was a clear lead for Kennedy became a large Carter advantage basically overnight. 
  

      The crucial difference here is that there isn’t an incumbent in the 2024 Republican race. Still, there are a lot of potential events involving Trump. 
  

      We don’t know how Republicans will react to his loss in civil court, which Trump has said he will appeal. We don’t know what will happen if he is convicted in a possible criminal trial related to the hush money payments. (After being charged by a Manhattan grand jury with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in that case, he’s trying to move it to federal court.) We don’t know what will happen if he is indicted in other cases around the country related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, his conduct in the run-up to the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, and his handling of classified documents. 
  

      Perhaps the biggest unknown is how Republican voters will react if DeSantis actually gets into the race. It’s possible voters look at him differently if and when he truly starts campaigning.
  

      For now, though, Trump is well ahead. It will take something big to knock him off his perch at the top of the Republican polls.

48,Why we don’t entirely know what would come after a US debt default,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/09/politics/debt-ceiling-x-date-what-matters/index.html,"      The warnings about a US debt default are earnest and urgent:
  

      Default would cause a “Social Security shutdown,” according to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.
  

      There would be “economic calamity,” according to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.
  

      For a Republican prediction, look to the “widespread job losses, decimated retirement savings and higher borrowing costs” anticipated by Joshua Bolten, the CEO of Business Roundtable and the former White House chief of staff under President George W. Bush. 
  

      Negotiations between the White House and congressional Republicans just got underway Tuesday with the first in-person debt default meeting between President Joe Biden, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and other leaders.  


Moody’s Analytics has predicted a 2008-style crisis, with “spiking interest rates and plunging equity prices,” even if it’s just a brief breach of the debt limit. 
  

      CNN’s Tami Luhby and Elisabeth Buchwald have documented these possible outcomes: “5 ways a debt default could affect you.”


      But for all the warnings, the specifics of when the US will cross the so-called X-date – when the country could default – and what will happen in the immediate aftermath are maddeningly vague.
  

      “It is impossible to predict with certainty the exact date when Treasury will be unable to pay the government’s bills,” Yellen told McCarthy in a letter last week.
  

      She said the X-date could arrive as soon as June 1.
  

      Other estimates, like this one from the Bipartisan Policy Center, suggest the X-date could occur any time between early June and early August.
  

      The specifics of what exactly will happen seem a bit like forecasting a hurricane – there is a predicted path, but nobody really knows what will happen when the storm makes landfall.
  

      While there have been periodic standoffs over the debt ceiling during past periods of divided government, a default has never occurred.
  

      And it is important to note, as Luhby and Buchwald do, that the government does not simply cease to operate.
  

      “To be clear, a debt default doesn’t mean all payments would stop and people would permanently lose out on money they are owed,” they write. “Treasury would have the funds to satisfy some obligations, but it’s not certain how the agency would handle the disbursements. Much would also depend on how long it takes Congress to address the borrowing cap.”
  

      Yellen would have to decide whether to prioritize creditors who own debt or the many people who rely on government money for their paycheck or retirement benefits.
  

      Thus, Schumer’s prediction that Social Security would shut down seems unlikely, although payments could be delayed.
  

      Some of the worst predictions are based on the event that lawmakers do not quickly come together when markets get spooked by the lack of action.
  

      In the scenario of a protracted default, a recession would cost millions of jobs and drive up the unemployment rate, according to a report from the White House Council of Economic Advisers.
  

      One likely effect in any default is that simply having the debt will be more expensive. Confidence in the US paying interest on the debt it sells will be shaken. Rates would likely go up.
  

      But in the immediate term, there is a distinct lack of clarity on what the Treasury Department would decide to pay and what it might not.
  
Interactive: The $31.4 trillion debt dilemma

      For an idea of what it’s facing, look at the Monthly Treasury Statement, the most recent of which is from March. 
  

Receipts: $313 billion


      In March, the government brought in $313 billion in total receipts, including $151 billion from individual income taxes; $133 billion in social insurance and retirement taxes, which includes Social Security payroll taxes; and $11 billion in corporation income taxes, among other sources.
  

Outlays: $691 billion


      In March, the government doled out $115 billion for Medicare, $115 billion to Social Security, $87 billion for income security, $86 billion for health spending, $84 billion for national defense and $67 billion for interest on the debt, among other things.
  

      Those figures vary from month to month, and the $378 billion deficit in March was the second largest in the past year. 
  

      A lot of people get money from the government. 
  

      There are more than 2 million federal civilian workers, millions of federal contractors and around 1.4 million active-duty military members, plus all of the dependents who rely on them. Delays to their paychecks, if it came to that, would ripple out into the economy.
  

      The number of retirees, disabled workers and others who receive monthly Social Security benefits is much larger, at about 66 million. 
  

      More than a third of US households get Social Security payments and, separately, more than a third of households are covered by Medicare, according to census data from 2020. Nearly a quarter of households get federal help with health insurance for either adults or children.
  

      The current impasse between Republicans and the White House is over spending cuts the GOP wants to enact now that it holds a slim majority in the House. They passed a bill through the House as a sort of opening offer in negotiations. 
  

      While the debt ceiling will have to be lifted in the coming months, cuts in the bill Republicans passed would not begin immediately. Instead, they would be implemented with the 2024 fiscal year. 
  

      That funding would also get separate votes later this year, so expect additional spending debates. In exchange for the cuts, Republicans are offering an approximately one-year $1.5 trillion debt ceiling hike. 
  

RELATED: 43 Senate Republicans vow to oppose debt ceiling increase without spending cuts


      The GOP spending cut proposal also lacks specifics. 
  

      Applying the cuts across the board would reduce spending by an average of 18% over 10 years at every federal agency, according to a New York Times estimate. 
  

      But Republicans have said they would not target Social Security, Medicare, veterans or defense spending – which make up a very large portion of the budget. Applying the equivalent of an across-the-board cut to the remaining federal agencies could result in more than 50% in cuts over 10 years to spending at every agency from Health and Human Services to the Department of Justice. 
  

      Biden and Democrats seem unlikely to ever agree to that level of spending cuts. The question is what they will agree to, if anything, and whether any agreement comes before the unknown consequences of a debt default.

50,Analysis: Three experts explain America’s gun politics,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/08/americas/guns-politics-allen-meanwhile-in-america-intl/index.html,"      At this point, it’s no surprise that there’s been another mass shooting in America.
  

      The latest tragedy came in Allen, Texas, on Saturday when a gunman opened fire on shoppers at an outlet mall. It was another horrific attack on people simply going about their lives, whether at shops, a bank, parties, schools, places of worship or even at their own homes.
  

      After every shooting, the political rituals are the same. Republicans who have harnessed their party to activists who want to loosen gun laws offer prayers for the victims and talk vaguely about a mental health crisis. Democrats demand more gun control and a ban on fast-firing assault weapons that can kill multiple people in seconds.
  

      But nothing ever changes.
  

      Is there any way out of this endless cycle of death? Or is the political system simply too deadlocked — even though majorities of Americans in most polls favor some kind of reform to gun laws.
  

      Meanwhile asked three expert contributors from CNN’s “Guns in America” unit about the implications of the latest horror and the state of guns politics in the country.
  

Jennifer Mascia is a senior news writer with “The Trace,” an independent news operation dedicated to covering America’s gun violence epidemic.
  

Meanwhile: Some state officials in pro-gun Texas have argued that since mass shootings also occur in liberal states with tighter gun laws, more restrictions would be not work. Is this true?


      Mass shootings do occur in states with tight gun laws, as we saw with Monterey Park and Half Moon Bay in California earlier this year. But the states with the loosest gun laws still tend to have higher rates of gun death.
  

      According to the most recent CDC figures, the states with the lowest rates of gun death (which includes both homicides and suicides) are Massachusetts, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island; California is 8th. Those states all have gun owner licensing, which means you must get a license or permit before you can even buy a gun. That process typically involves a thorough background check, interviews with law enforcement, character references, mandatory firearm training, and fingerprints. Gun owner licensing, also referred to as permit-to-purchase, is considered the most effective policy at reducing gun deaths.
  

Meanwhile: What are the states with the most deaths from firearms?


How US gun culture stacks up with the world 


      The states with the highest rates of gun death are Mississippi, Louisiana, New Mexico, Alabama, and Wyoming; Texas is 28th. With the exception of New Mexico, all of those states (including Texas) have enacted permitless carry, meaning gun owners are not required to get a license or undergo training in order to carry a concealed gun in public. There are 27 permitless carry states now, and studies have shown that gun violence rises after states loosen concealed carry requirements. A study last year from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health found that the average rate of gun assaults rose 9.5% in the first decade after 34 states relaxed their concealed carry restrictions. Missouri provides an interesting case study: Until 2007, the state required permits to purchase guns, like Massachusetts, California, and a dozen other states do. In the five years after permit-to-purchase was repealed, the murder rate rose 14%, one study found. Missouri further loosened its gun laws, enacting permitless carry in 2017. In 2019, the Kansas City Star found that the firearm death rate in Missouri had risen 58% since 2007, when the state eliminated permit-to-purchase.
  

Meanwhile: How does the US compare to the rest of the world?


      Bottom line: In terms of gun violence, you’re safer in California than you are in Texas. But you’re still safer in other countries than you are in California. That’s because, to quote UCLA law professor Adam Winkler, “California has the strictest gun laws in the US but some of the loosest, most permissive gun laws in the industrialized world.” And that explains why California still has mass shootings: Our strongest gun laws are still no match for those in Canada, the UK, Japan, Switzerland, or Israel, among others. Those countries are very careful who they allow to have guns and the screening process lasts many months. The only system that’s comparable is New York City’s gun permitting process, which is overseen by the NYPD.
  

Abené Clayton is the lead reporter for The Guardian’s “Guns and Lies in America” team
  

Meanwhile: Texas officials seemed to be very loath to offer many specific details about the mass shooting at the shopping mall. What is going on here?


      I believe that Texas—and most officials who are staunch gun rights and Second Amendment protectors—are working overtime to put distance between guns and the violence that we saw this weekend and continue to see daily. I believe that in addition to wanting to keep their voter base happy, many officials are genuinely afraid of armed resistance from extremists who own guns and are willing to die or create chaos if there is even a hint that there will be limitations put on gun ownership and retention.
  

      I also think that the lack of acknowledgment of broader issues of gun violence is meant to maintain the narrative that mass shootings are the result of spiritual warfare or innate evil. Conveniently for officials, neither of these factors can be legislated so it gives them the opportunity to point to a reason for shootings but take no accountability for supporting and creating solutions that will keep people safe.
  

Meanwhile: If local state officials won’t enact measures to stop massacres – or at least try to – what are their obligations for example in doing something meaningful to address mental health problems that they always cite – or to help mitigate the trauma of the victims?


      There are federal and some state victim assistance programs specifically geared toward people of mass violence and terrorism. (…) I think that state officials need to support, empower, and uplift survivors of mass shootings even though some become politically activated around issues—like red flag laws and assault weapon bans—that may not be palatable for right-leaning legislators’ bases.
  

      Politicians like Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz — both Republicans — and all the local and state officials that refuse to have good faith arguments about gun violence prevention solutions (outside of more police and school hardening) need to at minimum show genuine care to the people who lose loved ones and are irreparably injured following a shooting.
  

Stephen Gutowski founded the “The Reload” — a subscriber publication set up to provide sober, informed reporting on gun ownership in the United States.
  

Meanwhile: Is there any chance that the country’s fractured politics can produce anything to stop this cycle of shootings?


      There is broad agreement that more needs to be done to prevent mass shootings. The problem is that there’s little agreement between the parties on how to do that. Democrats generally favor broad gun restrictions and bans. Republicans generally favor stricter enforcement of current gun laws and mental health intervention. There is likely some crossover on either point among voters but little among their elected representatives.
  

      If these high-profile killings continue to increase, and they are happening at a record pace this year regardless of what count you look at, it could increase pressure for new gun restrictions. That’s what led to last year’s federal gun-control law. But there’s little reason to think it could result in a new national ban on AR-15s or other firearms because there is no support for that among congressional Republicans, and there is unlikely to be even 50 votes for it in the Senate since some Democrats also oppose a ban.
  

Meanwhile: Where is the action to watch on gun policy legislation?


      State-level policy is becoming increasingly polarized based on the prevailing politics in each state. Red states are focused on reducing attacks by making it easier for law-abiding citizens to obtain and carry guns. Blue states have turned increasingly to bans on “assault weapons” and ammunition magazines that hold a certain amount of ammunition. “Red Flag” laws that allow officials to temporarily seize guns from people determined by a judge to be a threat to themselves or others have mostly caught on in Democratic strongholds.
  

      But Tennessee’s Republican Gov. Bill Lee is attempting to address some of those concerns in a new proposal the Republican-controlled legislature is set to debate in a special session. If they can craft a policy addressing gun rights advocates’ concerns, that could create momentum for the policy in other states. That makes this gun policy debate the most noteworthy at the moment.

51,Greg Abbott’s gun law avoidance strategy,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/08/politics/texas-gun-laws-what-matters/index.html,"      Steven Spainhouer is a Second Amendment supporter and a gun owner. But after pulling a bloody child out from under a dead adult – one of eight killed at an outlet mall in Allen, Texas, on Saturday – he’s ready for a new national assault weapons ban.
  

      “I hear our governor talking about mental health issues,” Spainhouer said of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott during a Monday appearance on “CNN This Morning.” 
  

      “We’re always going to have mental health issues. But if we don’t do something about the guns, the people-killing guns, then we’re going to continue to have the same thing happen,” Spainhouer said.
  

      “Until we take some definite actions, we’re changing the narrative about it being just a mental health issue and start doing something about the guns,” he added.
  

      He equated the kind of imposition an assault weapons ban places on individual rights to limits on certain types of speech. Watch the interview with Spainhouer.
  

      Rather than moving toward a new assault weapons ban, Americans almost seem used to mass shootings. They are “part of the background noise of daily life,” CNN’s Stephen Collinson wrote last week after a mass shooting in Atlanta. 
  

      “They are part of the national reality – almost like bad weather – that causes people to shudder and hope it doesn’t affect their neighborhoods or their families before they carry on with their lives.”
  

      If the shootings feel somehow normal, so do the post-shooting promises from politicians. 
  

      As Spainhouer noted, Abbott returned to his familiar post-shooting refrain that it’s not gun laws that are needed, but a focus on mental health.
  

      “We’ve seen an increased number of shootings in states with easy gun laws as well as states with very strict gun laws,” Abbott, a Republican, said on “Fox News Sunday.”


      Abbott said there’s an increase in “anger and violence” and the root cause is “mental health problems.”
  

      Admitting that Texas has lagged in mental health for years, he said the state has increased funding over the past three years.
  

      “The long-term solution here is to address the mental health issue,” Abbott said. 
  

      It’s an argument that also quietly acknowledges the fact that most gun deaths in Texas are suicides.
  

      But while Abbott argued, correctly, that mass shootings can happen in any state, what he failed to mention is that that there are just simply more gun deaths, including suicides, in states with more lax gun laws. We looked at that data in this newsletter almost exactly a year ago after the Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde, Texas.
  

      Another Texas Republican, Rep. Keith Self, also blamed mental health during an interview on CNN on Saturday.
  

      “We have people with mental health, though, that we’re not taking care of,” said Self, who represents the Dallas suburb of Allen in Congress. “Since this nation made the decision that we were going to close the mental health institutions, many of these situations are based on that.”
  

      Questions about mental health have been a theme in Texas shootings.
  

Help is there if you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts or mental health matters.In the US: Call or text 988, the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.Globally: The International Association for Suicide Prevention and Befrienders Worldwide have contact information for crisis centers around the world.
  

Devin Patrick Kelley, for instance, killed 26 people with an AR-15-style rifle at a rural Texas church in a mass shooting in 2017. He legally obtained his weapons despite escaping from a mental health facility in 2012 and being convicted of domestic violence. Kelley passed a background check in part because the Air Force failed to enter his conviction into federal databases, according to The New York Times.
  

      Other shooters might never be flagged for mental illness. The Uvalde shooter, Salvador Ramos, was a loner who used a social media app to threaten school shootings in the weeks leading up to his rampage.
  

      It was a major understatement for Abbott to say that Texas merely lags on mental health. 
  

      A report from the nonprofit Mental Health America places the state at or near the bottom of multiple metrics for mental health care. Texas places last in the nation in terms of access to mental health care. It ranks third in terms of prevalence of mental illness. 
  

      Texas State Sen. Jose Menendez, a Democrat, accused Abbott and others of using the mental health issue as a smoke screen to avoid more meaningful change, like implementing a so-called red flag law.
  

      “It appears that using mental health is just a shield in order to not address the issue of what’s actually killing the people,” Menendez told CNN’s Phil Mattingly on Monday, adding he agrees that more should be done for people with mental illness.
  

      “But we also have to do something about what’s actually killing the people, and that is these guns, these high-powered guns,” Menendez said.
  

      “There’s a reason we don’t allow people to have grenades and bazookas,” Menendez said. “These are weapons of war. And I believe these AR-15 high-capacity rifles are also weapons that belong in the theater of war.”
  

      Menendez complained that proposals related to safe gun and ammunition storage and proposals for a red flag law, universal background checks and increased age limits for semi-automatic rifles have no chance in Texas. After Menendez’s comments, a bill to raise the age limit for some rifles saw some movement in the Texas House, but it still faces long odds.
  

      Despite Abbot’s repeated promises to focus on mental health, Texas has no red flag law – also known as an extreme risk protection order law – which would allow authorities to take weapons from a person thought to be in crisis.
  

      The gunman in this most recent mass shooting, Mauricio Garcia, was killed by a local police officer. He does appear to have a history of mental illness. A law enforcement source familiar with the investigation told CNN that Garcia served in the military for a brief period but was removed due to concerns about his mental health. 
  

      Garcia was also apparently wearing an “RWDS” insignia – short for “Right Wing Death Squad” – on his tactical vest, suggesting at least an affinity for extremist groups. That idea is reinforced by a social media presence in which authorities say he shared neo-Nazi and White supremacist-related posts. Read CNN’s full report about Garcia.
  

      Congress did pass legislation last year to encourage states to pass red flag laws, but Texas has not yet followed through. And with a patchwork of laws, even states that pass their own cannot stop weapons from crossing their borders.

53,Why the US expects a border surge and is deploying troops,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/02/politics/title-42-border-what-matters/index.html,"      The layer of duct tape that has been holding up US immigration policy will be ripped off, and nobody seems completely ready for what’s next:
  

      The surge of migrants is expected because Title 42, the Trump-era policy that allowed the government to quickly turn away certain migrants at the border during the Covid-19 pandemic, is expiring. 
  

      It was kept in place by courts and used by the Biden administration.
  

      Title 42 officially ends on May 11, when the Covid-19 public health emergency lapses.
  

      Encounters between US border agents and undocumented immigrants had fallen early this year but have recently increased. They are at around 7,000 per day at the moment and are expected to rise dramatically, despite a warning from the State Department and DHS about a new, more punitive policy related to border crossings.
  

      The additional 1,500 active-duty troops being dispatched for 90 days by the Pentagon will join around 2,500 National Guard troops already on the border. They are meant to act in strictly administrative roles and not to aid in law enforcement, according to CNN’s report.
  

      These deployments are not unprecedented in recent years, but this one is notable since it coincides with an expected surge of border encounters.
  

      The administration has tried to discourage migrants from simply crossing the border and promised that people apprehended will be turned away and potentially barred from reentry. 
  

      The US is working with Colombia and Guatemala to set up regional processing centers to allow migrants to apply to come to the US before they attempt the grueling journey through Central America and Mexico.
  

      “The idea is, of course, that people will not continue their journey over land,” a senior administration official told CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez recently. “The whole idea of regional processing centers is to give people a lawful, safe, regular way to enter the United States.”
  

      But there are already more than 36,000 migrants, according to estimates, camped along the border in northern Mexico waiting for the end of Title 42.
  

      The State Department and DHS have urged those people to use a mobile app to make an appointment at a port of entry rather than trying to cross the border.
  

      Once Title 42 lapses, the US will return to using what’s known as Title 8 authority to remove anyone who arrives at the border unlawfully and bar them from reentering the US for at least five years, a more punitive approach. 
  

      A major difference after Title 42 lapses is that asylum-seekers who cross the border without first applying for asylum will be removed under that Title 8 authority, along with a newly proposed regulation, according to the State Department. Immigration advocates are confounded since the Trump administration proposed a similar plan.
  

      The government has pledged to increase the number of refugees allowed into the US and is pushing applicants to use those regional centers rather than travel all the way to the border.
  

      There are also asylum-seekers already inside the US.
  

      CNN’s Rosa Flores recently reported from the streets of El Paso, Texas, where crowds of people had been moved from sleeping on the street to make way for a twice-daily run-through by the city’s sanitation services. El Paso has declared a state of emergency in anticipation of the end of Title 42. 
  

      Flores said it’s mostly men sleeping on the street and that families with children are crowding shelters that have been set up in the city.
  

      From border towns, asylum-seekers hope to get a ride closer to relatives or acquaintances who live in the country.
  

      CNN recently talked to a Haitian family – 28-year-old Dieuvena, her husband Banel and their 4-year-old son Matéo Sebastien – struggling to find a place to stay in Boston. After staying in a hospital, the family has had a hard time finding a place to sleep.
  

      Texas has been transporting thousands of migrants to cities like New York, Chicago and Washington, DC.
  

      New York City Mayor Eric Adams has asked the federal government to stop giving Federal Emergency Management Agency funds to the Texas border cities using federal dollars to rent buses and ship migrants farther north.
  

      More than 50,000 asylum-seekers have arrived since last spring, according to a separate report by CNN’s Alvarez, Mark Morales and Gregory Krieg.
  

      They wrote:
  

But what was originally seen as a stunt or political provocation – intended to expose what conservatives describe as hypocrisy among immigrant-friendly Democratic leaders – has mushroomed into a crisis for Adams, who is desperately seeking federal aid. Advocates’ anger over the treatment of the migrants by the city, which initially set up tent camps as shelters, is creating pressure from the left on a mayor who is now threatening budget cuts to everything from libraries to the fire department and Department of Homeless Services.


      Adams also accused Texas Gov. Greg Abbott of only sending migrants to cities with Black mayors.
  

      “Governor Abbott sent asylum seekers to NY – Black mayor; to Washington – Black mayor; to Houston – Black mayor; to Los Angeles – Black mayor; to Denver – Black mayor. He passed over thousands of cities to land here,” Adams said at a recent news conference on an unrelated topic. 
  

      “I cannot ignore the fact that Gov. Abbott sent migrants only to cities where there are Black mayors, and it’s undermining our cities,” he added.
  

      Abbott, unapologetic for targeting certain cities that pledged to be immigrant sanctuaries with busloads of migrants, has argued the larger problem is on the border.
  

      The men both want help from the federal government, but they have very different ideas about what that help would look like. 
  

      Adams wants the federal government to help deal with asylum-seekers already in the US in a more orderly and fair way. Abbott wants the federal government to repel people at the border.
  

      There’s a larger point here: Current immigration policy is about to change in a material way not because a reasoned debate led to legislation – Congress is not seriously debating immigration at the moment – but rather because the public health emergency is officially ending.
  

      One thing that would help the immigration policy is clarity, according to Ariel Ruiz Soto, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute.
  

      “Clearly there’s significant policy change that is needed at the US-Mexico border; one that actually starts with increasing and providing better assistance for US asylum claims, one that is more fair and transparent about who can come to the country and seek asylum in which ways,” he told CNN’s Rosemary Church.
  

      There’s also very clearly a need for better coordination between the local, state and federal governments about how to treat people already in the US.
  

      It’s a great irony of the US political debate that immigration drives such a visceral divide since the country needs immigrants – both to address labor shortages and to shore up the social safety net programs that are running out of funding.

54,Fresh January 6 convictions raise the stakes for Trump,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/politics/trump-january-6-proud-boys-convictions/index.html,"      But what about the next election?
  

      Thursday’s verdict only added to the intrigue surrounding the gravest legal and political unknown from the 2021 Capitol insurrection that hangs over the 2024 campaign: will Donald Trump, the president who inspired the uprising, face his own legal and political price?
  

      This is not simply vital to the question of whether justice applies equally to everyone in society, no matter how powerful they might be. It’s also fundamental to the historical accounting still unfolding over one of the most flagrant attacks on American democracy and may go some way to undermining Republican efforts to blur the truth of what happened on that terrible day.
  

Four Proud Boys members found guilty of seditious conspiracy 


      But the legal uncertainty facing Trump – who appears in jeopardy in multiple investigations springing from his election denialism and other alleged transgressions – comes with a related political question. Even if the ex-president is charged with trying to overthrow the core principle of democracy – the peaceful transfer of power – will it ultimately hurt his 2024 campaign?
  

      The former president is betting that it won’t. He’s spent two years denying the truth of January 6 and has anchored his 2024 campaign for a non-consecutive second term to the premise that he was illegally ousted from power in 2020. If the nascent Republican nominating contest is any guide, Trump’s legacy of disgrace is unlikely to scare off Republican primary voters, many of whom seem to be warming to him after his slow start. And that’s despite his indictment in a hush money case in New York. (He’s pleaded not guilty to charges of falsifying business records.)
  

President Joe Biden, however, has made a counter bet. The first scene of his reelection announcement video released last month showed smoke rising over the US Capitol and rioters with Trump flags. Whatever the liabilities of his own bid, including his advanced age, low approval ratings and an unpredictable economy, the current commander in chief is beseeching Americans not to trust their democracy to a predecessor who came close to overturning it in early 2021.
  

      Given the fraught situation, the Justice Department’s next moves will be hugely significant.
  

      “Today’s verdict makes clear the Justice Department will do everything in its power to defend the American people and American democracy,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said after prosecutors secured convictions against the Proud Boys extremists in a historic case Thursday.
  

      But Garland walked away from the cameras and didn’t take a question – presumably because he’s not yet ready to answer the one that is on the nation’s lips, about Trump. 
  

      In cases directly related to the 2020 election, the former president is being investigated by special counsel Jack Smith over his actions running up to the insurrection. He’s also waiting to find out whether he and his political cronies will be charged in an investigation in Fulton County, Georgia, over his attempt to steal Biden’s victory in the Peach State.
  

      Thursday’s Proud Boys convictions are among the most significant of hundreds of successful Justice Department prosecutions of people linked to the US Capitol riot. Five leaders and one associate of another extremist group – the Oath Keepers – were earlier found guilty of seditious conspiracy in separate cases. All of those convicted potentially face decades in jail. Nearly 600 rioters have been convicted and more than 235 have been sent to prison on lesser charges.
  

How 2020 election accountability could hit a 2024 roadblock


      This record bolsters Garland’s promise that the assault on US democracy would be punished. But it also begs the question why Trump, who inspired the rioters and has convinced millions of his supporters that he actually won an election he lost, has not faced similar accountability.
  

      “Who is the single most powerful person who Merrick Garland has charged in connection with January 6? Nobody,” said CNN legal analyst Elie Honig on Thursday, channeling frustration among some experts with the slow pace of investigations into Trump and his associates.
  

      So could the ex-president – who called a crowd to Washington on the day that the 2020 election was due to be certified in Congress, fired supporters up with lies about election fraud and told them to “fight like hell” before they marched on the Capitol – also be charged? And since prosecutors referred to the Proud Boys convicted on Thursday as “Trump’s army” and said that they appeared to see him as their leader and his rhetoric as a call to action, could he also be looking at a charge as serious as seditious conspiracy?
  

      “Donald Trump lit the flame. The Proud Boys were the flame,” former Rep. Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican, told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on “The Situation Room.”
  

      Seditious conspiracy, a charge that dates from the post-Civil War period, is rarely used and hard to prove. Prosecutors effectively had to show that two or more people had conspired to overthrow, put down or destroy by force the US government. They used a trove of text messages, video and other material to build the chain of conspiracy that convinced the jury.
  

      Using the same charge against Trump would be complicated unless the special counsel has amassed evidence that shows that the ex-president genuinely plotted with others to incite violence against the government when his vice president was inside the Capitol presiding over the certification of Biden’s victory. It won’t be enough to simply draw a line between Trump’s apparent incitement of the crowd to events that happened next.
  

      “The challenge whenever you are establishing a conspiracy is you have to have an agreement between two parties,” CNN legal analyst Elliot Williams said. “Finding an agreement between the former president and the people who were there on that day is just going to be exceptionally difficult.”
  

      Still, the defendants found guilty of seditious conspiracy on Thursday – longtime Proud Boys chairman Enrique Tarrio, Ethan Nordean, Joseph Biggs and Zachary Rehl – were also found guilty of a range of other charges, including three separate conspiracy charges, obstructing the Electoral College vote and tampering with evidence. So while a prosecution of Trump and his closest political associates over January 6 could be tough, it may not be impossible. In fact, Tarrio was not even on the Capitol grounds when the insurrection took place – a fact that could chill those in Trump’s camp.
  

      A lawyer for Rehl told CNN’s Katelyn Polantz after the verdict that what Trump did or didn’t do was of “no moment” to her or her client. She added, however: “But he was the one who called the rally and had everyone show up.”
  

      Any legal moves will take place in a highly sensitive political context. After all, the next election is unfolding while a former president and current presidential candidate is being investigated over alleged crimes by the Justice Department of his successor’s administration.
  

      The lesson of the ex-president’s career in business and politics is that he’s an expert at avoiding legal accountability and that scandals – any one of which would have ended a normal political career – seem to wash off his back.
  

      It’s fair to ask, however, whether that is now changing because his potential legal liability goes beyond cases related to the 2020 election.
  

      Smith is also pursuing a possible case of infringing the Espionage Act and obstruction in an investigation over classified documents Trump hoarded at Mar-a-Lago. In a possible sign of his increasing vulnerability on this matter, two Trump Organization executives were due to appear before a federal grand jury investigating the case Thursday, after CNN exclusively reported Smith is asking questions about the handling of surveillance footage from the Florida resort. And in another extraordinary drama that reflects the staggering legal clouds hanging over Trump – but that might also end up demonstrating the extent of his political impunity among his voters – a jury in a civil case is being asked to decide whether Trump raped former magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll in the mid 1990s and then defamed her. (Trump has denied all wrongdoing.)
  

      Both Biden and some of Trump’s potential 2024 primary opponents, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, have made the case overtly or implicitly that this catalog of suspicion – not to mention the chaos it could cause during the campaign and potentially in a second Trump term – is more than enough to disqualify him from the presidency. And after his loss in 2020 and the defeat of many of his hand-picked candidates in last fall’s midterms, there’s reason to believe a national electorate could again reject the former president because of his conduct, character and his ongoing obsession with the last presidential election.
  

      It’s a different story among the GOP base, which is still loyal to him. In an NBC News poll released last week, 68% of Republican primary voters agreed with the statement that investigations against him “are a politically motivated attempt to stop Trump. No other candidate is like him, we must support him.” 
  

      The ex-president, who will appear in a CNN town hall in New Hampshire on Wednesday, has made some effective moves in seeking to wound DeSantis, his former protégé, who trails him in early polling. There’s plenty of time for the race to change – and for DeSantis, who hasn’t yet launched a bid, to overcome some rocky moments in recent weeks. But the ex-president’s team looks to be running a more disciplined operation than his chaotic White House often did. 
  

      Trump’s demagogic and anti-democratic rhetoric at his campaign rallies, however, refutes any notion that he would be less threatening to American democracy in a second term.
  

      But that’s a direct appeal to his followers. So for now, at least with GOP primary voters, what doesn’t convict Trump, makes him stronger.

55,‘Nationalism’ redefines the American right,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/06/politics/nationalism-conservatism-what-matters/index.html,"      The American right wing, long identified with the conservative movement, is increasingly latching onto something very different – nationalism – which frightens some students of history but is inspiring to a new breed of Republicans.
  

      Some recent examples:
  

      These moments, which seem unremarkable to a regular consumer of news, remind us that the Republican Party has been struggling for decades to reconcile its internal partnership of nationalists and conservatives. If you just woke up to American politics in the past 30 years, the two terms seem synonymous, but they haven’t always been.
  

      So what is a nationalist and what is a conservative? And does it matter if we use these terms interchangeably? 
  

      First, a quick definition: When academics use “nationalism” by itself, it’s the concept that some kind of identity matters more than philosophy. That can be a place, an ethnicity or a religion. In current US politics, we typically see that identity with Christian nationalism or White nationalism.
  

      Whether you throw all the way back to the philosopher Edmund Burke or start with former President Ronald Reagan, conservatism has typically meant a resistance to radical change and a faith in caution, especially when it comes to government’s role in a citizen’s life.
  

      Many conservatives bristle at being lumped in with the very idea of nationalism, even without add-ons like “Christian” or “White.” Their version of conservatism is irrespective of place. 
  

      Former Heritage Foundation Executive Vice President Kim Holmes argued in 2019 that “American conservatives have argued that one of the great things about America was that it was different from all other countries. Different from all other nationalisms.” 
  

      Trump flipped that more open principle of conservatism around when he declared himself to be a “nationalist” in 2018. Most of his policy proposals as president were focused on putting “America First.” 
  

      For Holmes, American identity is “based on a universal creed … grounded in America’s founding principles.” Holmes sees kindred spirits and a shared struggle with conservatives elsewhere in the world who might share those principles.
  

      Conservativism as a concept wasn’t even partisan in the 20th century. Joe Biden embraced the term during his first term in the US Senate, telling Kitty Kelley of the Washingtonian in 1974, “When it comes to civil rights and civil liberties, I’m a liberal but that’s it. I’m really quite conservative on most other issues.”
  

      Over time, the term has evolved. As Lee Drutman, a political scientist at the think tank New America and author of “Breaking the Two-Party Doom Loop: The Case for Multiparty Democracy in America,” told me, “Once upon a time, there was a consistent meaning, but now you can be a national security conservative, an economic conservative, a social conservative. It’s become more of an identity.”
  

      Holmes said when conservatives lose confidence in the strength of their philosophy, it risks becoming an identity. “They think that traditional fusionist conservatism and the American exceptionalism idea are not strong enough. These ideas are not muscular enough. They want something stronger to stand up to the universal claims of globalism and progressivism that they believe are anti-American.”
  

      Such a partnership between nationalism and conservatism, argues Angie Maxwell, a political science professor at the University of Arkansas, was forged in the middle of the 20th century when the Republican Party worked to break the hold the Democratic Party had on the South since the Reconstruction to the late 20th century.
  

      “We see the Republican Party try to adopt the specific brand of Southern White conservatism,” she said. 
  

      Maxwell said while the party was divided over the strategy, various Republican campaigns noted they could pick up voters by emphasizing Christian values, anti-feminism and racial resentment. In the 1960s, she noted, sentiments on those three dynamics would split evenly among members of both parties, while today those views are disproportionately felt by Republican voters.
  

      Which leads us to today, where Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia, says plainly, “We need to be the party of nationalism and I’m a Christian, and I say it proudly, we should be Christian nationalists.”
  

      “There’s nothing conservative about Marjorie Taylor Greene, if conservative means we should tread with caution, we should not blow things up, we should have restraint and humility,” argued Drutman, harkening back to Burke, who many consider the founder of modern conservatism. “In some ways, (former President Barack) Obama is much more of a Burkean conservative.”
  

      Drutman noted that some forms of nationalism are benign: “You can argue that’s what’s great about America – that we have a diverse and pluralist society, (that) America is the greatest nation in the world because we welcome everyone.”
  

      What concerns Drutman is Greene’s kind of identity-driven nationalism. 
  

      “What is changed in our politics is the extent to which our political divisions have led us to see competing viewpoints as illegitimate. For half the country to treat the other half as if they were a threat to the country,” Drutman said. “Maybe there are some issues where we should be more conservative. They become dangerous when their adherents deny that there is legitimate opposition.”
  

      That also concerned Holmes, writing in 2019 before Greene was elected, when he warned, “Nationalism is devoid of a common idea or principle of government except that a people or a nation-state can be almost anything. It can be fascist, it can be authoritarian, it can be totalitarian, or it can be democratic.”

56,More green investment hasn’t softened red resistance on climate,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/02/politics/green-investment-red-states-climate-crisis-fault-lines/index.html,"      That stark contrast has dashed a central hope and expectation among environmentalists: the belief that more economic opportunity in red places would mean less political opposition from Republicans to the transition toward a clean energy economy that scientists say is necessary to reduce the risk of catastrophic global climate change. The persistence of GOP opposition to that transition underscores the limits of economic incentives to overcome ideological inclinations – and points toward years of pitched partisan conflict that could make it virtually impossible for the US to set a consistent course on climate policy.
  

      This dynamic was encapsulated last week when virtually every House Republican voted, in the party’s debt ceiling plan, to repeal the clean energy incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act Democrats passed last year, even though those incentives have already triggered investments in 72 Republican-held districts, including over two dozen districts that have received massive investments of $1 billion or more in new plants or expansions of existing facilities. It’s also apparent in decisions by Republican state attorneys general from states that are among the top beneficiaries of new clean energy investments and jobs to launch a flurry of lawsuits and other legal proceedings against proposals from President Joe Biden’s administration to speed the transition toward a low-carbon economy.
  

      This opposition contravenes the traditional assumption that politicians almost always support the economic interests creating opportunity for their constituents. With growing boldness, Republicans and conservative activists are framing defense of fossil fuels and skepticism of clean energy alternatives as a form of culture war – with the transition to wind, solar and electric vehicles taking its place alongside transgender rights, “woke” indoctrination in the classroom or restrictions on gun ownership as an example of “coastal elites” trying to erase traditional American values.
  

      In opposing measures to promote clean energy even in places benefiting from new investments to produce it, “Republicans believe – and the next election will help us see whether this is a good strategy or not – that culture war is going to be better to help them win than talking about jobs and the economy,” said Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Program on Climate Change Communication at Yale University.
  

      In all these ways, climate change has become another fissure along the central fault line in modern American politics. Like attitudes toward demographic and cultural change, perspectives on shifting the nation’s energy mix from its historic reliance on fossil fuels toward low-carbon alternatives now pit the Democratic “coalition of transformation” that largely embraces the way America is changing on every front against the Republican “coalition of restoration” that resists it. 
  

      For many Republicans, the Inflation Reduction Act’s sweeping provisions to encourage carbon-free energy sources aren’t “a bipartisan domestic energy agenda,” even though those incentives are channeling substantial jobs and investment to red places, said Robert McNally, a Republican energy consultant and former White House energy adviser for President George W. Bush. “This is a left wing, coastal ‘let’s change the world by having the federal government intervene at a time of high inflation kind of thing.’ When a Republican member does the pros and cons, it’s not like they don’t see the pros, but they see a lot of cons.”
  

      Republican-leaning states, as I’ve written, are generally more integrated into the existing fossil fuel economy than blue-leaning places. Trump won 20 of the 21 states that emit the most carbon from their energy sector per each dollar of economic activity, mostly states between the coasts that are either big producers of fossil fuels (Wyoming, West Virginia, Texas) or big consumers of it to power robust agricultural and manufacturing sectors (Iowa, Nebraska, Ohio, Indiana). Biden in turn won 19 of the 21 states with the least emissions, most of them coastal states that produce little oil, gas or coal and have transitioned more rapidly into the post-industrial economy of services and high-tech jobs, such as Massachusetts, New York, Virginia, and California. Representation in the House and Senate, and control of state governments, follow these same tracks, with Republicans dominating the high-emitting states and Democrats dominating those with lower emissions. Oil and gas companies now routinely direct about four-fifths of their campaign contributions toward Republicans in Congress.
  

      But the energy transition now underway is remaking this picture. Red places are among the clear winners in the emerging clean energy economy. Of the five states that produced the most wind-generated electricity in 2022, according to federal statistics, four are solidly red: Texas, Iowa, Oklahoma and Kansas; Illinois is the sole exception. Big solar generating states include Texas and Florida, as well as Arizona, Georgia and Nevada – places where Republicans control the state legislature, the governorship or both.
  

      The Inflation Reduction Act that passed last year on a party line vote is further diffusing these opportunities, though no Republican legislators in either the House or the Senate voted for it.
  

      Overall, as of March 31, companies have announced “191 new clean energy projects in small towns and bigger cities nationwide totaling $242.81 billion in new investments,” according to a recent report by the environmental advocacy group Climate Power. Those investments are projected to create some 142,000 jobs, the group calculated. Of the 10 states that have received the most announced clean energy projects, the group found, only two are safely Democratic (New York and California.) The rest are either battleground states (Michigan, Arizona and Georgia) or Republican-leaning (Texas, Ohio, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee).
  

      The red tilt on investment is similarly pronounced at the congressional district level. In another study, Climate Power found that over half of all the new clean energy projects announced since the bill’s passage have been located in Republican-held congressional districts. The Republican district projects account, stunningly, for nearly four-fifths of the total clean energy investments that have been announced. The group found that two dozen House Republicans hold seats where clean energy companies have committed to investments of $1 billion or more since the passage of the IRA. The district that has received the most investment is held by New York Republican Rep. Brandon Williams (whose New York seat is the site of a massive plant that will manufacture semiconductors for EVs) and the district projected to receive the most jobs is held by Nevada Republican Rep. Mark Amodei (which has attracted four separate projects). A South Korean company is building a $2.5 billion solar panel manufacturing facility in the Georgia district of far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.
  

      Many reasons may explain why so much of the new clean energy investment has flowed into red places. Most important may be that Republican states and districts tilt more toward rural areas where space for large manufacturing facilities is easier to acquire. In those states, taxes are typically lower and state regulations more lenient as well. Some companies are also attracted to the non-union environment in most red states.
  

      Whatever the motivation for the companies, environmentalists have hoped that channeling more economic benefits from the energy transition into red places would soften the opposition of Republicans toward deemphasizing fossil fuels. The model some cite is how the spread of defense contracts across virtually every congressional district maximizes support for the Pentagon budget. 
  

      Lori Lodes, executive director of Climate Power, sees that precedent as critical to sustaining a long-term federal effort behind promoting clean energy. “What we need it to become is the defense authorization act, where every single congressional district has a piece of it – and it can’t be undone and we are set on this path of reaching our goals because of how diffuse it is,” she says.
  

      But establishing those political roots, she acknowledges, will take time, and in the near term, the torrent of new investment has not diminished Republican resistance. If anything, as Biden leans into measures to accelerate the energy transition, Republicans are stiffening their opposition. 
  

      “The harder one side pushes, the harder the other way the other side wants to push back,” said Heather Reams, president of Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, a conservative group that supports action on climate change.
  

      Last week, almost every House Republican voted for the sweeping bill to raise the debt ceiling that included the repeal of the extensive incentives in the IRA for both producers and consumers to shift to clean energy sources. Earlier this year, every House and Senate Republican, under an act allowing Congress to challenge federal regulations, voted to overturn a Department of Labor rule that would allow pension fund managers to consider so-called ESG (environmental, social and corporate governance) goals in making investment decisions – which is considered one important way to encourage more investment in green industries.
  

      Biden vetoed that change, but a coalition of Republican state attorneys general are still seeking to block the regulation in court. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a likely 2024 GOP presidential candidate, recently organized a coalition of 19 Republican governors to fight such ESG measures, which he derides as “woke capitalism.”
  

      West Virginia’s Republican Attorney General Patrick Morrisey has hinted that when the federal Environmental Protection Agency completes its proposed fuel economy regulations requiring a rapid shift toward electric vehicles, GOP AGs will sue to overturn that, too. No one would be surprised if such a coalition of Republican-controlled states sues as well to block the regulations the Biden EPA is developing to reduce carbon emissions from power plants. (Such a coalition successfully sued to block former President Barack Obama’s regulations on the same topic.) And it seems inevitable that whenever the EPA completes both its fuel economy and power plant regulations that congressional Republicans will attempt to override them as well. From Republicans, predicts McNally, there will be “complete and total opposition on all fronts” to the coming Biden climate regulations. “It will be kitchen sink – everything will be going at it.”
  

      Reams is cautiously optimistic that if Republicans obtained unified control of the White House and Congress in 2025, they would preserve at least some of the IRA’s clean energy incentives as part of an “all of the above” strategy to encourage more domestic production of both fossil fuels and low-carbon sources. But McNally, in a view shared from across the political spectrum by Lodes, predicts that if Republicans win unified control, they will “gut” the IRA clean energy incentives that they voted to eliminate last week. “Ninety-eight percent of this is going to go,” he says.
  

      When I reached out to several House Republicans last week to ask why they voted to rescind the IRA incentives although their districts have received big clean energy investments, most either did not respond or refused to comment. (In the latter camp was Utah Rep. John Curtis, who chairs the Conservative Climate Caucus and whose district has received $11 billion in clean energy investments, according to Climate Power.)
  

      One who did respond was Amodei, the Nevada Republican. He exemplifies the depth of Republican skepticism to the Democratic agenda to combat climate change. His northern Nevada district contains not only a massive (and expanding) Tesla plant, but also a factory being built by another battery company, Redwood Materials. Between them, the Redwood plant and Tesla expansion are expected to create 4,600 permanent manufacturing jobs as well as many construction jobs, according to news accounts.
  

      Yet Amodei voted last week to repeal all the IRA’s incentives to encourage more production and consumption of electric vehicles. In an interview, he said the pace at which Biden and Democrats want to transition transportation toward EVs was unrealistic. “Do I think electricity is the future? Absolutely,” Amodei said. But he added, “even with all these billions of dollars being poured into these things in the form of subsidies and penalties” the rate at which Biden hopes to shift Americans into electric vehicles “borders on suicidal.” 
  

      Moreover, he asserted that Nevada companies are largely being excluded from the construction jobs generated by the big plant expansions in his district, and that the bigger concern for most constituents he represents is the risk that the IRA’s increased spending will fuel inflation. “The benefits” of the bill, he says, “I don’t think outweigh the negative stuff in terms of debt, inflation and oh, by the way, how much really came to Nevada?”
  

      Amodei is one of the Republican members that Climate Power and the League of Conservation Voters have already targeted with ads criticizing their votes. Lodes says his claim that Nevada residents aren’t benefiting from the new jobs in his district “just doesn’t hold water.” She says the group’s challenge is to make clear to voters in the Republican districts benefiting from clean energy investments that their Representatives voted to repeal the incentives encouraging that spending. “The case we will have to make to voters is that every single one of these MAGA extremists put their agenda ahead of their constituents,” she says.
  

      That argument could prove effective in some swing districts, particularly those with a large number of college-educated voters. But most House Republicans represent solidly GOP-leaning areas. And demand for action against climate change has remained minimal inside the GOP coalition. Leiserowitz says that in Yale’s polling, only a very small percentage of even moderate Republicans cite climate as an important issue for government to address and that the share of all Republicans who support developing more clean energy sources is actually dropping. Republican voters are far more likely to say they support more domestic drilling for oil and gas. The vast majority of Republican voters even say they will never consider buying an electric vehicle, according to a recent Gallup poll. Democrats mostly take the opposite positions, placing far greater priority on climate change as a problem and expressing much more interest in changing not only public policy but also their personal behavior to combat it.
  

      Reams says that disparity has created a striking dynamic, with Republican-leaning communities producing the clean energy favored by Democratic-leaning consumers: “You have a phenomenon of red supply for blue demand,” she says. 
  

      Like many environmentalists to her left, Reams believes that as the clean energy industries become more “ingrained” in GOP-leaning areas, “more Republicans will say ‘I can’t repeal that.’” The historical behavior of members of Congress says she’s right; but those precedents may no longer apply.
  

      Over time, more clean energy investments and jobs in Republican-leaning places should make the case for transition more compelling. Likewise, even in those red areas, more consumers may also experience benefits from renewable power sources or the cost savings of operating electric vehicles. “Clean energy, electric vehicles, all the things associated with these things are going to become part of normal life in America,” says Leiserowitz. The result is that people “will ask, ‘How can you be against something when everybody is doing it?’”
  

      But all these traditional dynamics could be offset if clean energy continues to get pulled into the right’s culture war case against “woke” elites. Across a panoramic range of issues – from abortion, LGBTQ rights and guns to classroom censorship and book bans – Republicans, especially in red states, are looking to impose the cultural values of their predominantly conservative electoral coalition against what they consider liberal efforts to uproot the US from its traditions. So long as Republican voters are convinced to see the clean energy transition as part of that threat, even gleaming new factories and fat new paychecks may not much soften the party’s sweeping resistance to climate action.

0,"Sudan peace talks make progress, mediation source says: Reuters",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/middleeast/sudan-armed-forces-rapid-support-forces-peace-talks-intl/index.html,"      Clashes between the Sudanese Army and the paramilitary Rapid Support forces first erupted in mid-April, killing hundreds and injuring thousands. 
  

      Weeks after the fighting broke out, the leaders of Sudan’s army (SAF) and the paramilitary group RSF agreed to send representatives to the Saudi city of Jeddah for “pre-negotiation talks” mediated by the US and Saudi Arabia.
  

      Previous ceasefires between the parties have not yielded an end to the fighting, which has left the country on the brink of civil war and a massive humanitarian catastrophe. 
  

      At the heart of the violence are two men vying for dominance: Sudan’s military ruler and head of the army Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (widely known as Hemedti), the country’s deputy and head of the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group.
  

      Until recently, the two were allies who worked together to topple ousted Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir in 2019 and played a pivotal role in the military coup in 2021. But tensions arose during negotiations to integrate the RSF into the country’s military as part of plans to restore civilian rule.

1,Wagner boss fumes that Russian brigade ‘fled’ from Bakhmut area,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/europe/prizoghin-bakhmut-russia-ukraine-losses-intl-cmd/index.html,"      The remarks are the latest in a series of public criticisms from him of Moscow’s Ministry of Defense for the faltering invasion of Ukraine – and, in particular, the failure to capture the city of Bakhmut. But while Prigozhin has frequently poured scorn on the Russian military and its leadership, he has not previously accused Russian units of running from battle and allowing Ukrainian forces to recapture territory.
  

      Prigozhin said the 72nd brigade “just ran the hell out of there.”
  

      Responding to questions from a Russian media outlet, Prigozhin said: “There is a serious risk of encirclement of PMC Wagner in Bakhmut as a result of the failure of the flanks. The flanks are already cracking and falling through.”
  

      “At the moment, within the city of Bakhmut, there is only Wagner PMC, there are no other units. Outside Bakhmut [there is] only the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation. PMC Wagner is not there,” he said.
  

      Bakhmut is the site of a months-long assault by Russian forces, including Wagner mercenaries, that has driven thousands from their homes and left the area devastated. But despite the vast amounts of manpower Russia has poured into capturing the city – using tactics that have been compared to a “meat grinder” – they have been unable to take total control, and on Wednesday suffered heavy losses in the area.
  

      Prigozhin said despite pledges made by the Defense Ministry, his men had not been issued with anything like the required ammunition in recent days. 
  

      “Until now, ammunition has been filtered to a minimum…PMC Wagner continues the offensive in Bakhmut and is awaiting a decision on the issuance of ammunition and weapons in the required quantity,” he said.
  

      “In the absence of ammunition, the ‘meat grinder’ will work in the opposite direction: the Armed Forces of Ukraine will destroy PMC Wagner.” 
  

      In his latest comments, he blamed what he called “internal competition” for reducing supplies to Wagner.
  

      Prigozhin also questioned the value of capturing Bakhmut, claiming that the city “has no strategic importance.”
  

Putin tried to project strength, but Moscow Victory Day parade revealed only his isolation


      Separately, a prominent Russian military blogger, Anastasiya Kashevarova, has reported a complete lack of communication in the Bakhmut area between Wagner and the 72nd Brigade. Kashevarova said she had been near Bakhmut and noted that Wagner had pulled out of one flank to focus on another area without informing the 72nd.
  

      In turn the 72nd had no infantry in the area to help in its defense.
  

      She wrote on Telegram: “The 72nd has a ban on working with the ‘orchestra’ [Wagner] and Wagner is too proud.”
  

      Often, she added, a brigade does not know who is on its right or left. “There is no single command that would be respected by all without exception, ” she added. “Complete disunity of the front…the enemy is using it.”

2,SpaceX and startup Vast hope to put the world’s first private space station in orbit,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/world/spacex-vast-private-space-station-launch-scn/index.html,"      Vast — a California-based startup and one of the newest entrants in the world of privatized spaceflight — plans to use a SpaceX rocket to launch what it hopes to be the world’s first commercial space station and ferry passengers to and from the orbiting outpost.
  

      It’s not clear how much the agreement, announced by Vast on Wednesday, will cost. Company leadership declined to comment on the matter to CNN. Nor is it clear how much a trip to the proposed space station would cost visitors, which could include professional astronauts or tourists.
  

      Jed McCaleb, the founder and CEO of Vast who previously made a fortune in the cryptocurrency business, said in a statement that the company is “thrilled to embark on this journey of launching the world’s first commercial space station, Haven-1, and its first crew, Vast-1.”
  

      McCaleb said he is investing $300 million of his own money into the effort, and he does not plan to seek outside investment for Vast until the company has its proposed space station built and can generate revenue. He added that he acknowledges the overall project will likely cost him more than $300 million.  
  

      It is not certain that Vast will indeed become the first company to put a private space station in orbit. Vast says it’s aiming for a launch date as early as August 2025. Developing a space station, however, is an exceedingly complex endeavor, requiring extensive testing and key technology such as life support systems.
  

      McCaleb said Vast will have an advantage because it can leverage the life support systems already developed for SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft, which the company plans to use to carry passengers to its space station. 
  

      Vast will equip its Haven-1 space station with the necessary consumables — such as oxygen and other life-sustaining materials — but the company won’t have to develop a life support system from scratch, McCaleb told CNN.
  

      Other companies — including several with backing from NASA — are also working to develop private space stations. NASA, along with its global partners, is seeking to use a privately developed space station to replace the aging International Space Station, which has been continuously inhabited in low-Earth orbit since 2000. 
  

Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin wants to build a tourism space station nearly as big as the ISS


      The Biden-Harris administration and officials in Canada, Japan and participating countries of the European Space Agency authorized the ISS to stay in operation through 2030. But the other key partner on the International Space Station, Russia, has said it will only guarantee participation through 2028.
  

      It’s not clear how much of the $300 million McCaleb has allocated to the Haven-1 project will go to SpaceX for launch services. Vast did not share financial details about its agreement with the company.
  

      “The Dragon team and the team and leadership (at SpaceX) really want to build a Falcon 9-based space station,” said Max Haot, Vast’s president. Haot led the aerospace company Launcher before it was acquired by Vast in February. “So we’re very, very aligned.”
  

      Vast’s simple, single-structure Haven-1 space station will be able to launch atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, the workhorse vehicle that SpaceX has been launching for more than a decade.
  

      After the spacecraft is sent into orbit, SpaceX would provide training to four members of the as-yet-unnamed crew for a mission dubbed Vast-1. 
  

      “Vast is selling up to four crewed seats on the inaugural mission to Haven-1,” the company said in a news release. “Expected customers include domestic and international space agencies and private individuals involved in science and philanthropic projects.”
  

      Initially, the company plans for Haven-1 to operate independently, free-floating in Earth’s orbit. Later, the company plans to attach the spacecraft as a module to a larger space station.
  

      Vast said its ultimate goal is to create a massive orbiting space station with artificial gravity that could be launched atop a SpaceX Starship vehicle, a rocket still in the development stages that exploded midair during its inaugural test flight in April.

3,Hundreds of rockets fired at Israel amid deadly IDF airstrikes in Gaza,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/middleeast/israel-gaza-airstrikes-islamic-jihad-intl/index.html,"      The latest violence comes a day after Israeli military airstrikes killed three leaders of the Palestinian militant group and 10 other Palestinian men, women and children in Gaza and led to threats of retaliation.
  

      Israel has been bombarding the Islamic Jihad’s operatives and infrastructure, using unmanned drones for surveillance as it monitors militant preparations to propel rockets, IDF chief spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said Wednesday.
  

      At least six Palestinians were killed in Wednesday’s airstrikes, the Ministry of Health in Gaza said, revising down its earlier count.
  

      Hamas, the Palestinian militant movement that runs Gaza, issued a statement Wednesday strongly suggesting that its forces were releasing rockets towards Israel, shortly after the IDF said firmly it believed Hamas was not doing so.
  

      “The Palestinian resistance with all its factions, led by the Nasser Salah al-Din Brigades, is participating now in a unified manner by teaching the enemy a lesson that it will not forget and confirming that Palestinian blood is not cheap,” said the statement, issued by Muhammad al-Buraim, an official in the joint resistance committees in Palestine.
  

      The statement appeared designed to reject an assertion by IDF chief spokesman Hagari that the IDF saw only Islamic Jihad, not Hamas, firing rockets.
  

      Nearly 500 rockets were fired from Gaza towards Israel in the recent barrage, according to the IDF, as of 9:30 p.m. local time. Of those, 153 were intercepted by Israeli missile defenses and 107 fell short, landing in Gaza.
  

      The IDF said fighter jets and helicopters targeted over 40 rocket and mortar shells launchers belonging to Islamic Jihad terrorist across the Gaza Strip, adding that it is continuing to target launchers and additional posts belonging to the militant organization.
  

      Civilians in Israel have been asked to act according to the special instructions posted on the National Emergency Portal.
  

      Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top officials Wednesday downplayed the idea that a ceasefire with Islamic Jihad was imminent, with Netanyahu saying: “The campaign is not over yet.”
  

      National Security Council chair Tzachi Hanegbi said that rumors of a ceasefire were “premature,” while Defense Minister Yoav Gallant struck a slightly more optimistic note, saying: “I hope we’ll bring it to an end soon, but we’re ready for the option that it will be prolonged.”
  

      Over half a million Israelis were in or near shelters, the IDF spokesman Hagari said just after 2 p.m. local time (7 a.m. ET) on Wednesday.
  

      International leaders have condemned the hostilities. The United Nations Secretary-General urged all parties to exercise “maximum restraint” over the escalation of violence in Gaza, a statement by Farhan Haq, deputy spokesperson for the Secretary-General, said on Wednesday.
  

      “The Secretary General condemns the civilian loss of life, including that of children and women, which he views as unacceptable and must stop immediately,” the statement said.  
  

      “Israel must abide by its obligations under international humanitarian law, including the proportional use of force and taking all feasible precautions to spare civilians and civilian objects in the conduct of military operations. “
  

      The statement continued to say the Secretary-General also condemns the “indiscriminate launch” of rockets from Gaza into Israel, adding it “violates international humanitarian law and puts at risk both Palestinian and Israeli civilians.”    
  

      Qatar has been engaged in “intensive and continuous calls” to stop Israel’s “brutal aggression” on the Gaza Strip to avoid “more losses,” the spokesperson for Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs Majed Al-Ansari said in a statement on Wednesday.
  

      Meanwhile, Egyptian state-affiliated XtraNews said there are “intensive efforts” to reach a ceasefire in Gaza, citing Egyptian sources, without clarifying which parties have been communicated with. The news was carried on Egyptian state newspaper’s Al Ahram’s online website.
  

      Hamas said in a statement that the head of its political bureau, Ismail Haniya, spoke with officials from Egypt, Qatar and the UN.
  

      The Ministry of Health in Gaza said one person was killed in Wednesday’s attack. It named him as Muhammad Yusuf Saleh Abu Ta’ima, 25, and said he was killed in the bombing east of Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip.
  

      A CNN producer in Gaza reported explosions in Khan Younis, Rafah and northern Gaza. 
  

      Shortly after, he saw at least six rockets fired from Gaza towards Israel. Sirens warning of incoming rockets sounded in the southern Israeli cities of Sderot and Ashkelon and the Lachish area, all near the Gaza Strip, the Israel Defense Forces said. Sirens later sounded in Tel Aviv, Israel’s main city on the Mediterranean coast, warning of potential incoming rocket fire.
  

      Several locations in Israel suffered direct hits by rockets from Gaza, authorities said, but there were no immediate reports of casualties. A rocket landed near buildings and caused extensive damage in Ashkelon, pictures distributed by Israel Fire & Rescue Authority showed. A building in Kibbutz Nir Am also was hit, and a rocket landed in the garden of a house in Sderot.
  

      One of the three Islamic Jihad commanders killed on Tuesday was working on capabilities to launch rockets from the West Bank toward Israel, IDF chief spokesman Hagari said at the time.
  

      Rockets have never been fired from the West Bank into Israel.
  

      Islamic Jihad confirmed three of its commanders were killed in the overnight operation along with their wives and children.
  

      The commanders killed were Jihad Shaker Al-Ghannam, secretary of the Military Council in the al Quds Brigades; Khalil Salah al Bahtini, commander of the Northern Region in the al Quds Brigades; and Ezzedine, one of the leaders of the military wing of the al Quds Brigades in the West Bank, the group said.
  

Prominent Palestinian detainee Khader Adnan dies in Israeli prison after 87-day hunger strike


      Hagari said the operation had been planned since last Tuesday, when Islamic Jihad fired more than 100 rockets toward Israel following the death of its former spokesman while on hunger strike in an Israeli prison.
  

      But, the IDF did not have the “operational conditions” until overnight Tuesday.
  

      The IDF launched a further strike on Tuesday, saying its air force targeted “a terrorist squad” belonging to Islamic Jihad in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip.
  

      The Palestinian ministry of health in Gaza said two people were killed and two others injured in that attack east of Khan Younis, although they have yet to identify them, bringing the death toll in Gaza to 15 on Tuesday.

4,Pakistan on edge as ex-PM Imran Khan charged with corruption,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/asia/pakistan-imran-khan-arrest-wednesday-intl-hnk/index.html,"      The charge relates to the sale of gifts sent to him by foreign leaders while in office. His lawyer told CNN Khan rejects the indictment.
  

      Khan has alleged he was “tortured and beaten all night” while in detention, his lawyer told CNN, adding that the former leader had “bruises on his head” when he met him at the court hearing. 
  

      Khan was arrested on Tuesday in another corruption case, where he is accused of the illegal acquisition of land and construction for a university. 
  

      His lawyer told CNN that Khan has been placed on “physical remand” for eight days following the court hearing, for the charge brought on Tuesday. 
  

      His arrest has turbocharged an already tense showdown between the country’s powerful military and his supporters, who hit the streets and sparked unprecedented scenes as angry crowds broke into and vandalized the homes of army personnel. 
  

      Pakistan’s military described the protests that followed Khan’s arrest a “dark chapter” in the country’s history, warning that any further attacks “on the army, including all law enforcement agencies, military and state installations and properties, will be severely retaliated against,” in a statement Wednesday. 
  

      Three of Khan’s supporters died in clashes in the city of Peshawar and nearly 30 others were injured, a hospital spokesperson said. Clashes continued Wednesday with hundreds of Khan’s supporters storming the headquarters of the national broadcaster Radio Pakistan in Peshawar, according to a CNN journalist at the scene. 
  

      Photos from Peshawar’s streets showed security forces firing teargas at crowds, some of whom used slingshots.
  

      Police said nearly 1,000 Khan supporters had been arrested in Punjab province after 25 police vehicles and more than 14 government buildings were set on fire, Reuters reported.
  

      Authorities in three of Pakistan’s four provinces have also imposed an emergency order banning all gatherings, Reuters added.
  

      Ahsan Iqbal, Pakistan’s minister for planning and development, told reporters on Wednesday that Khan had “chosen a path of spreading anarchy, chaos and destruction” to “protect himself from accountability.” 
  

      “I want to assure there is no political vendetta,” he added.
  

      Wednesday’s hearing took place in the police station rather than a court to “keep him away from the public”, police said.
  

      Video before Khan’s arrest on Tuesday showed paramilitary forces breaking a window to get to the politician as he watched impassively at the unfolding chaos. Khan was then led into a vehicle surrounded by dozens of security officers and escorted away. 
  

      In a pre-recorded statement released on YouTube by Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) political party after his arrest, the former prime minister said he was “detained on incorrect charges” and told his supporters “the time has come for all of you to come and struggle for your rights.”
  

      “I have always followed the law. I am being apprehended so that I can’t follow my political path for this country’s fundamental rights and for me to obey this corrupt government of crooks which has been hoisted on us,” he said in the video.
  

      Violent protests broke out in several cities that afternoon. 
  

      Khan supporters armed with sticks broke into the military’s headquarters in the city of Rawalpindi, just outside the capital, chanting in support of the former leader. 
  

      Protesters also blocked one of the main thoroughfares into Islamabad, throwing stones and pulling down street signs. A police vehicle was set ablaze, resulting in police retaliating with tear gas. 
  

      Meanwhile, in the southwestern city of Quetta, a Khan supporter was shot and killed by police at a protest, according to a CNN journalist at the scene.
  

      Authorities blocked mobile internet services shortly after in a bid to quell the chaos, disrupting access to Twitter, Facebook and YouTube in the nation of 270 million. Private schools across the country were ordered shut on Wednesday, according to the Private Schools Association.
  

      At least 43 protesters were arrested in Islamabad Tuesday, the city’s police said on Twitter. 
  

      Syed Baqir Sajjad, a Pakistan Fellow at the Wilson Center in Washington, said that although previous Pakistani leaders had faced arrest, and politicians had in the past challenged the military’s dominance, Khan’s significant public support made this situation “unique.”
  

      “The risks faced by Pakistan in this situation are numerous,” he said. “The military’s image as a unifying force and the guardian of the state has been seriously challenged, which has led to a loss of public trust in the institution. This, in turn, could lead to instability and social unrest.”
  

      Khan was ousted in a parliamentary no-confidence vote last year and has since led a popular campaign against the current government led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, accusing it of colluding with the military to remove him from office.
  

      The former star cricketer turned populist politician denies the charges leveled against him, instead accusing Sharif and the military of playing a political game. The military and Sharif – who was recently in the United Kingdom after attending the coronation of the British monarch – deny Khan’s accusations. 
  

      The tensions have brought Pakistan, a nuclear-armed country of some 220 million people that has for decades grappled with political instability, into unknown territory and have often boiled over into violence.
  

      Last November, Khan survived a shooting at a political rally, in what his party called an assassination attempt. 


      And in March, chaos erupted outside Khan’s Lahore home after hundreds of his supporters challenged police and paramilitary troops who had arrived to escort him away. Officers were forced to suspend the operation after protests turned violent – one of multiple unsuccessful attempts by police to arrest Khan.
  

      Khan’s claims have struck a chord with a young population in a country where anti-establishment feelings are common, and are being fueled by a rising cost of living crisis as soaring inflation makes ordinary goods increasingly unaffordable.
  

      “This has put increased pressure on the military establishment, which is feeling the heat more this time,” said Sajjad. “The intensity and consistency of Imran Khan’s attacks on the military, especially after being ousted from office last year, are unprecedented.”
  

      Amid the crisis, the government has so far failed to reach an agreement with the International Monetary Fund to restart a $6.5 billion loan program that has stalled since November, in an effort to keep the economy afloat.
  

      The political upheaval appears to have bolstered Khan’s popularity. Last year, his PTI party won local elections in the country’s most populous Punjab province, seen as a litmus test for national elections. 
  

      The political polarization and economic crisis had placed Pakistan at “a critical juncture,” and the situation had the “potential to become a permanent crisis,” Sajjad said.
  

      Pakistan’s future trajectory “will largely depend on how its leaders navigate the ongoing crises and whether they can find a way to address the people’s grievances and restore stability,” he added.

5,Wildfires in Alberta off to an exponentially fast start compared to recent years,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/americas/canada-alberta-wildfires/index.html,"      With more than 410,000 hectares (about 1 million acres) charred so far in 2023, the extent of the burned area is larger than the country of Luxembourg and is roughly equivalent to the size of 1.5 Rhode Islands.
  

      The 273 wildfires in Alberta so far in 2023 have far exceeded each of the last five years to date as well. With temperatures expected to rise significantly by this weekend and into next week, a provincial state of emergency has been declared as weather conditions threaten to aid in fire growth and worsen the situation.
  

      “We are expecting record breaking temperatures across British Columbia and northern Alberta through early next week,” meteorologist Terri Lang from Environment Canada tells CNN. Last week’s abnormally warm and dry conditions have set the stage for more fires this weekend. “This is when we get very aggressive fire behavior,” explained Lang. “Throw in some wind and we are off to the races with regards to the wildfire season.”
  

      Temperatures will range between 10 and 15 degrees Celsius above average (18 to 27 degrees Fahrenheit) leading into the weekend, with the peak of the heat expected early next week. Edmonton’s average high temperature is 17°C (62°F) for the month of May, but has already experienced two 30°C (86 °F) days so far this month. The forecast calls for temperatures to exceed 30°C by early next week. “This is very hot for us,” said Lang.
  

      Billowing smoke from the over 80 active wildfires across the Alberta province has drifted across Canada and has reached the eastern seaboard of the United States, creating smoky skies across New England. The smoke is so thick that it is visible on satellite imagery, stretching from western Canada to the US East Coast.
  

      Forecasts indicate that smoke will continue to drift across Canada throughout the weekend, impacting the quality of air, while a notable shift in winds to the north and west will disperse the smoke toward British Columbia and the Northwest Territories through Saturday.
  

      Even though lightning was a factor in the recent uptick of wildfires across Alberta, “many of the wildfires so far this season have been human caused. That could be from anything ranging from sparks created by trains to people being careless where they throw their cigarettes butts,” explained Lang.

6,Evacuations ordered as rock teeters over Swiss village,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/europe/switzerland-brienz-alpine-rockslide-intl/index.html,"      Leaders in Brienz held a town hall event on Tuesday evening and told residents they would have to leave by 6 pm local time on Friday. 
  

      The head of the early warning service, Stefan Schneider, said that measurements indicated a “strong acceleration over a large area” in recent days, and “up to 2 million cubic meters of rock material will collapse or slide in the coming seven to 24 days.”  
  

      Experts warn such events may be a result of climate change. 
  

      The World Meteorological Organization’s annual State of the Climate Report, found that The European Alps saw a record year for glacier melt, with Switzerland particularly badly affected, losing 6% of its glacier volume between 2021 and 2022.
  

      Rebecca Dell, a researcher at the University of Cambridge warns that climate change is driving glacier melt in the Alps. 
  

      “This melt may destabilize the mountain slopes above towns and villages. If a slope becomes too unstable, events such as rockslides may occur,” she told CNN. 
  

      The village, which houses under 100 residents, according to Swiss public broadcaster SRF, is located in Switzerland’s eastern canton of Graubünden. 
  

      SRF reported that geological surveys suggested that the situation has become more precarious.  
  

      According to a statement by the Albula/Alvra municipality, over the last century, the village itself has moved a few centimeters each year, however the movement has accelerated over the last 20 years, and the landslide has now been moving about one meter per year.

7,At least 15 dead after boat capsizes in Nigeria,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/africa/nigeria-capsizing-sokoto-state-intl/index.html,"      A police spokesman, Sanusi Abubakar, told CNN on Wednesday that 21 out of 36 people on board were rescued after the boat overturned in the Dandeji River in Sokoto’s Shagari district.
  

      “There were 36 people on board. Twenty-one were rescued alive and 15 were drowned,” Abubakar said.
  

More than 50 dead and dozens still missing after boat sinks in northwest Nigeria 


      “Among the 15 who drowned were 13 females and two males,” he added.
  

      District chairman, Aliyu Dantani, told state-run media the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), that the boat was carrying mainly children who were in search of firewood, when it capsized. Locals rely on firewood for fuel.
  

      The bodies of the deceased were recovered by local divers and buried Tuesday according to Muslim tradition, Dantani said.
  

      The area has seen previous tragic boat accidents. 
  

      In April last year, around 29 people, mostly teenagers, died when a boat that ferried them across the Shagari river in search of firewood sank, local media reported at the time.
  

      A year earlier, 13 people, including children lost their lives in another boat accident in the area.

9,Authorities search for the names of 22 women murdered in Europe,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/europe/women-missing-murder-interpol-appeal-intl/index.html,"      Most of the murders are considered cold cases involving women who died 10, 20, 30 or even 40 years ago, according to Interpol, which launched a public campaign on Wednesday to name the women.
  

      “Despite extensive police investigations, these women were never identified, and evidence suggests they could have come from other countries. Who they are, where they are from and why they were in these countries is unknown,” Interpol said.
  

      “Someone, somewhere, knows something which can help identify these women. Just one piece of information could be the missing link,” Interpol Secretary General Jürgen Stock said on his official Twitter account as the campaign launched.
  

      For the first time, as part of the campaign called “Operation Identify Me,” Interpol has published so-called Black Notices about each victim, which include facial reconstruction images, information about personal items, clothes, jewelry, tattoos and pictures of the areas where the bodies were found.
  

      “If you remember a friend, family member or colleague who suddenly disappeared, please take a look and contact the relevant national police team via the form on each page if you have any information about any of them,” Interpol said.
  

      As the name of each woman is unknown, the cases are described by other characteristics and numbered. “The woman in the well” is the first unsolved murder.
  

      In 1991, the body of a woman was found in a rainwater well on the grounds of a cottage near Leuvensebaan in Belgium, about 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) northeast from Brussels. Her body may have been in the well for up to two years, according to Interpol.
  

      The woman is believed to have been between 30 and 55 years old when she was found, and 1.54 meters toll. She wore a distinctive t-shirt with black vertical stripes and a summer print. “The woman also wore dark plaid shorts, beige/brown knitted cardigan and a plastic or horn ring,” Interpol said.
  

      Interpol has also published images of the cottage and newspaper articles and asks the pubic to contact Belgium national police with any information about the case.
  

      Another case involves the murder of a woman who had a flower tattoo on her left forearm. Under the black flower with green leaves is written “R’NICK.”
  

      In 1992, the body of the woman was found against a grate in the water of the Groot Schijn river near Ten Eekhovelei in Antwerp, Belgium, Interpol said.
  

      “The woman had been killed by violence. To date, her identity is unknown,” Interpol said.
  

      She is believed to have been between 20 and 50 years old, about 1.70 meters tall. “She was light-skinned and had mid-length dark hair,” Interpol said. She wore a t-shirt with the inscription ‘SPLINTER’ and “1990,” dark blue Adidas training trousers with three green stripes and dark walking shoes.
  

      Authorities are urging anyone who may have information about the woman to contact Belgium national police.
  

      Belgium, German and Dutch police are working with Interpol on finding more information about the women. “The woman with the bracelet,” “the woman by the motorway,” “the woman on the boat,” “the woman with the flower skirt” and “the woman in men’s clothing” are how authorities are naming some of the other unidentified women.
  

      Details about each woman and “Operation Identify Me” have been published on the Interpol website. “They are someone’s friend, sister, cousin, daughter or mother. And they matter,” Interpol said.

10,"For Syrian refugees, Assad’s rehabilitation prompts fear of forced return",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/middleeast/syria-refugees-fear-assad-rehabilitation-mime-intl/index.html,"      For millions of Syrian refugees scattered around the world, the re-admission of the Syrian regime to the Arab family of nations on Sunday may have looked like victory for a dictator who was the very cause of their displacement and misery.  
  

      After an 11-year suspension, the Arab League welcomed Syria back into the bloc, giving President Bashar al-Assad a political lifeline despite strong objection from some of its key Western allies.  
  

      Advocates of Syria’s re-admission to the Arab League argued that it is part of an attempt to find an “Arab solution” to the Syrian crisis after all other efforts had apparently failed. A statement issued by the bloc on Sunday said the move “addresses the humanitarian, security and political crises in Syria, the crisis’ repercussions on neighboring countries, especially the burden of refugees, terrorism and drug smuggling.” 
  

      But some are skeptical of the bloc’s ability to find a humane and just solution to the refugee crisis, warning that a rapprochement with the Syrian regime could prompt hosting nations to force the return of Syrian refugees despite potential threats to their lives. 
  

Arab nations set to rehabilitate Syria's pariah president in defiance of US


      “The normalization of the Assad regime and welcoming him back into the Arab League is a step that can normalize the conversation about pushing refugees back to Syria, which is very risky,” said Omar Alshogre, a Sweden-based Syrian refugee and activist who says he was detained and tortured by Assad’s regime. 
  

      Alshogre, who was smuggled out of Syria in 2015, also expressed disappointment at “the silence of Arab populations,” which he says allows their Arab governments to act without accountability. 
  

      More than 14 million Syrians fled their homes looking for safety following the civil war between Assad and opposition forces who sought to unseat him. More than 300,000 civilians are estimated to have been killed. Over 6.8 million are internally displaced in Syria, two thirds of whom are women and children, according to the UN refugee agency. 
  

      Syrians fled to more than 130 countries, the UN says, predominantly neighboring Turkey, which shelters more than 3.6 million. Others traveled to Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, Egypt. Many fled to European countries, including Germany and Denmark. 
  

      According to a 2022 UNHCR poll of Syrian refugees living in Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq, only 1.7% said they would return to Syria in the next 12 months. Around 93% said they would not return, and 5.6% said they did not know.  
  

      Charles Lister, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington DC, told CNN that the polling data “simply cements the core reasoning for why the refugee crisis remains intractable.” 
  

      “Regional states can pressure Assad to accept returns all they want, but it’s not going to change the palpable terror felt by refugees who simply won’t choose to return,” he said. 
  

      Even before Arab normalization with the Assad regime began, human rights organizations had repeatedly warned that Syrian refugees risked facing forced returns home amid concerns for their safety.  
  

      Earlier this year, Denmark – which hosts more than 35,000 Syrian refugees – deemed more areas controlled by the Assad regime to be safe for return. 
  

      The announcement was met by condemnation from international human rights organizations, including Human Rights Watch, which said that “Denmark should refrain from playing into the regime’s hand.” 
  

      “While active hostilities may have decreased in recent years, the Syrian government continues to subject citizens to the same abuses that led them to flee in the first place, including arbitrary detention, mistreatment, and torture,” Human Rights Watch said just two months ago.  
  

      Lister said there is a real danger that “smaller numbers of deeply vulnerable refugees could be targeted for coerced returns.”

      “We’ve already seen this in Lebanon and Turkey, and to a limited extent in Jordan too – and that’s likely just the start,” Lister said, adding that forced refugee returns place victims at “extremely high risk of persecution by the regime, or regime-linked actors.” 
  

In neighboring Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has tried to put an end to the country’s refugee issue, a move that analysts have said was intended to boost his popularity ahead of this week’s election.  
  

      Earlier this year, Erdogan said that more Syrians will be returning home “as the security environment in northern Syria improves,” reported Turkish media, citing Erdogan as saying that some 550,000 refugees have so far returned to Syrian zones “cleared of terrorism and made safe.” 
  

Rights watchdogs have condemned Turkey’s push to return Syrians home, saying conditions in Syria are not safe. 
  

      The Syrian government said in a joint statement with Saudi Arabia last month, that it is working with its partners to “create the necessary conditions for the return of Syrian refugees and displaced persons.” It also stressed that it is working towards “ending their suffering, enabling them to return safely to their homeland.” 
  

      Some Syrians may not, however, have a choice, and pressure for their return is already mounting, especially after Sunday’s Arab League decision. “Syrian refugees are already facing pressures to return to Syria, despite it being clearly unsafe for them to do so, by third countries that would prefer they not remain,” HA Hellyer, Middle East scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told CNN.  
  

      “The further normalization goes, the deeper the pressure will be.” 
  

      Alshogre worries for himself as well as other Syrian refugees. Some governments, especially those with right-wing leaders, won’t hesitate to send Syrians back if they see an opportunity, he said, adding that he and others will refuse to go back.  
  

      “We will hide in the woods, we will hide under the ground, wherever,” he said. “If I am sent back to Syria, I will be cut into small pieces by the Syrian regime; I won’t make it out of the airport in Damascus.”

      Two visitors, a 30-year-old Tunisian and a 42-year-old French national, were also among the victims of the shooting, the Tunisian foreign ministry said in a statement Wednesday.
  

      The Israeli foreign ministry said the Tunisian citizen who was killed in the attack was a dual Israeli national. The ministry said it is “in contact with the family members of the deceased and is prepared to assist.”
  

      France’s foreign ministry condemned the “heinous attack,” expressing its “concern and deep sadness”.
  

      The identity of the shooter – who was killed by security forces – has not been made known so far.
  

      The attack came amid an annual pilgrimage to the island of Djerba that draws hundreds of Jews from Europe and Israel, Reuters reported.
  

      La Ghriba is Africa’s oldest synagogue, a revered and iconic location at the heart of the island, according to Reuters. It was built on the site of a Jewish temple that is believed to date back almost 1,900 years.
  

      Authorities did not identify a motive for the attack but Islamist militants have previously targeted the pilgrimage in Djerba and have staged other attacks in the country, according to Reuters.
  

      One of the most well-known attacks is the 2002 truck bombing by al Qaeda militants, which killed 21 Western tourists – prompting high security at the synagogue in the following years.

12,"Exclusive: Japan is in talks to open a NATO office as Ukraine war makes world less stable, foreign minister says",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/asia/japan-foreign-minister-hayashi-nato-intl-hnk/index.html,"      “We are already in discussions, but no details (have been) finalized yet,” Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi said on Wednesday, speaking a week ahead of the Group of Seven summit, hosted this year by Japan in Hiroshima.
  

      Hayashi specifically cited Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year as an event with repercussions far beyond Europe’s borders that forced Japan to rethink regional security.
  

      “The reason why we are discussing about this is that since the aggression by Russia to Ukraine, the world (has) become more unstable,” he said. 
  

      “Something happening in East Europe is not only confined to the issue in East Europe, and that affects directly the situation here in the Pacific. That’s why a cooperation between us in East Asia and NATO (is) becoming … increasingly important.”
  

      He added that Japan is not a treaty member of NATO, which stands for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization – but that the move sends a message the bloc’s Asia Pacific partners are “engaging in a very steady manner” with NATO.
  

      The opening of a NATO liaison office in Japan would mark a significant development for the Western alliance amid deepening geopolitical fault lines, and is likely to attract criticism from the Chinese government, which has previously warned against such a move. 
  

      The Nikkei Asia first reported plans to open the office in Japan last Wednesday, citing unnamed Japanese and NATO officials.
  

      NATO has similar liaison offices in other places including Ukraine and Vienna. The liaison office in Japan will enable discussions with NATO’s security partners, such as South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, on geopolitical challenges, emerging and disruptive technologies, and cyber threats, Nikkei reported last week. 
  

      In a statement to CNN last week, a NATO spokesperson said: “As to plans to open a liaison office in Japan, we won’t go into the details of ongoing deliberations among NATO allies.” She added that NATO and Japan “have a long-standing cooperation.”
  

      CNN reached out to NATO for comment on Wednesday after Hayashi’s remarks.
  

      Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent shockwaves through Europe and drove non-aligned Finland and Sweden to abandon their neutrality and seek protection within NATO, with Finland formally joining the bloc last month.
  

      Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been invited to participate in the G7 summit next week, said Hayashi, alongside the leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union. Zelensky is expected to dial in remotely.
  

      “Since we are hosting it here in Japan, so we have to talk about Asia Pacific, Indo-Pacific issues too,” he said, adding that the summit location in Hiroshima — where atomic bombs were dropped in 1945 — was partly chosen because “we would like to talk about nonproliferation and also disarmament,” topics that have come to the fore during the war in Ukraine.
  

      The war has also seen countries like Japan and South Korea draw closer to their Western partners, while presenting a united front against perceived threats closer to home.
  

What China really means when it talks about NATO's eastward expansion


      Hayashi highlighted what he described as Japan’s “severe and complex” regional security environment, noting that in addition to increased Russian aggression, Tokyo is also contending with a nuclear-armed North Korea and a rising China.
  

      China has been growing its naval and air forces in areas near Japan while claiming the Senkaku Islands, an uninhabited Japanese-controlled chain in the East China Sea, as its sovereign territory. In the face of growing friction, Japan recently announced plans for its biggest military buildup since World War II.
  

      Tensions between Japan and Russia have also been increasing in recent months, fueled in part by Russian military drills in the waters between the two nations, and joint Chinese-Russian naval patrols in the western Pacific close to Japan. 
  

      In April, Russian warships conducted anti-submarine exercises in the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea – and in March, Russian missile boats fired cruise missiles at a mock target in the same waters. And after Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida made a surprise visit to Ukraine in March, two Russian strategic bombers, capable of carrying nuclear weapons, flew over waters off the Japanese coast for more than seven hours, Reuters reported.
  

      Despite the growing regional tensions, Hayashi said the potential opening of the office was not aimed at specific countries. “This is not intended…to be sending a message,” said Hayashi. 
  

      He added that Japan and other countries still need to cooperate with China on larger issues such as climate change and the Covid-19 pandemic, and that Tokyo wanted a “constructive and stable relationship” with Beijing.
  

      China has previously warned against NATO expanding its reach into Asia and responded angrily to previous reports on the possible Japan office.
  

      “Asia is a promising land for cooperation and a hotbed for peaceful development. It should not be a platform for those who seek geopolitical fights,” said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning in a briefing last week. “NATO’s eastward push and interference in Asia Pacific matters will definitely undermine regional peace and stability.”
  

      Though Beijing has claimed impartiality in the Ukraine war and no advance knowledge of Russia’s intent, it has refused to condemn Moscow’s actions. Instead, it has parroted Kremlin lines blaming NATO for provoking the conflict – further fracturing relationships with both Europe and the US.
  

      And in March, senior Chinese Foreign Ministry officials and influential Communist Party publications accused the United States of seeking to build a NATO-like bloc in the Indo-Pacific, with one official warning of “unimaginable” consequences.
  

      On Wednesday, Hayashi played down concerns that opening a Tokyo NATO office could further inflame tensions, saying: “I don’t feel that’s the case.”
  

      The country has had a pacifist constitution since World War II – which he argued is reflected in this move.
  

      “We are not offending anyone, we’re defending ourselves from any kind of interference and concerns, and in some cases threats,” he said.

13,"Russia is sending museum pieces into war, but experts say they may still be effective",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/08/europe/russia-t-55-tanks-ukraine-intl-cmd/index.html,"      The video, seemingly filmed in late March, shows old Soviet tanks being transported, somewhere in Russia. Moscow has been known to bring out older military equipment from storage to help it prosecute the war in Ukraine, but these are different.
  

      The tanks are T-55s, a model first commissioned by the Soviet Union’s Red Army in 1948, shortly after the end of World War II.  
  

      They’re so old, you can find them in museums.  
  

      “This was the first main battle tank used by the Soviet Union in the Cold War era,” said historian John Delaney, a senior curator at the Imperial War Museum (IWM) in Duxford, Cambridge, as he shows one to CNN.  
  

      “Up until that point, you’d had three very distinctive types of tanks, light, medium and heavy, which had different roles on the battlefield,” Delaney said. “From the mid-50s onwards, there was this concept that tried to come up with a tank that could do a bit of everything and that became known as the main battle tank.”
  

      For the Red Army, that was the T-55 and its many variants, which later became the most widely produced tank in the world, with more than 100,000 units built. Cheap, reliable, easy to use and easy to maintain, it was a military mainstay from Egypt to China to Sudan, where they are still in use. 
  

      In Eastern Europe, they were used to quash uprisings in the former Warsaw Pact countries, rolling through the streets of Hungary in 1956, and then Prague, capital of what was then Czechoslovakia, in 1968.
  

      But in following decades, when deployed against Western-built tanks – in some Arab-Israeli conflicts, and then in the Gulf War – they were no match.
  

      “In the first Gulf War, in 1991 for example, the American and British tanks were knocking out Iraqi T-55s from 23 kilometers,” Delaney said.
  

      The version inside the IWM’s Land Warfare hall was built in the 1960s and belonged to the East German army. It was snapped up by the museum after German reunification, with Berlin favoring NATO-standard versions, such as the Leopard 1 and then Leopard 2 — which it has recently sent to Ukraine — and side-lining outdated Soviet equipment.
  

      By the time Russia began decommissioning its own T-55s in the 1980s, there were still upwards of 28,000 of them, Delaney said, adding that they were mothballed rather than scrapped.
  

      “The Soviets never threw anything away,” he explained. “There’s probably a significant number of them sitting in sheds waiting to be reconfigured.”
  

      Russia seems willing to do exactly that.
  

      Satellite imagery indicates Russia has been taking dozens of tanks out of storage at a base in Arsenyev, in Russia’s far East. Publicly available photos show one of the tanks being stored at the base is the T-55.  
  

      “They’ll have been sitting there for a decade or more,” Delaney says. “They’ll need a considerable amount of work to get them back into good running order.”
  

      After the footage of a trainload of tanks surfaced on social media in late March, the Conflict Intelligence Team (CIT), a team group of volunteers using open source intelligence to investigate conflicts in Ukraine and Syria, was the first to report these that T-54/55s were being brought out of storage at Arsenyev.
  

      Western officials then told CNN in April they had seen the elderly tank pop up close to the frontline. 
  

US to begin training Ukrainian forces on Abrams tanks next month


      Russia hasn’t confirmed it is deploying the T-55 to the front line and the Ministry of Defense in Moscow did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. But, in recent weeks, well-connected pro-Kremlin bloggers have shared photographs showing these tanks, reportedly in Russian-occupied territories in Ukraine. 
  

      The Netherlands-based open-source intelligence website Oryx says it has visual evidence Russia has lost more than 1,900 tanks since the beginning of the invasion, nearly two-thirds of an initial fleet of around 3,000. Beyond quantity, a big issue is the speed at which Russian armor is being taken down.
  

      “Overall Russia has lost a lot of equipment, it’s hard to build new equipment,” said Robert Lee, a former US Marine and senior fellow at the US-based Foreign Policy Research Institute. 
  

      “They are producing some new tanks — they are still producing T-90s — but, at the scale (required), they need more equipment than they can produce so they’re relying on older and older tanks to compensate,” Lee added.
  

      Trevor Taylor, director of the Defence, Industries and Society Programme at the Royal United Services Institute, says Western sanctions are also slowing down Russia’s weapons production. 
  

      “We’ve got multiple pieces of evidence that Russian industry, which had been given access to Western technology in the 90s, is really suffering from the restrictions,” Taylor said. “We’re hearing about them taking chips out of washing machines. And when you’re doing that, then you’re really obviously in quite a bit of difficulty.”
  

      Lee has been following the Russian invasion of Ukraine from the start, using open-source technology to gather information on the fighting in Ukraine. He has since visited the frontlines in Eastern Ukraine and, as Russia goes on the defensive, tank-on-tank battles have so far been rare and he believes the T-55s’ usage will be limited in scope. 
  

      “Some of those systems are probably going to be used in a rear area initially,” he said. “So, not necessarily tanks going forward, but more kind of firing into a long distance.” 
  

      If that is to be their purpose, Delaney believes the T-55 may still prove useful.
  

      “One of the things you can obviously use this [tank] for if you’re trying to avoid a tank versus tank engagement is to dig them in, in defensive positions, sit the tank in the pit so you can only see the turret and then that can be used to defend a front line against the counterattack,” he said. “If you’ve been the aggressor in a war and you’re suddenly about to be on the defensive, this would be effective for static defensive positions.”
  

      As Russian forces prepare to take the brunt of a widely anticipated, NATO-equipped Ukrainian offensive, they’re having to rely on a conscript army, less prepared than that of their opponent.
  

      And for under-trained soldiers, the T-55 provides something modern tanks don’t: ease of use.  
  

      “If you’ve got a lot of conscripts coming into your army, which you have at the moment with the Russian forces, it’s going to be easier, quicker to train people to use these than it is to use a more modern model of battle tank,” Delaney said.
  

      “It’s really easy to maintain and with a conscript army, that’s what you’re looking for, you’re looking for the ability to keep these things operational.” 
  

      Ukraine, in fact, also has a version of the T-55 in its arsenal – 28 highly-modernized M-55s supplied by Slovenia.
  

      As Ukraine gears up for its expected spring counteroffensive, Russia has dug in. Satellite imagery has revealed the extensive defensive lines built by Moscow’s forces across the regions they continue to occupy.
  

Ukraine says it used US-made Patriot system to intercept Russian hypersonic missile


      Lee believes a successful counteroffensive will come down to Ukrainian intelligence finding the perfect location to push through. 
  

      “It’s not impossible but a lot of it comes down to Ukraine finding weak points in a line and trying to narrowly penetrate,” he said.
  

      And that’s where modern, more advanced NATO equipment, with better armor, longer ranges and more maneuverability, could come into its own, especially when facing much older Soviet hardware.
  

      “I think faced with Western weapons, the Russians must expect very heavy casualties if they expect to move forward using the T-55 system,” Taylor said. “It’s a move of desperation to be using weapons of that vintage.” 
  

      And though tank battles have been rare, Ukraine has an advantage if they do occur.  
  

      “If you’ve got a big open country and you’re fighting a big, armored tank engagement over vast expanses of land, then this is at a very distinct disadvantage,” Delaney said of the Russians’ T-55s.
  

      “(Against a Leopard or a Challenger), if it’s a one-on-one tank engagement, this will lose every time.”

14,"‘A Trump tribute act’: Meet Suella Braverman, the commander-in-chief of Britain’s culture wars",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/07/uk/suella-braverman-profile-migration-gbr-intl/index.html,"      “I would love to (see) a front page of The Telegraph with a plane taking off to Rwanda,” the home secretary (interior minister) told that newspaper, referring to her controversial efforts to deport asylum-seekers to the central African nation. “That’s my dream. That’s my obsession.”
  

      Braverman is no stranger to the front pages. Her self-proclaimed “obsession” with curbing migration – and the loaded and occasionally inflammatory language she uses to address it – has attracted forceful criticism from international agencies, lawyers, rights groups and many of her own colleagues, making her arguably Britain’s most divisive politician. 
  

      But among Conservative Party members and the chief architects of Brexit, she is a star; someone who is prepared to say and do controversial things in pursuit of a singular goal. 
  

      “She’s the cutting edge of the populist, radical right-wing strain in the Conservative Party,” Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University in London, and the author of books on the party, told CNN.
  

      “In a way, that allows her to say what some Conservative MPs would think of as the unsayable.”
  

      Braverman has railed against what she calls an “invasion” of migrants, holding “values which are at odds with our country” – and suggested she would break international law to deport them from Britain.
  

      And she is an equally furious culture warrior, borrowing rhetoric from the American right when lambasting “woke” culture, transgender rights and climate protesters.
  

      “She’s recognized that in the current political climate, her way of creating an impact… (is) positioning herself as a Trump tribute act,” migration policy expert and campaigner Zoe Gardner told CNN.  
  

      But Braverman has speedily made herself a central figure in British politics; the assassin of Liz Truss’s premiership and the kingmaker of Rishi Sunak’s, she has made evident her desire to ultimately enter Downing Street as prime minister herself – a prospect that sits uneasily with much of the country’s political establishment.
  

      Braverman, who evangelizes on the benefits of Brexit and has made migration curbs her political mission, has a backstory that seems to teem with contradictions.
  

      She is the daughter of migrants, who wants to cut net migration to Britain to the “tens of thousands.” Her parents, both of Indian origin, arrived in the country from Kenya and Mauritius “with very little” in the 1960s.
  

      She was a practicing lawyer before entering politics, but has displayed an unabashed indifference about whether her flagship migration bill complies with international law.


      And she is an avid Francophile, sometimes speaking in French when meeting her counterpart in Paris, who championed the project to leave the European Union. Braverman says she fell in love with France while studying at the renowned Sorbonne university in Paris, taking advantage of the EU’s Erasmus program that encourages students to spend time in other parts of the continent. Brexit shut the program off to British students. 
  

      Now, she has staked her political reputation on her ability to “Stop the Boats” – an oft-repeated government pledge, borrowed from Australia’s hardline rhetoric towards asylum-seekers, to reduce the growing number of migrants crossing the English Channel on small vessels.
  

      It is a stance that has drawn sharp criticism – including from within the traditional wing of Braverman’s Conservative Party.
  

      “Braverman has placed far too much emphasis on curbing migration,” said Ben Ramanauskas, an economist and adviser to Truss when the previous prime minister was secretary of state for international trade. “Her priority seems to be attempting to be as cruel as possible.”
  

      The government’s flagship bill, which was approved by MPs last week but faces scrutiny in the House of Lords, essentially hands the government the right to deport anyone arriving illegally in the United Kingdom. “It’s incredibly dangerous, hostile, cruel, and fundamentally unworkable,” Gardner  said. 
  

      And experts say it deliberately misses the point. “Deterrents don’t work… There is absolutely no correlation whatsoever between how brutally we respond to migration, and the numbers of people forced to move,” Gardner said. “We need a functioning asylum system where we process people’s claims, (and) we need to give people safe routes in order to travel.”
  

UK plan to house migrants in barracks and barges is condemned as 'cruel' and unworkable


      Braverman, however, is steadfast in the face of criticism. The Home Office told CNN in a statement that her bill “will break the business model of the people smuggling gangs and restore fairness to our asylum system. It will ensure anyone arriving via small boat or other dangerous and illegal means will be in scope for detention and swiftly removed.” 
  

      Braverman’s plans have won praise from Europe’s leading populist figures, including Italy’s hardline deputy leader Matteo Salvini and French far-right presidential candidate Eric Zemmour.
  

      But that is company many in the Conservatives feel uncomfortable keeping. 
  

      “The UK’s ability to play a role internationally is based on our reputation – not because we’re British, but because of what we stand for and what we do,” ex-Prime Minister Theresa May said in a stinging intervention in the House of Commons last month. May added last week that the bill’s removal of modern slavery protections “will consign victims to remaining in slavery.”
  

      And Sayeeda Warsi, the first Asian chair of the Tory party, has attacked what she described as Braverman’s “racist rhetoric,” after Braverman prompted controversy by singling out British Pakistani men when attacking grooming gangs in the country. 
  

      “Braverman’s own ethnic origin has shielded her from criticism for too long,” Warsi wrote in The Guardian. “Black and brown people can be racist too.” The Home Office told CNN that Braverman “has been clear that all despicable child abusers must be brought to justice. And she will not shy away from telling hard truths, particularly when it comes to the grooming of young women and girls in Britain’s towns who have been failed by authorities over decades.”
  

      Braverman fronts a newer, more populist streak in the UK’s ruling party – a move that has troubled some of its grandees but has found an audience among voters.
  

      “The voters that she’s appealing to is the majority of the British public,” said James Johnson, who ran polling in May’s Downing Street operation and later founded the JL Partners pollster. “There is a very significant disconnect between what people on Twitter about immigration, and what people actually think about immigration.
  

      “Voters do not react to (Braverman’s) language with the same outrage that some people do,” he told CNN. “(They) want their politicians to at least be trying.”
  

      Polling shows that approval of Braverman’s tough stance on migration significantly outpaces support for the government in general – as well as approval of Braverman herself – with research often indicating that a slim majority of the public supports her plans.
  

      And those who support her – particularly those in Euroskeptic circles, where she is almost revered – say Braverman speaks to the concerns of modern Britain in a way that her more seasoned critics cannot. “When finally even I wobbled about backing Brexit in name only, Suella stood firm,” prominent Brexit backer Steve Baker said when he supported her leadership campaign last year, praising Braverman’s resolve to defeat May’s Brexit deal and push for a harder-line departure from the EU. “It wouldn’t have happened without her.”
  

      But research has also shown that the importance of immigration to British voters has receded since the bitter debates of the mid-2010s. 
  

      It appears inevitable that the Tories will seek to make migration a wedge issue at the next election, ensuring Braverman plenty of airtime as the government looks to draw a contrast between itself and the Labour party. But a series of brutal electoral results in local polls on Thursday will further fuel questions about whether that is a winning strategy.
  

      Braverman’s political coming-of-age took place just as the 2016 EU referendum shifted the tectonic plates underneath Westminster, giving younger, Euroskeptic voices like hers an inroad with the public.
  

      It was Braverman’s role fronting an anti-EU backbench committee that “propelled her to her (current) position, and she knows it,” former Conservative MP Antoinette Sandbach told CNN. 
  

      Today, she takes the populist mantle further than many of her peers on a range of matters far beyond Brexit. Braverman appears to relish “culture war” confrontations with her political enemies like few other frontline politicians; “you almost feel sometimes that she gets a kick out of ‘owning the libs,’” the politics professor Bale told CNN. 
  

      She has taken aim at the “Guardian-reading, tofu-eating wokerati” from the despatch box, and insisted she will “not be hectored by out-of-touch lefties.” In 2019, she said she considers herself engaged in a “battle against cultural Marxism.” 
  

      Braverman’s Home Office recently reportedly backed two pub landlords who refused to remove their minstrel-style children’s toys that are considered a racist relic of the 1970s. And she has criticized police officers for “virtue signaling,” saying in a speech last week that “they shouldn’t be taking the knee.”
  

      But those battles have left some traditional Tories cold. “The Conservative Party has moved right since I joined, and become much more like the MAGA Republicans” since the dividing line of 2016, said Sandbach, who was expelled from the party by Boris Johnson after trying to avert a no-deal Brexit. She subsequently joined the Liberal Democrats. 
  

      Those who worked alongside Braverman describe her as friendly and personable, and few doubt her ambition. 
  

      As 23-year-old Suella Fernandes, she nearly ran against her own mother to become the Tory candidate in a 2003 by-election, until the elder Fernandes – a Conservative councilor and NHS nurse – persuaded her to pull out. 
  

      Braverman succeeded in becoming an MP in 2015. In a series of tweets that bemoaned her “lamentable hopelessness,” one of her more critical backbenchers, William Wragg, claimed she asked in her first week in Parliament whether she could expense a fine for speeding. 
  

      But her determination to drive towards power has served her well. No politician emerged more triumphant from the psychodrama that has transfixed British politics than Braverman, who started 2022 as attorney general and ended it a household name – having served in three different Cabinets, twice as home secretary.
  

      An initial departure from frontline politics theoretically came amid scandal (Braverman resigned for breaching ministerial rules by using a private email address), but her scathing parting letter turned her misconduct into a maneuver, essentially pulling the plug on Truss’s shambolic tenure. 
  

The 'anti-woke' crusade has come to Europe. Its effects could be chilling


      “I have made a mistake; I accept responsibility: I resign,” Braverman wrote, in a thinly veiled attempt to contrast herself with Truss. Six days later she was back in the same post, having aligned herself with Sunak’s successful leadership bid.
  

      Few doubt Braverman’s long-term ambitions. “You have to interpret everything Suella Braverman does and says in the light of the leadership contest that many people assume will take place if… Sunak were to lose the next election,” Bale said.
  

      Crucial to that target is her reputation among party members and its more hardline MPs. It is those groups that pick a party leader, and she is met enthusiastically by grassroots Conservatives who tend to reflect the more right-wing, populist traits of the bloc.
  

      That prospect undoubtedly perturbs some. “There will be many Tory MPs who simply could not stomach her as leader,” Bale added. “I think the lack of support she received in her leadership bid (last year) reflects how she was seen by the party as a whole,” Sandbach said.
  

      Nevertheless, Braverman is storming up the approval rankings among ordinary Conservative members. In its latest monthly league table of Cabinet ministers, the ConservativeHome website – widely regarded as having its finger on the pulse of the grassroots party – puts Braverman fourth from the top with a net approval rating of 47.8. Only last November, she was sixth from bottom in the site’s regular survey of party members. “The panel seems to have decided that if the Government fails to stop the boats it won’t be for want of the Home Secretary trying,” wrote the website’s editors in April.
  

      Should Braverman succeed at her next bid for the party leadership, her critics fear another rightwards shift in British politics. 
  

      “Braverman has taken some cues from the US, and also from history,” Gardner said. 
  

      “She’s setting herself up to lead a more extreme, right-wing populist version of the Tory party.”

15,‘Nothing left to grind the meat with’: Wagner boss threatens to withdraw from Bakhmut amid ammo shortage,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/06/europe/wagner-bakhmut-withdraw-meat-grind-intl-hnk/index.html,"      On his official Telegram channel on Saturday, Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin blamed the lack of ammunition on Russia’s military command and said his forces would begin to withdraw from May 10.
  

      “We’ve taken 95% of Bakhmut. For this last 5%, the ‘Red Army’ [the Russian Armed Forces] are not playing any role,” Prigozhin said.
  

      “We don’t have the necessary ammunition, and no one has communicated with us about getting back to full capacity,” Prigozhin said. 
  

      “It is better to save our army than to win a battle.”
  

      The announcement by Prigozhin – sometimes dubbed “Putin’s chef” because his catering companies provided services for the Kremlin – follows the release last week of expletive-laden video footage in which he challenged Russia’s military leadership and blamed defense chiefs for “tens of thousands” of Wagner casualties.
  

      Prigozhin, whose Wagner mercenary group has taken on a growing role in the Ukraine conflict as Russian forces falter, has been highly visible on the front lines in recent months – where he has claimed credit for territorial gains, particularly in the battles raging around the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut.
  

      But as Prigozhin’s stature has increased, so too have his clashes with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and chief of the Russian armed forces Gen. Valery Gerasimov, prompting speculation about possible elite infighting in Moscow as Russia’s military campaign fails to advance.
  

      In February, Prigozhin accused the two men of “treason” for their alleged failures to support and supply the Wagner group in Ukraine.
  

      His most recent challenge to Russian defense officials comes as Bakhmut remains heavily contested.
  

Putin faces a deluge of bad news as Wagner says it will withdraw from frontline and Kremlin comes under attack


      In his Telegram message Saturday, Prigozhin said Wagner’s role in Bakhmut had been to grind down Ukrainian forces while allowing Russian forces to regroup.
  

      “On October 8, 2022, together with the Army General Sergei Surovikin, it was decided to launch the operation ‘Bakhmut meat grinder’ – an assault on the village of Bakhmut in order to provoke (Ukrainian President) Vladimir Zelensky to throw in as many forces as possible to hold Bakhmut. In Bakhmut, we grinded (the Ukrainian forces), hence the name – ‘Bakhmut meat grinder,’” Prigozhin said.
  

      “The purpose of the operation ‘Bakhmut meat grinder’ was to enable the units of the Russian army to take advantageous lines of defense, mobilize, re-equip, train personnel and increase their combat potential,” he added.
  

      “With regards to the Bakhmut meat grinder, there will be no more meat grinder because there’s nothing left to grind the meat with,” Prigozhin said. 
  

      Prigozhin’s message came as the notorious Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov called on Wagner fighters to join forces with his Akhmat battalion in Bakhmut. 
  

      “The Wagner (company) has very good, courageous, necessary, necessary people, necessary to us, because they know the area,” Kadyrov said in a video message on Saturday.
  

      “If you stay with us, I promise you that we will give you more, create better conditions, than you have today. We will try to make everything top notch for you,” said Kadyrov, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
  

      “You (Wagner fighters) know our commanders. You can contact them – any group, the number does not matter,” the Chechen leader noted.
  

      Kadyrov also posted an image of his letter to Putin “to issue combat orders on the removal of Akhmat units from other directions in order to hand Wagner positions in Bakhmut over to them.”

16,Wagner boss suggests his forces may stay in Bakhmut after threatening to withdraw,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/07/europe/prigozhin-wagner-bakhmut-russia-support-intl/index.html,"      In an explosive, expletive-laden rant this week, Prigozhin appeared in front of dozens of his dead soldiers and blamed Russia’s military leadership for “tens of thousands” of Wagner casualties. He declared that his men would leave Bakhmut by May 10 because of inadequate supplies, resulting in heavy losses.
  

      But a new audio message posted Sunday on Telegram suggests he has changed his mind after concessions from the Russian government.
  

      “The bottom line is the following: they promise to give us ammunition and weapons, as much as we need to continue further actions. They swear to us that everything that is necessary will be on the flank so the enemy сan’t cut us off. We are told that we can act in Bakhmut as we see fit,” Prigozhin said.
  

      The Russian Ministry of Defense did not immediately comment on Prigozhin’s latest claim.
  

      Bakhmut has been the site of a months-long assault by Russian forces that has driven thousands from their homes and left the area devastated. But, despite the vast amounts of manpower and resources Russia has poured into capturing Bakhmut, they have not been able to take total control of the city.
  

      “We’ve taken 95% of Bakhmut. For this last 5%, the ‘Red Army’ [the Russian Armed Forces] are not playing any role,” Prigozhin said in a message posted on his official Telegram channel Saturday.
  

      Prigozhin’s blunt and brutal tactics in Bakhmut have long been likened to a “meat grinder.” But, in his repeated threats to withdraw from Bakhmut, Prigozhin claimed this approach was no longer viable.
  

      “There will be no more meat grinder because there’s nothing left to grind the meat with,” Prigozhin said.
  

      The Wagner boss had said Wagner positions in and around Bakhmut would be transferred to Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov’s forces from May 10.
  

      But Prigozhin’s latest message posted Sunday revealed that Russia’s Ministry of Defense had pledged significant support to the Wagner group, including allowing general Sergey Surovikin, the former overall commander of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, to help organize Wagner’s operations.
  

      “They give us Surovikin as a person who will make all decisions in the framework of the military operations of PMC Wagner and interact with the Ministry of Defense,” Prigozhin said.
  

Opinion: How the battle for Bakhmut exposed Russia's 'meat-grinder'


      Prigozhin had also previously floated the possibility that Wagner might be disbanded without greater support from the Russian government, but appeared to also row back from these suggestions in the new audio message.
  

      “I specifically asked a question to all junior commanders, who immediately brought it to the attention of the fighters: if someone wants, they can go to other military formations. Everyone unequivocally answered ‘No.’”

17,"The lady in blue, vanishing princes and the crowning event: Key moments from the coronation",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/06/uk/coronation-king-charles-key-moments-ckc-gbr-intl-scli/index.html,"      CNN takes a look at some of the most memorable moments.
  

      Charles was hidden from view for the most dramatic part of the service at London’s Westminster Abbey on Saturday. 
  

      Behind a three-sided screen, the Dean of Westminster poured holy oil from the Ampulla, a gold eagle-shaped flask, on to the Coronation Spoon, and then the Archbishop of Canterbury anointed Charles on his head, breast and hands, according to the Church of England’s liturgy.
  

      The 12th-century, silver-gilt spoon is the oldest object used in coronations. In the background, the Choir of Westminster Abbey sang the anthemic “Zadok the Priest” by George Frideric Handel, which was composed for the coronation of King George II in 1727 and performed at every British coronation since.
  

      Once he re-emerged, the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby placed St. Edward’s Crown upon Charles III’s head. It was the only time Charles will ever wear St. Edward’s Crown, which is reserved for the coronation of a new monarch; the crown was made for the new King’s namesake, Charles II, in 1661.
  

      After crowning Charles, Welby shouted: “God Save the King.” Those in attendance repeated the words.
  

      Soon after, Camilla was also crowned. Like her husband, she was anointed with holy oil by the Archbishop of Canterbury – this time in full view of the audience – before having Queen Mary’s Crown placed on her head.
  

      Music underpinned the entire celebration, in keeping with history. Each stage was marked by either a grand choral work, an ethereal motet, an extravagant organ composition or an evocative melody, all performed by some of the most accomplished singers and musicians in the world.
  

      King Charles and Queen Camilla entered the abbey to the strains of “I was glad,” the stirring coronation anthem written by Hubert Parry for the coronation of King Edward VII in 1902 and sung at all coronations since then.
  

      But the old was blended with the new; Charles had asked Andrew Lloyd Webber – whose music is more familiar to audiences in the West End than congregations in Westminster Abbey – to write a Coronation Anthem, “Make a Joyful Noise,” which played after Camilla was enthroned.
  

      And this event featured the first ever appearance by a gospel choir at a coronation; dressed in resplendent white, the Ascension Choir performed ‘Alleluia’ just before the Archbishop’s sermon.
  

      Thousands of people had packed into Westminster Abbey.
  

      Decked in a teal cape and cap with gold detailing, a woman in blue commanded attention as she wielded an important object of the coronation regalia – the Sword of Offering or the Jewelled Sword, before and after the investiture, when it was used. But who is she? 
  

      Penny Mordaunt is a Conservative lawmaker in the United Kingdom, and has been since 2010. 
  

      She was involved in the ceremony because, as the current Leader of the House of Commons, she is also the Lord President of the Privy Council – a body formed of senior politicians who act as the monarch’s official advisers.
  

      The council’s president is involved in a variety of royal ceremonies, acting as a symbolic bridge between the King or Queen and the country’s elected officials. Mordaunt spoke at the Proclamation of King Charles, two days after the Queen’s death.


Queen Camilla was a regal sight in ivory, silver and gold. But who was she wearing? 
  

      Unsurprisingly, it was a British designer, Bruce Oldfield, who she has a longstanding relationship with. 
  

      Simple, tailored and cut from Peau de Soie, a silk fabric with a dull luster finish, her coronation dress was more akin to a coat dress with an embroidered underskirt as opposed to a traditional dress. 
  

      Arriving at Westminster Abbey before the service, her dress was protected by the crimson velvet and ermine Robe of State that was originally made for Queen Elizabeth’s coronation. 
  

      Peeping out beneath her dress were shoes in the same silk as her clothing, made by British designer Elliot Zed.
  

      Never one to disappoint at royal events, Prince Louis, the youngest child of the Prince and Princess of Wales, again stole the show during segments of the coronation ceremony.
  

      Keen-eyed viewers may have noticed the 5-year-old yawning, sitting between his mother, the Princess of Wales, and sister Princess Charlotte, but then pulling a disappearing act from the service. 
  

      It was thought the young royal might leave early, but luckily for fans, he returned before the end of the service. 
  

      For those who don’t remember, Louis gained global infamy during the late Queen’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations in June, where he was captured throwing a tantrum and covering his ears while screaming during the flypast.
  

      Meanwhile, there was widespread speculation before Saturday as to whether Prince Harry would be at his father’s coronation. 
  

      The Duke of Sussex attended the coronation ceremony at Westminster Abbey on Saturday, sitting in the third row.
  

      Wearing a morning suit with his military medals, Harry arrived alongside his uncles, Prince Edward and Prince Andrew, and two of his cousins, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie.
  

      Prince Harry attended without his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, who reportedly stayed back in the US with their children on the account of Archie’s fourth birthday. 
  

      The coronation marked the first time the prince publicly met members of his family since the release of his memoir, “Spare.” 


      After it ended, he was seen talking and smiling with his cousins amidst a downpour, before he took a car on his own. 
  

      He did not appear with members of the royal family to greet the public from the balcony of Buckingham Palace on Saturday afternoon – a flagship part of royal events.
  

      CNN understands that Prince Harry did not receive an invitation to join the family for this balcony moment, which featured a slimmed-down flypast by the Royal Air Force. Prince Andrew wasn’t present either.
  

      The weather did not favor King Charles – and while crowds seemed unperturbed by the rain, it did alter plans for the traditional Royal Air Force flypast.
  

      The display was formed only of helicopters and the colorful Red Arrows, and not the expected Typhoons, Spitfires, Hurricanes and Lancaster bombers.
  

      But crowds instead enjoyed not one but two appearances on the balcony by the new King and Queen, who provided an encore after seemingly waving goodbye to supporters.
  

      That wrapped up an eventful day, which had drawn thousands onto London’s streets.

18,Analysis: Ukraine says it stopped a missile Russia said was unstoppable,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/07/europe/russian-ballistic-missile-analysis-intl/index.html,"      Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military have touted the Kinzhal, or Kh-47, as an example of Russia’s modernized missile arsenal, claiming that its hypersonic speed makes it extremely difficult to intercept. 
  

      An air-launched ballistic missile, the Kh-47 has a range of some 2,000 kilometers (1,250 miles), so can be fired far from the battlefield. 
  

      It travels at about 10 times the speed of sound and is derived from the shorter-range Iskander ballistic missile, which is ground launched. It carries a warhead of nearly 500 kilograms.
  

      Ukrainian intelligence believes Russia has only a few dozen Kinzhal missiles in its arsenal – a claim which couldn’t be independently verified. 
  

      Several Kinzhal missiles were launched at Ukrainian targets in March, but it’s not clear what damage they did or whether they all reached their targets. In April, Ukraine’s Defense Ministry said Patriot systems had arrived from the US, Germany and the Netherlands.
  

      If one of those systems has now destroyed a Kh-47, as the Ukrainians say, it calls into question the capabilities of one of Russia’s new generation of weapons.
  

      After the Kinzhal was first tested, Putin told Russia’s Federal Council in 2018: “The unique flight characteristics of the high-speed carrier aircraft allow the missile to be delivered to the point of discharge within minutes.” 
  

      He also said that its hypersonic speed would allow it to “overcome all existing and, I think, prospective anti-aircraft and anti-missile defense systems, delivering nuclear and conventional warheads in a range of over 2,000 kilometers.”
  

      Russia has made ambitious claims for several of its newer military systems, but their prowess is unproven. 
  

      Though deployed in small numbers, the Russians’ newest main battle tank, the T-90M, has appeared vulnerable to unsophisticated munitions, and the flagship of Russia’s Black Sea fleet, the Moskva, was sunk early in the conflict.
  

Russia's war in Ukraine


      Analysts have questioned the Kinzhal’s capabilities during the final phase of its flight, suggesting it may not be as maneuverable or as fast as it approaches a target.
  

      The deployment of the Patriot represents a sea change in Ukraine’s air defense capabilities, which have been highly reliant on Soviet-era S-300 air defenses – for which munitions now appear in short supply. 
  

      The Patriots provide a modern dimension to Ukraine’s air defense layers, as does the German IRIS-T system. But it’s also much more complex, requiring about 100 personnel to operate.
  

      Ukrainian air force spokesman Yurii Inhat said Saturday that the Russians “were saying that the Patriot is an outdated American weapon, and Russian weapons are the best in the world.”
  

      “Well, there is confirmation that it effectively works against even a super hypersonic missile.” Ihnat said, adding that intercepting the Kinzhal is “a slap in the face for Russia.”

      The announcement came two days after Syria was readmitted into the Arab League – despite repeated objections from the United States to ending the isolation of a regime that it holds accountable for the deaths of more 300,000 civilians and displacement of millions in the country’s civil war.
  

      Damascus also announced the decision to resume work of its diplomatic mission in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, according to Syrian state media SANA, citing a statement from an official source at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

      “Based on the deep bonds and common affiliation of the peoples of the Syrian Arab Republic and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and in confirmation of both communities’ wills, and based on the Syrian Arab Republic believe in the importance of strengthening bilateral relations between Arab countries to serve joint Arab action, The Syrian Arab Republic decided to resume the work of its diplomatic mission in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,” the statement reads. 
  

      Officials and analysts have said that Syria’s re-admission into the Arab League, while symbolic, comes with the hope that it could pave the way for President Bashar Al Assad’s rehabilitation internationally, and potentially the removal of crippling sanctions against his regime.

20,Three Islamic Jihad commanders and family members among multiple dead in Israeli strikes on Gaza,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/08/middleeast/israel-islamic-jihad-idf-strike-gaza-intl-hnk/index.html,"      One of the three Islamic Jihad commanders killed overnight was working on capabilities to launch rockets from the West Bank toward Israel, IDF chief spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said Tuesday.
  

      Speaking to reporters during a briefing, Hagari said Tariq Muhammad Ezzedine was involved in Islamic Jihad operations in the West Bank, including bringing “improvised rockets that will be launched from the West Bank into Israel to harm civilians.”
  

      Rockets have never been fired from the West Bank into Israel.
  

      Islamic Jihad confirmed three of its commanders were killed in the overnight operation along with their wives and children.
  

      The commanders killed were Jihad Shaker Al-Ghannam, secretary of the Military Council in the al Quds Brigades; Khalil Salah al Bahtini, commander of the Northern Region in the al Quds Brigades; and Ezzedine, one of the leaders of the military wing of the al Quds Brigades in the West Bank, the group said. 
  

      The group vowed a “response” to Israeli airstrikes, calling the attacks an “aggressive, heinous massacre.”
  

      Hamas, the Palestinian militant movement that runs Gaza, issued a similar statement, promising a “firm response from the unified resistance forces, whose unity is manifested in its greatest form in the field.”
  

      Hagari said the operation had been planned since last Tuesday, when Islamic Jihad fired more than 100 rockets toward Israel following the death of its former spokesman while on hunger strike in an Israeli prison.
  

      But, the IDF did not have the “operational conditions” until overnight.
  

      “On the day on which the rockets were fired last week, I ordered – together with the Defense Minister – the preparation of an operation to target the arch-terrorists that would, in effect, hit the senior leadership of the organization in the Gaza Strip,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday at the start of a security cabinet meeting.
  

      “Our principle is clear: Whoever harms us – we will strike at them and with great force. Our long arm will reach every terrorist at a time and place of our choosing,” he added.
  

      The IDF launched a further stike on Tuesday, saying its air force targeted “a terrorist squad” belonging to Islamic Jihad in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip.
  

      “The squad was taking Anti-tank guided missiles by car to a launch pad in the city of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip. IDF soldiers monitored the activity of the squad and struck it while they were on their way to the launch pad,” IDF said.
  

      The Palestinian ministry of health in Gaza said two people were killed and two others injured in that attack east of Khan Younis, although they have yet to identify them, bringing the death toll in Gaza to 15.
  

      The Al Shifa hospital in Gaza said those killed in the overnight strikes were members of four families plus one other individual.
  

      The dead included five women and four children, a list of the dead released by the Al-Shifa Medical Complex showed.
  

      One of the Palestinian men killed in Israeli airstrikes was a prominent dentist, Jamal Khaswan, who died along with his wife and son, the Ministry of Health added. Khaswan was Chairman of the Board of Directors of Al-Wafa Hospital, the ministry said, praising him as a scientific and practical man of great determination.
  

      He held Russian citizenship, according to the Russian Representative Office in Ramallah. The Russian Mission said Khaswan and his wife left behind two orphaned children who are also Russian citizens.
  

      The Ministry of Health added that 20 people had been injured, including three children and seven women.
  

      When asked about civilians who were also killed in the attack, IDF spokesperson Hagari said they were not intentionally targeted.
  

      “In every operation we try to create that we will have the minimize the harm of civilians and minimize collateral damage,” Hagari said. “Unfortunately, we had women and children that were dead. We would rather have no uninvolved personnel dead in our operations but it’s hard we’re working against terrorist who are conducting their activity day and night amongst civilians. We are trying to create conditions for minimum harm of people in our operations.”
  

      Hagari said that while the IDF focused specifically on Islamic Jihad, the military is prepared for any expanded scenario.
  

      “We are ready all our capabilities especially in the defense the Iron Dome all around the country and also planes are ready,” he said.
  

      Islamic Jihad said Ghannam, 62, was also commander-in-chief of the al Quds Brigades and has been wanted for over 20 years, having survived five previous assassination attempts.
  

      He had worked in Yasser Arafat’s Fatah and the Popular Resistance Committees, secular Palestinian militant groups that predate the emergence of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the group said. 
  

Israel military and Palestinians trade fire following hunger striker's death


      The IDF accused Ghannam of coordinating weapons and money transfers between Islamic Jihad and Hamas, the militant group which runs Gaza. It called him one of the most senior members of Islamic Jihad.
  

      Calling the strikes “Operation Shield and Arrow,” the IDF said its fighter jets and helicopters hit 10 Islamic Jihad targets, including what it said were “rocket production workshops in Khan Yunis,” weapon manufacturing sites, military compounds, a concrete manufacturing site and a military post in southern Gaza. 
  

      Video from Gaza showed explosions lighting up the night sky and the rubble from buildings hit by the strikes. 
  

      The latest violence came almost a week after Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza exchanged fire following the death of a prominent Palestinian hunger striker in an Israeli prison.
  

      Israel conducted strikes on what it said were targets belonging to Hamas as dozens of rockets were fired from Gaza toward Israel on May 2. 
  

      It followed the death of Palestinian detainee Khader Adnan, an Islamic Jihad former spokesman who became a symbol of Palestinian resistance to Israeli detention policies, in Israeli custody after 87 days of hunger strike.
  

      Israel’s Foreign Minister Eli Cohen cut short a three-day official visit to India in the wake of the Israeli airstrikes on Gaza.
  

      He said he had received a security update immediately on landing in New Delhi on Tuesday, when he was due to travel to the city of Agra and then to the financial capital Mumbai on Wednesday, according to an itinerary published by India’s Ministry of External affairs.
  

      Gaza is one of the most densely packed places in the world, an isolated coastal enclave of almost two million people crammed into 140 square miles. 
  

      Governed by the Palestinian militant group Hamas, the territory is largely cut off from the rest of the world by an Israeli blockade of Gaza’s land, air and sea dating back to 2007. Egypt controls Gaza’s southern border crossing, Rafah.
  

      Israel has placed heavy restrictions on the freedom of civilian movement and controls the importation of basic goods into the narrow coastal strip.
  

      IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Richard Hecht said he did not know if there would be more follow up strikes.
  

      “We don’t know yet where we go. It’s still early,” he said. “We’re ready for as long as it takes. The big question is Hamas. What will they decide to do?”

21,"Israeli military took no accountability for journalists it killed over past 20 years, press freedom group says",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/09/middleeast/israel-military-journalists-killed-intl/index.html,"      The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) published the report on Tuesday, just two days before the one-year-anniversary of the death of Al Jazeera Arabic correspondent Shireen Abu Akleh, a 51-year-old Palestinian-American who was killed by a bullet to the head on May 11, 2022 while covering an Israeli military operation in Jenin.   
  

      The report says it found “a pattern of the killings of journalists by Israel Defense Forces (IDF), after which no accountability is taken,” according to a CPJ press release.    
  

      The press advocacy group said it had documented at least 20 journalists killed by Israeli military fire since 2001, adding 18 of those killed were Palestinian. “No one has ever been charged or held accountable for these deaths,” it said in the press release.    
  

      The CPJ said its report – titled ‘Deadly Pattern’ – found a “routine sequence” that takes place when a journalist is killed at the hands of the IDF.    
  

      “Israeli officials discount evidence and witness claims, often appearing to clear soldiers for the killings while inquiries are still in progress,” the CPJ said, describing the IDF’s procedure for examining military killings of civilians such as journalists as a “black box,” with the results of any such probe kept confidential.   
  

      “When probes do take place, the Israeli military often takes months or years to investigate killings and families of the mostly Palestinian journalists have little recourse inside Israel to pursue justice,” the CPJ said.    
  

      A CNN investigation in May last year unearthed evidence – including two videos of the scene of the shooting – that there was no active combat, nor any Palestinian militants, near Abu Akleh in the moments leading up to her death. 
  

      Footage obtained by CNN, corroborated by testimony from eight eyewitnesses, an audio forensic analyst and an explosive weapons expert, suggested that Israeli forces took aim at the journalist.    
  

      While the IDF admitted for the first time in September that there was a “high possibility” Abu Akleh was “accidentally” shot and killed by Israeli fire, its Military Advocate General’s Office said in a statement that it did not intend to pursue criminal charges or prosecutions of any of the soldiers involved.   
  

      Abu Akleh was wearing a helmet and a blue protective vest marked “Press” when she was fatally shot. The CPJ report found at least 13 of the 20 journalists killed “were clearly identified as members of the media or were inside vehicles with press insignia at the time of their deaths.”    
  

      The report finds that Israeli forces “repeatedly fail to respect press insignia, sending a chilling message to journalists and media workers throughout the West Bank and Gaza,” where all 20 of the journalists mentioned in the report were killed.   
  

      The CPJ said it sent “multiple requests” to the IDF’s press office to interview military prosecutors and officials, and that the military “refused to meet with CPJ for an on-the-record interview.”   
  

      Responding to the CPJ report, the IDF said it “regrets any harm to civilians during operational activity and considers the protection of the freedom of the press and the professional work of journalists to be of great importance.”  
  

      “The IDF does not intentionally target noncombatants, and live fire in combat is used only after all other options have been exhausted,” it stressed in a statement.
  

Al Jazeera submits Shireen Abu Akleh case to ICC


      The IDF “regularly examines and investigates its actions through independent and in-depth inspection and investigation mechanisms, among them the Fact Finding Assessment mechanism,” it said, adding that in cases where “an allegation of unlawful harm to civilians is raised, including against journalists, an investigative procedure is initiated to clarify the allegation.”  
  

      “In cases where there is reasonable suspicion of a criminal offense, a criminal investigation will be opened,” the Israeli military said.  
  

      But Sherif Mansour, CPJ’s Middle East and North Africa program coordinator, said, “The degree to which Israel claims to investigate journalist killings depends largely on external pressure,” according to the press release.   
  

      “There are cursory probes into the deaths of journalists with foreign passports, but that is rarely the case for slain Palestinian reporters. Ultimately, none has seen any semblance of justice,” Mansour added.   
  

      “The killing of Shireen Abu Akleh and the failure of the army’s investigative process to hold anyone responsible is not a one-off event,” Robert Mahoney, CPJ’s director of special projects and one of the report’s editors, was quoted as saying in the press release.    
  

      “It is part of a pattern of response that seems designed to evade responsibility. Not one member of the IDF has been held accountable in the deaths of 20 journalists from Israeli military fire over the last 22 years,” Mahoney said.

22,Iran executes two people convicted of blasphemy,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/08/middleeast/iran-blasphemy-executions-intl/index.html,"      Yusef Mehrdad and Sadrullah Fazeli Zare were arrested in May 2020 and sentenced to death in April 2021 for running online “anti-Islam groups and channels,” Mizan said.
  

      Authorities convicted both after they were found to be members of a Telegram channel titled “Critique of Superstition and Religion,” according to the US Commission on International Religious Freedom.
  

      Members of the Telegram channel allegedly shared opinions insulting Islam. One member allegedly said that they set religious books on fire, the US Commission on International Religious Freedom claimed. Iran’s state-run AlAlam said Mehrdad was filmed burning the Quran.
  

      Zare and Mehrdad were denied family visits and phone calls for eight months after their arrest. Mehrdad reportedly went on hunger strike in February 2022 to protest the authorities’ refusal to allow him to make phone calls, the US Commission on International Religious Freedom said.
  

      United Nations experts have previously called on Iran to stop the persecution of religious minorities, under what they described as a policy of targeting dissenting beliefs and religious practices, including Christian converts and atheists.
  

      “Such state-sanctioned intolerance furthers extremism and violence. We call on the Iranian authorities to de-criminalize blasphemy and take meaningful steps to ensure the right to freedom of religion or belief,” the experts said in a statement published in August.
  

Iran's regime is trying to execute its way out of trouble 


      The executions come days after the execution of a dual Swedish-Iranian national, Habib Chaab, who was convicted for leading a national Arab separatist group accused of attacks in Iran.
  

      A joint report issued by the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR) and the France-based Together Against the Death Penalty (ECPM) revealed at least 582 executions were carried out last year – a 75% increase from the previous year.
  

      It was the highest number of executions in the Islamic republic since 2015, according to the report released last month.
  

      The report found there was a “surge” of executions in Iran following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody in September. Amini’s death sparked a months-long national uprising, which was eventually quashed by a brutal police crackdown.

23,EU cancels Israel reception to avoid far-right minister Ben Gvir,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/08/middleeast/european-union-cancels-israel-reception-intl/index.html,"      “Regrettably, this year we have decided to cancel the diplomatic reception, as we do not want to offer a platform to someone whose views contradict the values the EU stands for,” the EU delegation to Israel said on Twitter.
  

      “We don’t endorse the political views of Mr. Ben Gvir,” EU foreign policy spokesman Peter Stano had said earlier on Monday. “We don’t endorse the political views of his party because they are in stark contradiction with all the values the European Union stands for and believes in.”
  

Ben Gvir – the leader of the nationalist Jewish Power party, who has been convicted of inciting anti-Arab racism — fired back that the EU was practicing “undiplomatic gagging.”
  

      “It is a shame that the European Union, which claims to represent the values ​​of democracy and multiculturalism, practices undiplomatic gagging,” Ben Gvir said in a statement. “It is an honor and a privilege for me to represent the Israeli government, the heroic IDF soldiers and the people of Israel in every forum, friends know how to voice criticism and true friends also know how to hear such.”

      The decision for the EU to call off the reception went to the top of the bloc’s foreign policy leadership, an EU diplomat told CNN Monday.
  

      EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell “was directly involved,” the diplomat said, asking not to be named discussing internal EU deliberations.
  

      The diplomat said the EU was mystified by the Israeli government decision to send Ben Gvir to the reception.
  

      “Nobody understands why – who had this genius idea, which is not doing good to anybody,” the diplomat said.

24,A change in Turkish leadership might not spell the end of ties with Russia,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/08/middleeast/turkey-foreign-policy-elections-russia-mime-intl/index.html,"      At the height of election campaigning and just three weeks before polls were set to open, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin inaugurated Turkey’s first nuclear plant in a virtual ceremony, in a move that further tethered the two Black Sea neighbors.  
  

      The event last month saw the inaugural nuclear fuel delivery at the Akkuyu plant in Mersin province, which is the first in the world to be built, owned and operated by one company – that is Russia’s state atomic energy company Rosatom.  
  

      With that, Turkey extended its energy dependence on Moscow at a time when its North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies were reducing such links to deprive Russia of leverage against them. It entrenched Moscow’s presence in Turkey for the long term just as Erdogan was set to head into an election that some polls predict could push him out of power. 
  

      The strengthening ties between Erdogan and Putin have caused jitters in the West, with some watching the upcoming elections with anticipation of a possible Erdogan exit.  
  

      The Turkish strongman knows this. When the US Ambassador to Ankara Jeff Flake paid a visit in March to Erdogan’s main electoral rival, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, Erdogan lashed out against him, calling the US diplomat’s visit a “shame,” and warning that  Turkey needs to “teach the US a lesson in this election.” 
  

      Polls suggest a tight race between Erdogan and Kilicdaroglu, with the likelihood of the May 14 election going into a second ballot if no candidate wins a majority vote. 
  

Turkey's upcoming elections could unseat Erdogan. Here's everything you need to know 


      But analysts have said that even if Erdogan is ousted in the polls, a foreign policy u-turn for Turkey is not a given. While figures close to the opposition have indicated that if victorious, it would reorient Turkey back to the West, others say core foreign policy issues are likely to remain unchanged. 
  

      Over the past two decades, Erdogan’s Turkey has repositioned itself from a staunchly secular, Western-oriented nation to a more conservative, religiously oriented one. A NATO member that has the alliance’s second-largest army, it has strengthened its ties with Russia, and in 2019 even bought weapons from it in defiance of the US. Erdogan has raised eyebrows in the West by continuing to maintain close ties with Russia as it continues its Ukraine onslaught, and has caused a headache for NATO’s expansion plans by stalling the membership of Finland and Sweden. 
  

      Turkey has, however, also been useful to its Western allies under Erdogan. Last year Ankara helped mediate a landmark grains export deal between Ukraine and Russia, and even provided Ukraine with drones that played a part in countering Russian attacks.  
  

      “I think there are areas where we will see radical change if the opposition wins, and many of our colleagues and European diplomats in Ankara are asking to what extent Turkey will pivot back to its Western allies,” said Onur Isci, an assistant professor of international relations at Bilkent University in Ankara, noting that if the opposition wins, the first thing it will do is mend fences with the West. 
  

      But even if relations with the West are repaired, there will be limits to Turkey’s pivot back to the West, he said, given how deeply intertwined Turkish and Russian economies have become, especially as regards energy. 
  

      Much of Erdogan’s foreign policy has been driven by economic considerations, Isci said. And that is likely to continue into the next government. 
  

      Turkey is a key trading partner for Russia, as well as a hub for thousands of Russians who fled after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, pouring money into real estate and other sectors.  
  

      Trade between the two has been on the rise, and last month Putin said that Russia was keen on deepening its economic ties with Ankara, noting that bilateral trade surpassed $62 billion as of 2022, according to the Russian state news agency TASS. That makes Russia among Turkey’s biggest trade partners. 
  

      The European Union, as a bloc, however remains Turkey’s largest trade partner, with bilateral trade reaching around $219 billion, according to the European Commission. Meanwhile, trade with the US stood at approximately $33.8 billion in 2022, according to the US Census Bureau.  
  

      Russia’s geographical proximity to Turkey, as well as its economic interests in Ankara, will probably mean that a different leader to Erdogan would still maintain good relations with Russia, while firmly anchoring Turkey within its Western democratic alliances, Murat Somer, a political science professor at Koc University in Istanbul, told CNN. 
  

      “In terms of the country’s outlook, it very much will be oriented towards the democratic West,” said Somer, noting that this would not mean a complete end to disagreements with Western countries. 
  

Erdogan's 'polar opposite' wants to replace him as president of Turkey 


      After several delays, Turkey this year allowed Finland to finally join NATO, but it continues to stand in the way of Sweden’s membership, saying it houses Kurdish “terrorist organizations,” referring to the militant Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which is designated as a terrorist group by Turkey, the US and the EU. 
  

      Issues over Sweden’s accession may, however, be resolved with or without Erdogan.  
  

      “It’s highly likely that no matter who wins the elections, Ankara will ratify Sweden’s membership later in 2023, after the new anti-terror legislation comes into force in Sweden,” Nigar Goksel, Turkey Director at International Crisis Group, told CNN. 
  

      The opposition has been keen to note that “constructive steps to eliminate Turkey’s security concerns” are essential if Sweden’s membership is to be approved. 
  

      But while relations with the EU might improve if the opposition wins, the road may be longer and more challenging with the US, experts say. 
  

      “When we mention Turkey’s relationship with the West… we sometimes take both ends of the Atlantic (as one),” Isci said. “Turkey’s relationship with the US has hit a dead end, and has been going downhill for a very long time.” 
  

      Whether Erdogan or the opposition wins, he said, Turkey will try to “disentangle its relationship with the US and the EU,” given Ankara’s reliance on its European trading partners.

25,More than 400 dead in flooding in Democratic Republic of Congo,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/08/africa/flooding-congo-dead-intl/index.html,"      Heavy rainfall through last week caused rivers to overflow and created mudslides that devastated the villages of Bushushu and Nyamukubi in South Kivu’s Kalehe territory, provincial governor Theo Kasi told CNN Monday.
  

      “We have 401 deaths in Bushushu and Nyamukubi villages in Kalehe territory,” Kasi said.
  

      Videos from the area show buildings swept away in the water and mud, with debris strewn across the villages.
  

      Valet Chebujongo, an activist in Kalehe, told CNN that rescuers have been unable to clear the muddy roads, leaving residents with the dangerous option of wading through lakes.
  

      “The Congolese government and its partners should find a safe place where the victims will be relocated and ask the population not to use the flowing waters and the lake during this period,” Chebujongo said, adding that there are “no machines to clear the mud and clear the landslides in the road to allow the population to circulate Bushushu-Nyamukubi villages. People are crossing the lake, another danger.”
  

      Kasi said rescue operations were ongoing in spite of difficulties. “We are in a disaster. We work despite difficult conditions,” he said.
  

      The provincial government said Saturday it was relocating residents affected by the floods to safer sites. It also said the government was funding medical care for the injured, including funeral costs for the deceased.
  

Floods kill at least 120 in Kinshasa


      President Felix Tshisekedi declared Monday a national mourning for victims of the floods, government spokesman Patrick Muyaya said, adding that a national government delegation had arrived in Kalehe to assist local response efforts.
  

      The DRC is located within the River Congo Basin where flood disasters are frequently reported. According to a World Bank report, climate-related disasters, including flooding “are likely to increase in frequency and magnitude” in the Central African country due to climate change.
  

      The DRC continues to grapple with devastating effects of flooding across the country. In December, more than 120 people were killed after heavy rains caused severe flooding in the Congolese capital of Kinshasa, authorities said.
  

      In 2020, more than 15,000 homes were destroyed and at least 25 people killed by floodwaters in South Kivu, a province already ravaged by armed conflict, the UN Refugee Agency reported at the time.

26,Nigerian senator jailed for nine years in UK organ harvesting plot,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/africa/nigeria-senator-ekweremadu-sentenced-intl/index.html,"      Senator Ike Ekweremadu, his wife Beatrice and Dr. Obinna Obeta were sentenced at the UK’s Central Criminal Court, known as the Old Bailey, to nine years and eight months, four years and six months, and 10 years in prison respectively in the first conviction of its kind under Britain’s modern slavery laws. 
  

      The three were found guilty in March of trafficking a 21-year-old street trader to the UK to provide a kidney for the Ekweremadus’ daughter Sonia, who according to the CPS statement suffers from deteriorating kidneys and needs regular dialysis.
  

Nigerian senator guilty of organ harvesting plot, UK court rules 


      Prosecutors said the victim was brought to the UK after being offered a reward of up to £7,000 ($8,810) and the promise of work in the country, but was unaware that he was expected to provide a kidney in return.
  

      A medical consultant called off the planned transplant after becoming suspicious of the circumstances surrounding it and the victim fled, sleeping rough for days before reporting the plan to UK police last May, the CPS said.
  

      “This was an horrific plot to exploit a vulnerable victim by trafficking him to the UK for the purpose of transplanting his kidney,” Joanne Jakymec, Chief Crown Prosecutor, was quoted as saying. 
  

      “The convicted defendants showed utter disregard for the victim’s welfare, health and well-being and used their considerable influence to a high degree of control throughout, with the victim having limited understanding of what was really going on here,” she continued. 
  

      Detective Inspector Esther Richardson, from the Met’s Modern Slavery and Exploitation Command said: “This is a landmark conviction and we commend the victim for his bravery in speaking against these offenders.”
  

      Ekweremadu was a former deputy senate president in Nigeria for 12 years and his case elicited sympathy in Nigeria where some saw him and his wife as victims of circumstance who were desperate to help their sick daughter. 
  

      Some of the country’s political class wrote to the UK court appealing for leniency ahead of his sentencing, including Nigeria’s former President Olusegun Obasanjo. 
  

      President of the Nigerian Senate, Ahmad Lawan, said Wednesday he wrote to the British judiciary on behalf of Ekweremadu asking them to “temper justice with mercy.” 
  

      While Femi Gbajabiamila, the Speaker of Nigeria’s House of Representatives, described Ekweremadu as “a brilliant lawyer, a distinguished public servant and a dedicated family man.”

      The speaker of parliament of the West African regional bloc ECOWAS, Sidie Mohamed Tunis said he also written to the chief clerk of the Old Bailey Court seeking leniency for the Ekweremadus.
  

      Ekweremadu served as speaker of the ECOWAS parliament between 2011 and 2015. 
  

      But the calls for clemency failed to hold sway over the UK court and some in Nigeria questioned why high profile politicians were using their influence to advocate for a convicted criminal. 
  

      IPC Justice, a non-governmental organization dedicated to fighting corruption in politics wrote on Twitter: “… Nigeria has a reputation for not enforcing laws against political elites, which could lead to the perception of condoning criminal activity if the Speaker advocates for clemency for someone convicted of a serious crime.”

      “The diamond needs to come to South Africa. It needs to be a sign of our pride, our heritage and our culture,” said Mothusi Kamanga, a lawyer and activist in Johannesburg who has promoted an online petition, which has gathered about 8,000 signatures, for the diamond to be returned.

      “I think generally the African people are starting to realize that to decolonize is not just to let people have certain freedoms, but it’s also to take back what has been expropriated from us.”
  

      Officially known as Cullinan I, the diamond in the scepter was cut from the Cullinan diamond, a 3,100 carat stone that was mined near Pretoria.
  

      A smaller diamond cut from the same stone, known as Cullinan II, is set in the Imperial State Crown which is worn by British monarchs on ceremonial occasions. Along with the scepter, it is kept with the other crown jewels in the Tower of London.

      A replica of the whole Cullinan diamond, which is about the size of a man’s fist, is displayed at the Cape Town Diamond Museum.
  

      “I believe it should be brought back home because at the end of the day, they took it from us while they were oppressing us,” said Johannesburg resident Mohamed Abdulahi.
  

      Others said they didn’t feel strongly about it.
  

      “I don’t think it matters anymore. Things have changed, we’re evolving,” said local resident Dieketseng Nzhadzhaba.
  

      “What mattered for them in the olden days about being superior… it doesn’t matter to us anymore.”

28,Sudan’s first professional stage actress killed in shelling in Khartoum,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/04/africa/sudanese-actress-killed-khartoum-intl/index.html,"      The 80-year-old was killed after shells hit her home in Bahri, north of the capital, in fighting between the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces and the Sudanese army, her nephew told CNN.
  

      It is unclear if it was the RSF or the army that fired the shot that killed Abdel-Majid.
  

      Failed negotiations between Sudanese army head Abdel Fattah al-Burhan RSF and RSF leader Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo over a disputed power-sharing arrangement exploded into violence in mid-April, sparking a mass exodus of refugees from the country and resulting in the deaths of at least 528 people.
  

      Previous ceasefires and promises of peace talks between both leaders have failed to curb the ongoing conflict with eyewitness accounts of fighting in Khartoum reported on Thursday, despite a seven-day truce announced just days earlier.
  

      Abdel-Majid was buried in the grounds of a kindergarten where she worked, her nephew said, adding that it was unsafe to take her to a cemetery.
  

      The kindergarten is next door to Abdel-Majid’s home, where she was alone when the shelling took place.
  

      She was considered a pioneer of theater in Sudan and the country’s first professional stage actress, establishing a kindergarten in Bahri and becoming a teacher when she retired.
  

      Witnesses said the Sudanese army and the RSF are fighting using light and heavy weapons in the vicinity of the Presidential Palace – the most violent since the start of the clashes – as the conflict nears its fourth week. 
  

      At least 190 children have been killed and another 1,700 injured in the country since the violence broke out last month, according to reports received by UNICEF, the UN body’s Executive Director Catherine Russell said in a statement on Thursday. Due to the intensity of the violence, UNICEF was unable to confirm the estimates, she added.
  

      Jan Egeland, Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) warned on Wednesday that people trapped in battlefields are running out of water and food.
  

      “Families across Sudan, including those of our colleagues, are being torn apart, and having to choose between remaining trapped in the battlefield, or risking their lives to flee or reach an overcrowded hospital,” Egeland said in a statement.
  

       “They are running out of everything, including water, food, electricity, fuel, and cash. We need the international community to put as much effort into secure humanitarian access, regardless of ceasefire and in providing aid to millions of people as they have in evacuating their own citizens,” he added.
  

      The violence has triggered a mass exodus of refugees from Sudan, with the UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR) on Thursday warning that $445 million is needed to help the 860,000 refugees and returnees who could escape the country by October.
  

      According to a UNHCR statement, the plan was designed by “134 partners, including UN agencies, national and international NGOS and civil society groups” and includes a contingency strategy for new arrivals (refugees, returning refugees and others) to neighbouring countries.”

      At the same time, hundreds of evacuees arrived from Sudan in Nigeria on Wednesday after being held up for days at the Egyptian border for days, as reports over the chaotic border response to the uptick in evacuees continue. 
  

      The first contingent of 376 Nigerians were flown home in a military aircraft and a local carrier and arrived in the capital Abuja shortly before midnight, according to the Nigerians In Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM).
  

      Last week, more than 7,000 Nigerian nationals, mostly students fleeing the Sudan conflict had been left stranded at the Egyptian border due to the unavailability of visas, NIDCOM said while appealing to Egyptian authorities “to kindly allow the already traumatized travellers to transit to their final destinations.”

29,Canadian diplomat expelled from China in tit–for-tat measure,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/08/americas/canada-expels-chinese-diplomat-intl/index.html,"      In a statement Tuesday, China’s Foreign Ministry said it strongly condemned the expulsion of Toronto-based diplomat Zhao Wei, and as “reciprocal countermeasure,” would declare Jennifer Lynn Lalonde, a consul of the Consulate General of Canada in Shanghai, persona non grata. 
  

      Lalonde has been asked to leave China before May 13, according to the statement. 
  

      The tit-for-tat move marks a new low in a years-long deterioration of ties between the two countries and comes amid a period of rising concerns in Canada about Chinese influence, including public uproar over allegations that China attempted to meddle in Canada’s 2019 and 2021 elections.
  

      Hours after Beijing announced it would expel Lalonde, a Foreign Ministry spokesperson at a regular briefing threatened that China would “resolutely and forcefully respond” if the Canadian government “keeps acting recklessly” and accused Canadian media and some politicians of “fabricating false information.” 
  

      Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters in Ottawa on Tuesday that Canada would “not be intimidated” by Beijing’s reaction.
  

      “We will take whatever action is necessary to continue to protect our democracy and show that we’re standing up for our values and our principles. We understand there is retaliation but we will not be intimidated,” Trudeau said.
  

      Canada moved to expel Zhao on Monday, following mounting public pressure on the Canadian government to respond to revelations the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) found an accredited Chinese diplomat in the country had taken efforts toward targeting opposition lawmaker Michael Chong and relatives who may be in China. 
  

      The alleged targeting took place after Chong sponsored a motion to condemn China’s treatment of its Uyghur Muslim minority group. The intelligence was first reported by Canadian newspaper the Globe and Mail earlier this month.
  

Canada says 'all options on table' over claims China tried to interfere in election, harass lawmaker


      Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly on Monday said Ottawa “will not tolerate any form of foreign interference in our internal affairs. Diplomats in Canada have been warned that if they engage in this type of behaviour, they will be sent home.”
  

      Beijing has repeatedly denied accusations of political interference in Canada. 
  

      The two countries’ relations have already come under significant strain in recent years, in particular following Beijing’s detention of two Canadians in China in move widely seen as retaliation for Canada’s 2018 arrest of a Chinese businesswoman Meng Wanzhou.
  

      Beijing repeatedly denied that their cases were political retaliation, but the two men, former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor, were released on the same day Meng was allowed by Canada to return to China in 2021.
  

      There have also been growing public concern about alleged Chinese interference within the country, including through the operation of overseas police stations and policing of speech in the country, which has a large community of people with Chinese heritage.
  

      Allegations of Chinese interference in Canadian politics have become a growing challenge for the government of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who earlier this year initiated an investigation to identify and combat foreign interference in Canada’s elections and its democracy.
  

      Trudeau has said intelligence services had failed to brief him about the alleged targeting of Chong. His Foreign Ministry summoned Chinese Ambassador to Canada Cong Peiwu last week after the media reporting on the intelligence emerged.
  

      Chong, who represents the Wellington-Halton Hills district in Ontario, had called for Zhao’s expulsion and criticized Trudeau’s government for being too slow to act. 
  

      In a statement posted to Twitter on May 1, Chong said that he found out about the intelligence – which was referenced in a 2021 CSIS report – through the Globe and Mail report, despite having been briefed on general foreign interference threats by CSIS.  
  

      “Like many Canadians, I have family abroad. The PRC’s (People’s Republic of China) targeting of family abroad to intimidate and coerce Canadians here at home is a serious, national threat,” Chong wrote in the statement, in which he says he has family in Hong Kong.
  

      Chong was among several political figures sanctioned by China in March 2021 in what Beijing called a response to American and Canadian sanctions against individuals and entities in its western region of Xinjiang “based on rumors and disinformation.”
  

      China has been accused of committing serious human rights violations that may amount to crimes against humanity in its treatment of Uyghur and other Muslim minorities in the region. Beijing denies the claims, and rights groups have documented its efforts to quash international focus on the situation there.
  

      In February 2021, Canada’s parliament passed its non-binding motion saying China’s treatment of Uyghurs in the Xinjiang region constitutes genocide.
  

      China has yet to specify what “countermeasures” it may take in response to Zhao’s expulsion, but these could include a tit-for-tat expulsion of a diplomat at Canada’s mission in China. 
  

      Beijing is also widely seen to have a track record of using economic or trade-related measures to express displeasure with diplomatic partners. 
  

      The expelled diplomat Zhao was listed in the Department of Global Affairs’ record of foreign diplomats as working in China’s Toronto consulate, the Globe and Mail reported earlier this month. 
  

      His name was not visible in a CNN search of the directory of China’s foreign representatives Monday night.
  

      Prior to naming Zhao as “persona non grata” Monday, Foreign Affairs Minister Joly last week said Canada’s government needed to carefully weigh how China might react to a Canadian response.
  

      China would “of course” take action against Canada’s “economic interest, consumer interest and also diplomatic interests,” Joly told parliamentarians on Thursday, adding that, “I know that we are under pressure to go fast, (but) we need to make sure as well that we protect our democracy.”

30,"Brazilian politician David Miranda has died at age 37, says husband Glenn Greenwald",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/09/americas/brazil-david-miranda-died-intl-latam/index.html,"      “It is with the most profound sadness that I announce the passing away of my husband @DavidMirandaRio. He would have turned 38 tomorrow. His death, early this morning, came after a 9-month battle in ICU. He died in full peace, surrounded by our children and family and friends,” tweeted Greenwald, who raised two adopted sons with Miranda. 
  

      Miranda was elected as one of the first openly gay city councilors in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, and went on to serve in Brazil’s congress from 2019. Miranda withdrew his candidacy for reelection in September 2022 after six weeks in the ICU suffering from a gastrointestinal infection, according to CNN affiliate CNN Brasil.
  

      His death led to an outpouring of tributes online. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva called Miranda “a young man with an extraordinary trajectory who left too soon,” on Twitter.  
  

      “David was singular: the strongest, most passionate, most compassionate man I’ve known,” Greenwald tweeted.   
  

      “He inspired so many with his biography, passion, and force of life,” he wrote.
  

      Miranda’s mother died when he was five years old, according to Greenwald, “leaving him an orphan” in Rio’s poor neighborhood of Jacarezinho.
  

      Greenwald has been at the forefront of high-profile reports for exposing secrets in US intelligence programs. With the cooperation of former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, Greenwald broke the story of the existence of a US National Security Agency program that is thought to have collected large amounts of phone and Internet data.  
  

      In 2013, Miranda was detained and interrogated at London’s Heathrow Airport for nine hours by British security forces under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 as he was flying back to Rio from Berlin. 
  

      While in Berlin, Miranda stayed with filmmaker Laura Poitras, who has worked “extensively” with Greenwald on his stories about the National Security Agency, the reporter wrote at the time. 
  

      The Guardian newspaper revealed that it paid for Miranda’s flights to Germany. “Miranda is not a Guardian employee but often assists Greenwald in his work,” the newspaper said at the time.  The UK authorities confiscated Miranda’s laptop and thumb drives. 
  

      According to a profile from TIME magazine, Miranda met Greenwald in 2005 “when he was playing volleyball on Ipanema beach and accidentally knocked over an American tourist’s drink. That tourist was attorney Glenn Greenwald, better known today for his journalism.”
  

      The pair “fell in love and moved in together after just five days.”
  

      “But by far David’s biggest dream, what gave him the greatest pride and purpose, was being a father. He was the most dedicated and loving parent,” Greenwald wrote on Twitter alongside images of their family. 
  

      “He taught me how to be a father. And our truly exceptional boys - with their own difficult start to live - is his greatest legacy,” he added.

31,Analysis: Three experts explain America’s gun politics,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/08/americas/guns-politics-allen-meanwhile-in-america-intl/index.html,"      At this point, it’s no surprise that there’s been another mass shooting in America.
  

      The latest tragedy came in Allen, Texas, on Saturday when a gunman opened fire on shoppers at an outlet mall. It was another horrific attack on people simply going about their lives, whether at shops, a bank, parties, schools, places of worship or even at their own homes.
  

      After every shooting, the political rituals are the same. Republicans who have harnessed their party to activists who want to loosen gun laws offer prayers for the victims and talk vaguely about a mental health crisis. Democrats demand more gun control and a ban on fast-firing assault weapons that can kill multiple people in seconds.
  

      But nothing ever changes.
  

      Is there any way out of this endless cycle of death? Or is the political system simply too deadlocked — even though majorities of Americans in most polls favor some kind of reform to gun laws.
  

      Meanwhile asked three expert contributors from CNN’s “Guns in America” unit about the implications of the latest horror and the state of guns politics in the country.
  

Jennifer Mascia is a senior news writer with “The Trace,” an independent news operation dedicated to covering America’s gun violence epidemic.
  

Meanwhile: Some state officials in pro-gun Texas have argued that since mass shootings also occur in liberal states with tighter gun laws, more restrictions would be not work. Is this true?


      Mass shootings do occur in states with tight gun laws, as we saw with Monterey Park and Half Moon Bay in California earlier this year. But the states with the loosest gun laws still tend to have higher rates of gun death.
  

      According to the most recent CDC figures, the states with the lowest rates of gun death (which includes both homicides and suicides) are Massachusetts, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island; California is 8th. Those states all have gun owner licensing, which means you must get a license or permit before you can even buy a gun. That process typically involves a thorough background check, interviews with law enforcement, character references, mandatory firearm training, and fingerprints. Gun owner licensing, also referred to as permit-to-purchase, is considered the most effective policy at reducing gun deaths.
  

Meanwhile: What are the states with the most deaths from firearms?


How US gun culture stacks up with the world 


      The states with the highest rates of gun death are Mississippi, Louisiana, New Mexico, Alabama, and Wyoming; Texas is 28th. With the exception of New Mexico, all of those states (including Texas) have enacted permitless carry, meaning gun owners are not required to get a license or undergo training in order to carry a concealed gun in public. There are 27 permitless carry states now, and studies have shown that gun violence rises after states loosen concealed carry requirements. A study last year from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health found that the average rate of gun assaults rose 9.5% in the first decade after 34 states relaxed their concealed carry restrictions. Missouri provides an interesting case study: Until 2007, the state required permits to purchase guns, like Massachusetts, California, and a dozen other states do. In the five years after permit-to-purchase was repealed, the murder rate rose 14%, one study found. Missouri further loosened its gun laws, enacting permitless carry in 2017. In 2019, the Kansas City Star found that the firearm death rate in Missouri had risen 58% since 2007, when the state eliminated permit-to-purchase.
  

Meanwhile: How does the US compare to the rest of the world?


      Bottom line: In terms of gun violence, you’re safer in California than you are in Texas. But you’re still safer in other countries than you are in California. That’s because, to quote UCLA law professor Adam Winkler, “California has the strictest gun laws in the US but some of the loosest, most permissive gun laws in the industrialized world.” And that explains why California still has mass shootings: Our strongest gun laws are still no match for those in Canada, the UK, Japan, Switzerland, or Israel, among others. Those countries are very careful who they allow to have guns and the screening process lasts many months. The only system that’s comparable is New York City’s gun permitting process, which is overseen by the NYPD.
  

Abené Clayton is the lead reporter for The Guardian’s “Guns and Lies in America” team
  

Meanwhile: Texas officials seemed to be very loath to offer many specific details about the mass shooting at the shopping mall. What is going on here?


      I believe that Texas—and most officials who are staunch gun rights and Second Amendment protectors—are working overtime to put distance between guns and the violence that we saw this weekend and continue to see daily. I believe that in addition to wanting to keep their voter base happy, many officials are genuinely afraid of armed resistance from extremists who own guns and are willing to die or create chaos if there is even a hint that there will be limitations put on gun ownership and retention.
  

      I also think that the lack of acknowledgment of broader issues of gun violence is meant to maintain the narrative that mass shootings are the result of spiritual warfare or innate evil. Conveniently for officials, neither of these factors can be legislated so it gives them the opportunity to point to a reason for shootings but take no accountability for supporting and creating solutions that will keep people safe.
  

Meanwhile: If local state officials won’t enact measures to stop massacres – or at least try to – what are their obligations for example in doing something meaningful to address mental health problems that they always cite – or to help mitigate the trauma of the victims?


      There are federal and some state victim assistance programs specifically geared toward people of mass violence and terrorism. (…) I think that state officials need to support, empower, and uplift survivors of mass shootings even though some become politically activated around issues—like red flag laws and assault weapon bans—that may not be palatable for right-leaning legislators’ bases.
  

      Politicians like Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz — both Republicans — and all the local and state officials that refuse to have good faith arguments about gun violence prevention solutions (outside of more police and school hardening) need to at minimum show genuine care to the people who lose loved ones and are irreparably injured following a shooting.
  

Stephen Gutowski founded the “The Reload” — a subscriber publication set up to provide sober, informed reporting on gun ownership in the United States.
  

Meanwhile: Is there any chance that the country’s fractured politics can produce anything to stop this cycle of shootings?


      There is broad agreement that more needs to be done to prevent mass shootings. The problem is that there’s little agreement between the parties on how to do that. Democrats generally favor broad gun restrictions and bans. Republicans generally favor stricter enforcement of current gun laws and mental health intervention. There is likely some crossover on either point among voters but little among their elected representatives.
  

      If these high-profile killings continue to increase, and they are happening at a record pace this year regardless of what count you look at, it could increase pressure for new gun restrictions. That’s what led to last year’s federal gun-control law. But there’s little reason to think it could result in a new national ban on AR-15s or other firearms because there is no support for that among congressional Republicans, and there is unlikely to be even 50 votes for it in the Senate since some Democrats also oppose a ban.
  

Meanwhile: Where is the action to watch on gun policy legislation?


      State-level policy is becoming increasingly polarized based on the prevailing politics in each state. Red states are focused on reducing attacks by making it easier for law-abiding citizens to obtain and carry guns. Blue states have turned increasingly to bans on “assault weapons” and ammunition magazines that hold a certain amount of ammunition. “Red Flag” laws that allow officials to temporarily seize guns from people determined by a judge to be a threat to themselves or others have mostly caught on in Democratic strongholds.
  

      But Tennessee’s Republican Gov. Bill Lee is attempting to address some of those concerns in a new proposal the Republican-controlled legislature is set to debate in a special session. If they can craft a policy addressing gun rights advocates’ concerns, that could create momentum for the policy in other states. That makes this gun policy debate the most noteworthy at the moment.

32,"Cold, hungry and determined: Families climb freight trains to reach US border",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/08/americas/mexico-migrants-border-train/index.html,"      One father, Leuman Varela, told CNN he, his wife and their four children had spent four days and nights on top of the train, traveling hundreds of miles as they fled from their native Venezuela.
  

      “This is for the brave, this is tough,” he said, his young son, Luca, on his shoulders. “Putting your family in danger is hard, but God has been with us – he has been helping us, to give us strength.”
  

      The people on top of the freight trains have no shelter from the day’s blazing sun and the night’s brutal cold as they travel north from southern Mexico to cities along the US border.
  

      “We’ve been hungry, cold, hot, but here we are chasing the American dream, for a better life for our family,” Varela said.
  

      As they clambered down from the tanks and rail cars in the Mexican border city of Ciudad Juárez, many of the people smiled with apparent relief to get their feet back on solid ground. They were some of the thousands of people arriving with the hopes of entering the US, some aware that a pandemic-era immigration restriction called Title 42 is set to end, others not. 
  

      But one mother was afraid – her leg shaking as her husband and teenage sons pleaded impatiently with her to get off the train. They held her hand and were there to catch her when she finally climbed down a metal ladder in her pink plastic sandals. 
  

      Her son, Leonardo Luzardo, said it had been a long, cold night atop the train, feeling like their bodies were turning to ice. 
  

      “It seemed like we were going to freeze,” he told CNN. “Our feet frozen, frozen, – the whole body frozen.”
  

      Luzardo, from Chile, said he and his family would stay the night in Ciudad Juárez, which straddles the border near El Paso, Texas, and planned to cross into the United States the next day.
  

      “We’ll try to take a shower and get ready so we’re not that dirty.”
  

      Some aid groups and shelters do offer food and facilities, but a hose spewing water near the tracks was a welcome sight for a group of women who stopped to quench their thirst and wash their hands and faces free of the dirt from hours on top of the train. 
  

      The Varela family from Venezuela said they, too, would head to the border after a night’s break in their journey. They had managed to register with the CBP One app launched by US Customs and Border Protection to allow people a chance to get an appointment for an entry interview – at least if they had access to the internet and were lucky enough to find an available slot.
  

      The Varelas did not have an appointment, but they protected a printout of an automated email reply in a plastic bag and hoped it would be enough to help them enter. 
  

      The renewed focus on the border has centered on the lifting of Title 42 and the end of the policy that allowed the government to quickly turn away certain migrants at the border, originally with the aim of stopping the spread of Covid-19.
  

      Some families told CNN they had been waiting months for the right time to enter the US, setting up makeshift tent encampments on the streets of this border city. 
  

      “I want to cross, but not illegally,” said Janeysi Games, who reached Ciudad Juárez with her husband and daughter after taking a series of trains. 
  

      A fire in Ciudad Juárez several weeks ago has made matters even harder, she said.
  

      “We’re waiting to see how we can get an appointment through the CBP app,” she said as she washed clothes with her daughter under a blanket tied to a wall to create some shade. “We were at a building that caught fire and I lost my documents and my cellphone, so I don’t know how to get the appointment.”
  

More than 100 migrants found aboard train in Texas, days before border policy expires 


      For the new arrivals on the freight train, there is still another 25 miles to the border. 
  

      And ahead for those planning to cross away from border posts, are coils and coils of barbed wire, recently laid down by the Texas National Guard in the area before a section of border wall. 
  

      Two women approached the wire as CNN watched. One used a jacket to pull back the barbs as the other clawed her way through the dirt underneath. When both were through, they embraced and walked off together, likely to hand themselves in to US border authorities. 
  

      Snagged and torn clothing in the wire showed they were not the first to get through. And with more and more people arriving all the time in Ciudad Juárez, they will not be the last.

33,US opens embassy in Tonga amid China’s increasing influence in Pacific islands,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/asia/us-opens-tonga-embassy-intl-hnk/index.html,"      The announcement came the same day the White House confirmed President Joe Biden will travel to Papua New Guinea during a trip to the Indo-Pacific region later this month, marking the first visit of a sitting US president to the Pacific country.
  

      US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller described the Tonga embassy opening as symbolizing “the renewal of our relationship and underlines the strength of our commitment to our bilateral relations, to the people of Tonga, and to our partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region.”
  

      US Vice President Kamala Harris had announced the Biden administration’s intent to open the Tonga embassy, along with one in Kiribati, last year during the the Pacific Islands Forum leaders’ meeting.
  

      “These actions advance the Biden-Harris administration’s ongoing efforts to strengthen the US-Pacific Islands partnership and to support Pacific regionalism,” the White House said in a statement at the time.
  

      The embassy in the Tongan capital Nuku’alofa is the second Washington has opened in the Pacific islands this year, following the reopening of one in the Solomon Islands in February.
  

      Plans are also underway to open an embassy in Vanuatu, the State Department said in March.
  

China sees Pacific islands as 'equals', US sees a 'backyard', claims Beijing's former envoy 


      Tonga is a nation of 171 islands in the South Pacific about two-thirds of the way from Hawaii to New Zealand, according to the CIA’s World Fact Book.
  

      Only 45 of those islands are inhabited, and two-thirds of Tonga’s population of 105,000 lives on the main island of Tongatapu.
  

      The country is considered upper income for Pacific island nations, but much of its wealth comes from remittances from overseas diaspora, according to the CIA, which also notes it is seeing “rapidly growing Chinese infrastructure investments.”
  

      That is that kind of influence from Beijing the Biden administration is trying to offset by opening the embassy in Nuku’alofa and in the other Pacific island nations.
  

      Last fall, the White House announced the first-ever US national strategy for the Pacific islands, which includes the increased diplomatic presence, more US Coast Guard and military deployments to the region, programs to fight climate change, and efforts to boost infrastructure as well as education.
  

      Beijing’s growing influence in the South Pacific has unsettled Washington, which sees the islands as a strategic link between the US territory of Guam and Australia and fears Beijing is becoming more aggressive in pursuing its agenda in the region while seeking to gain a military foothold.
  

Analysis: Why the sparsely-populated South Pacific islands have become the next US-China contest


      Biden’s upcoming trip to Papua New Guinea will take place between stops in Japan and Australia, according to White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, who called the partnership between the US and Pacific Island countries “critical.”
  

      Jean-Pierre touted “deep historical and people-to-people ties” between the US and Pacific Island countries.
  

      Analysts say the Pacific island nations have a strategic military value for the US and its ally Australia.
  

      “The islands sit astride a key passageway for US and Australian naval ships and merchant ships,” Timothy Heath, a senior international defense researcher at the RAND Corporation, told CNN last year. 
  

      “If China could establish (military) basing rights, it could deploy warships and aircraft temporarily to the islands. (Its) ships and airplanes could threaten US and Australian ships and aircraft that passed by,” he said, adding that even a boosted presence, short of a military one, could help China “collect sensitive intelligence on US and Australian military operations.”

34,Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan arrested by paramilitary police,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/09/asia/imran-khan-arrest-intl/index.html,"      The dramatic and sudden arrest of the former cricket star turned leader is the latest chapter in months of ongoing political turmoil in the nuclear armed nation after Khan was ousted last year.
  

      According to court documents seen by CNN, Khan was arrested in Islamabad on charges brought by the National Accountability Bureau, the country’s anti-corruption agency.
  

      He was submitting his biometric data for a court appearance when paramilitary forces broke down a window to get to him before apprehending him, as seen in a video provided to CNN by his party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).
  

      In the video, paramilitary forces attacked Islamabad High Court premises before arresting Khan who watched impassively at the unfolding chaos while wearing dark sunglasses.
  

      A separate video sent to CNN by PTI showed paramilitary troops piling out of cars and holding batons before the arrest. 
  

      A violent protest broke out in the Pakistan city of Quetta Tuesday evening local time, following Khan’s arrest, where a CNN journalist saw an Imran Khan supporter shot dead by police.
  

      The person was killed when police fired warning shots towards a crowd of people charging toward a military checkpoint. Protesters threw stones at police and torched a police van while chanting against the government and army.
  

      Several arrests were made at the scene, which remains tense.
  

      Khan said he was “detained on incorrect charges” in a pre-recorded statement released on YouTube by PTI after his arrest.
  

      “By the time you will receive these words of mine, I will have been detained on incorrect charges, Pakistan constitution, which gives us rights, which gives us democracy, has been buried. Perhaps I won’t get the opportunity to speak to you again.”
  

      Khan claims in the video statement, “I have always followed the law. I am being apprehended so that I can’t follow my political path for this country’s fundamental rights and for me to obey this corrupt government of crooks which has been hoisted on us.”
  

      Khan appealed to his supporters to “come out for your fundamental rights; no nation is handed its freedom on a plate; the time has come for all of you to come and struggle for your rights.”
  

      PTI spokesperson Fawad Chaudhry described Khan’s arrest as an “abduction” and said he had been “whisked away by unknown people to an unknown location.”
  

      Khan, 72, was ousted in a parliamentary no-confidence vote last year and has since led a popular campaign against the current government led by Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif, accusing it of colluding with the military to remove him from office.
  

      He has faced a growing raft of legal cases filed against him and multiple arrest warrants have been made, triggering confrontations with his supporters.
  

      Khan faces multiple allegations of corruption while he was in office, which he has rejected as “biased.” He says the charges against him are political.
  

      In March, the streets outside his residence in Lahore became something of a pitched battle between police and his supporters after officers attempted to arrest Khan for not showing up to court on corruption charges.
  

      Supporters hurled stones and projectiles at police while people inside Khan’s residence lit fires after officers fired tear gas into the compound.
  

      Police later cut the electricity supply to Khan’s home and turned street lights off in the neighborhood. The operation was eventually called off.
  

      The cricket legend-turned-politician has accused Pakistani authorities of attempting to arrest him to remove him from the playing field ahead of a general election scheduled for October.
  

      “[The government], they’re petrified that if I come into power, I will hold them accountable,” Khan told CNN during the unrest outside his residence in March. 
  

      “They also know that even if I go to jail, we will swing the elections no matter what they do.”
  

      In the midst of the ongoing political jostling Pakistan is facing an acute economic crisis. 
  

      The government has been trying to reach an agreement with the International Monetary Fund to restart a $6.5 billion loan program that has stalled since November, in an effort to keep the economy afloat.
  

      The fund has presented a set of conditions in exchange for the release of a $1.1 billion loan installment. It includes liberalizing the rupee’s exchange rate and raising taxes.
  

An economic crisis in Pakistan means many are going hungry during Ramadan


      One third of Pakistan’s farmland was affected after catastrophic floods last summer. According to the International Rescue Committee, 33 million people in Pakistan were affected by the severe flooding that has caused $40 billion in economic damage.
  

      Inflation has soared in recent months, with ordinary good becoming increasingly unaffordable. 
  

      Pakistan’s consumer price index rose to a record 35% in March from a year earlier, according to official figures.
  

      The March inflation number eclipsed February’s 31.5%, the statistics bureau said, as food, beverage and transport prices surged up to 50% compared to last year. Staples like the price of flour, a staple of Pakistani diets, has doubled over the past year, according to the bureau.
  

      According to a survey conducted by Gallup & Gilani Pakistan, just under three quarters of 2,000 respondents think the country’s economic situation has gotten worse over the last six months.

35,Japanese dog hailed a hero for saving the life of heart attack victim at a riding school,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/09/asia/japan-life-saving-dog-intl-hnk/index.html,"      Koume, a 5-year-old mongrel, was handed an official letter of appreciation by local fire officials at a special ceremony last month for her valiant work at a horse riding club in Wakaba-ku, Chiba City. 
  

      According to the horse riding club, a man in his fifties collapsed at the riding park on February 25. Koume, a usually placid pup, raised the alarm with her barks which then allowed people to rush to the man’s aid. 
  

      “Koume is usually quiet and barks only under rare circumstances,” Yuna Maruo, a 23-year-old riding instructor who took part in saving the man that day, said. “But when an emergency arises, Koume does bark.”
  

      The Wakaba Fire Department said life saving treatment can be given to heart attack victims if people are alert to “the slightest change.” 
  

      “Koume’s action in calling for help and the staff’s actions were a perfect response,” a fire department official said.
  

      According to the club, Koume’s barks enabled staff to quickly call an ambulance and paramedics used an automated external defibrillator on the rider just in time.
  

      The man has since returned to riding at the club. 
  

      The club said it had employed female canines as their “mascots” to greet members for generations. 
  

      According to Maruo, Koume has previously drawn attention to a horse trying to flee the facility by jumping a fence and when another old horse was having difficulties standing on its own.
  

      Koume grew up under the nurturing of another pooch called Ume, who Maruo believes helped teach her how to call for help in the time of a crisis.
  

      Koume’s mentor has since passed away, but the riding instructor said: “Ume must be happy in heaven”.

36,Sri Lanka Supreme Court clears path to decriminalize homosexuality,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/09/asia/sri-lanka-decriminalize-homosexuality-supreme-court-intl-hnk/index.html,"      LGBTQ+ rights activists in Sri Lanka have been campaigning for years to change the law in a country where homosexuality is still punishable by a prison sentence and a fine, leading to the private member’s bill presented in parliament last month.
  

      The Supreme Court, after hearing more than a dozen petitions on both sides of the argument, ruled it was not unconstitutional, Speaker of Parliament Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena said.
  

      “The Supreme Court is of the opinion that the bill as a whole or as any provision thereof is not inconsistent with the constitution,” the speaker told parliament.
  

      The decision is seen as a “historic development that has created hope towards real change,” said Kaveesha Coswatte, an attorney-at-law and advocacy officer for iProbono in Sri Lanka, which supported many of the petitions backing the bill.
  

      Activists will still have to lobby for support from the 225 parliamentarians to push forward the proposed legislation through parliament.
  

      Neither the government nor the opposition have made any comment on whether they support the bill, proposed for consideration by an individual member of parliament, so the next steps for it to eventually become legislation, or not, are not yet clear.
  

      “But the door is finally open. This Supreme Court decision is major for the community in terms of any kind of progress they have seen over the last couple of years,” Coswatte added.

37,"In Turkey, a modern city sits alongside a mythical site",https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/canakkale-troy-turkey/index.html,"      An enormous wooden horse presides over the marina in Çanakkale, a small port city southwest of Istanbul.
  

      The clapboard animal is a mock-up of the Trojan Horse of mythological fame. Some may recognize this specific horse from the 2004 movie “Troy.”
  

      It was donated to the city by the film’s producers and there’s a reason for its seemingly random location. Çanakkale (pronounced cha-na-call-ay) stands adjacent to the archaeological site that was once the ancient city of Troy, best known as the setting of the Trojan War in Homer’s “Iliad.”
  

      “I spent 25 years digging there, and each year I appreciate it more,” C. Brian Rose, professor of archaeology at the University of Pennsylvania and author of “The Archaeology of Greek and Roman Troy,” tells CNN. “It’s somehow different from other sites.”
  

Turkey's Lycian Way: An epic hike with beautiful beaches at every turn


      There is plenty of evidence that its proximity to Troy – “Truva” in Turkish or sometimes called “Troya” – is important to Çanakkale’s identity. Statues, benches, signs and other elements bearing Trojan influences are scattered all over town. These are interspersed with references to a more modern conflict which was similarly important to the region: the terrible WWI battle of Gallipoli, which occurred on Turkey’s Gallipoli Peninsula a short ferry ride across the Dardanelles Strait on which Çanakkale sits.
  

      Çanakkale itself is a lively, charming place. Ferries come and go. Visitors explore the cobblestone streets of the old quarter which are lined with shops and restaurants. Cafes, bars and kebab spots are kept busy by students from the university. On warm summer nights, vendors hawk their wares on the marina boardwalk under the stoical gaze of the great wooden horse.
  

      These and many other delights are reason enough to visit the city, but its primary attraction is the Troy site itself, located 20 minutes south, outside the village of Hisarlik.
  

      According to myth, the Trojan War was a decade-long conflict between the people of Troy and the Mycenean Greeks that occurred some 3,000 years ago. It was supposedly waged by illustrious figures including Priam, Hector, and Paris on the Trojan side, and Menelaus, Agamemnon, Achilles and Odysseus on the other. It finally concluded when the Greeks – on Odysseus’ advice – constructed a great wooden horse, hid within it, then waited for the Trojans to bring it within the city walls as a trophy. Once inside, the Greeks poured out of the horse and laid waste to Troy.
  

      Today when you visit Truva – either via car or a short bus ride from Çanakkale – a second model of the Trojan Horse looms at the entrance. From there you embark on a path that weaves through and over what remains of the ancient stone walls and streets of Troy – much of which is impressively preserved or restored – and looks out across the fields below onto the waters of the Aegean Sea. If the myths are true, it was in this stretch between the city walls and the sea that the siege of Troy took place. 
  

      But how true can myths be?
  

      “We know that there were many wars that occurred at Troy,” Rose explains. “This is an area where there has been continual war linked to its geographic location because everyone wanted to hold the site.”
  

      Troy stood in a geopolitically vital position. It controlled the entrance to the Dardanelles Strait, which links the Aegean with the Marmara and Black Seas. It was also located upon one of the two easiest land crossings between continental Europe and Asia. Because of this, there was fierce competition to control it. There was conflict for 2,000 years, spanning the late Bronze Age (during which the Trojan Wars would have occurred), into the Persian Wars, and on through the Crusades in the medieval period.
  

      This was no provincial backwater, but an important crossroads in the region, visited by kings and emperors including Xerxes, Alexander the Great and the Roman emperor Augustus. According to famed Greek historian Plutarch, Alexander made a pilgrimage to the temple of Athena Ilias here, where he made sacrifices at what was said to be the tomb of Homeric heroes Achilles and Patroclus. 
  

      According to Rose, by the time the Iliad was first written down in the eighth century BCE, what had in reality been 200 years of war between many combatants that took place over the course of the late Bronze Age was condensed into a war of 10 years’ duration involving two primary foes. So there is a historical foundation for the Trojan War? He nods: “Sure.”
  

After 7,000 years, Turkish wines are hitting the big time


      We even have evidence that many of the figures who participated in it were real.
  

      Only a single piece of writing from Bronze Age Troy has survived through the ages, says Rose. Clay tablets discovered at Hattusa, the nearby capital of the ancient Hittite people, mention “Wilusa” – their word for “Illios,” which was in turn the Greek word for “Troy” – and discuss diplomatic and military relations with the Mycenaean Greeks. There are even references to Atreus (Agamemnon’s father), Paris – who supposedly sparked the Trojan War with the abduction of the world’s most beautiful woman, Helen – and other characters from the Iliad.
  

      Rose calls the tablets, “a history book for what happened in western Asia Minor between the Greeks and Hittites.”
  

      At Truva, Rose and his team used MRI scanning to reveal key features of the city, including a pair of defensive systems that some have argued were directly referenced by Homer. This is difficult to verify, however.
  

      As he explains, what we today call Troy is in fact a multi-period site with 10 distinct layers of occupation, one atop another, spanning some 4,500 years. Over the millennia, it has been a place of many peoples and names.
  

      Regardless of vague timelines and dubious veracity when it comes to some of the specifics, a visit to Truva will be the experience of a lifetime for enthusiasts of the Homeric epics. You can look out from its walls over the ground where, according to legend, Achilles did battle with Hector and Odysseus concocted the ruse of the horse. You walk upon stones that were perhaps trodden by some of the greatest names of myth: Agamemnon and Priam, Helen and Cassandra, Paris and Nestor. And it was here that the root of nearly all Western literature to follow was planted.
  

Turkey was devastated by an earthquake. Here's what that means for tourism


      But you don’t have to be a student of the classics to enjoy Troy. The ruins themselves are impressive, the curation well done, and you can feel the presence of history throughout.
  

      What’s more, it lacks the crowds one typically encounters at historic sites of great importance. Here you can explore one of the significant flashpoints of history in peace.
  

      Nearby Çanakkale is an excellent place to spend two or three days if you’re visiting Troy. Compact enough to explore its downtown on foot, it has good food, cozy cafes, lively bars, pastry shops (for the obligatory baklava) and souvenir shopping, interspersed with reminders of its historic past.
  

      One particularly popular restaurant is Sardalye, where the specialty is locally caught fish and chips. Along the waterfront you’ll find numerous cafes, bars, and restaurants – Ziveriye Ocakbaşı is a great place to explore some traditional Turkish dishes accompanied by a terrace view of the Trojan Horse.
  

      Beyond that, Çanakkale is an easy place to simply walk and take in the atmosphere.
  

      “It’s a wonderful town,” says Rose. “I enjoy it enormously. It’s not overwhelmed with tourists so it has maintained its own unique charm. I view it as a perfect place for the exploration of the wars that have occurred in that spot in antiquity and the modern period. 
  

      “If you look on the Asian side in Çanakkale, you see the colossal wooden horse as a reminder of the first of the great east-west conflicts that occurred in this region. Directly opposite it on the European side you see the Gallipoli war memorial commemorating the last – thus far – of [them]. So when I think of Çanakkale I think of those two monumental bookends.”

38,"English island that inspired Agatha Christie is up for sale, along with its luxury Art Deco hotel",https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/agatha-christie-island-scli-gbr-intl/index.html,"      Burgh Island, located just off the coast of Britain’s south-westerly county of Devon, is on the market for “offers in excess of £15m” ($18.9 million), according to real estate agent Knight Frank. 
  

      The sandy tidal island, situated 18 miles from the port city of Plymouth, was where Christie wrote two of her best-known works, “And Then There Were None” and “Evil Under the Sun.”
  

      In the first, adapted as a TV miniseries starring Charles Dance in 2015, 10 strangers are invited to a mysterious island, where they are killed off one by one. The second sees Christie’s mustache-twiddling Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, investigate a murder on a Devon island. 
  

'Death on the Nile' powers past its baggage in a slick Hercule Poirot mystery


      Burgh Island’s official Twitter account describes the hotel as “home to the romantic ghosts of times past” with “infinite sea views, complete privacy with unbeatable #blacktieglam.”
  

      The 25-bedroom hotel, set within 21 acres, has been fully restored to be “one of the finest examples of working Art Deco architecture in Europe,” according to the agent.
  

      For those not arriving by helicopter, the island is accessible by foot or car at low tide, or by a sea tractor at high tide.
  

      The rooms and suites are named after former guests, among them “Agatha’s beach house.” Nestled against the island’s rock face, the beach house was originally built in the 1930s as a retreat for the writer. Nowadays, it has its own outdoor hot tub. 
  

      The hotel features a mermaid pool – a naturally enclosed body of sea water – a billiard room, sauna and treatment room and numerous bars and restaurants, as well as staff accommodation. 
  

      It also has planning approval for works to add 12 more guest bedrooms and 13 staff bedrooms. 
  

      Also on the island – and included in the sale – is The Pilchard Inn, a 14th-century tavern that originally served the fishermen who lived on the island and nearby mainland.
  

      Over the years, Burgh has been a popular escape for the rich and famous.
  

      Back in the 1890s, music hall star George H. Chirgwin built a wooden house on the island, where he would throw weekend parties for his guests. 
  

      In 1927, it was sold to film producer Archibald Nettlefold, who went on to build a more substantial hotel in the Art Deco style fashionable at the time. 
  

      The hotel was one of the most popular in the area during the 1930s, though during World War II it was transformed into a recovery center for wounded Royal Air Force personnel. 
  

Spectacular interiors of rediscovered Orient Express carriages revealed


      According to the hotel’s website, Christie made it her second home. Playwright and songwriter Noël Coward was among the host of other famous guests, originally checking in for three days, but staying for three weeks. 
  

      US President Dwight D. Eisenhower is rumored to have met with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill at the hotel before D-Day. Other well-known guests have included the Beatles and former British King Edward VIII and his American wife, Wallis Simpson. 
  

      Matthew Smith, partner in the Hotel Agency team at Knight Frank, said in a press release that “it is rare for a hotel of such character and heritage to come to the open market.”
  

      He added: “Burgh Island Hotel is a stunning example of Art Deco architecture, it’s steeped in amazing history and provides guests with a sophisticated and unique experience.”
  

      In a statement emailed to CNN, Burgh Island’s owner, Giles Fuchs, who oversaw an extensive renovation of the hotel, said: 
  

      “Having watched the hotel be reborn, survive the pandemic, and continue as a wild and beautiful oasis for visitors from across the world, I believe now is the time for me to step aside and allow a new chapter to emerge for Burgh. The sale includes the 14th-century Pilchard Inn as well as the hotel, which remains an important part of Devon’s history and I am excited to see what the future holds for this much-loved property.”

Lightweight and water-resistant, the bag comes in four colorways and features a trolley sleeve, a zip-top closure and an interior zippered pouch. The most thoughtful detail, however, is that the bag can fold into the included zippered pouch, which can also be used as a catchall for your lip balm, gum and phone.
If you want a bag that can do it all, look no further than the L*Space Voyager. Part sleek tote, part high-functioning cooler, the bag’s wicker-inspired basketweave is full of texture that can easily be wiped down, thanks to its faux leather fabric. In addition to a detachable crossbody strap — which is super helpful for hands-free travel days — the bag also comes with a removable aluminum cooler sleeve that can keep your beach beverages nice and chilled. 
There’s a lot to love about this roomy bag from Baggu. For one, it’s made from recycled nylon and has a zip-top closure. In addition to an interior zipped pocket, it’s also got a detachable interior pouch that's the perfect place to stash travel and pool accessories. Available in two colors, the bag also folds flat, taking up little to no room in your luggage when it's not in use.
A longtime New England favorite, Sea Bags are hand-sewn in Portland, Maine, and crafted from recycled sail cloth. As such, the water-resistant bags are chock-full of seafaring heritage — but they’re also ultra durable and great for beach and travel days alike. We love the Chebeague, which has handsome leather details on its handles, interior pockets and a zip-top closure.
Cute and affordable, this nylon zip-top bag is big enough to function as a weekender, but it can also fold flat when not in use. We love the removable crossbody strap, the pockets galore (including a zipped option on the interior) and the collegiate-inspired “beach” letter patches.
We’re huge fans of Dagne Dover’s signature neoprene bags, but when it comes to carry-on/beach options, the Jemi Tote is perfection. Lightweight and easy to clean, the Jemi is made from recycled water bottles and comes chock-full of travel bling like a 16-inch laptop sleeve, a key leash, two D rings, a luggage sleeve and five interior and exterior pockets. Love the puff but prefer a backpack? The Walker is your answer.

40,US airline passengers are getting increasingly frustrated. Here’s why,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/jd-power-2023-north-american-airline-satisfaction-survey-results/index.html,"      North American travelers are frustrated with high ticket prices, staffing shortages and reduced routes, according to consumer research company J.D. Power’s 2023 North American Airline Satisfaction Study.
  

      The survey finds overall North American airline passenger satisfaction at 791 out of 1,000, down seven points from the 2022 study – which wasn’t exactly a glowing result either.


      Michael Taylor, travel intelligence lead at J.D. Power, told CNN Travel that “continued high prices for travel” is the “biggest factor” in passengers’ dissatisfaction. 
  

      “This score continues to decline,” he said. 
  

      J.D. Power’s survey breaks down passenger satisfaction by cabin, with Southwest Airlines coming out on top for economy passengers for a second year in a row, with 827 points. Delta Air Lines came in second for economy travelers with 801 points, while JetBlue Airways is a close third with 800 points.
  

      Delta Air Lines is number one for premium economy passengers with 848 points, JetBlue Airways is number two for premium economy with 840, while Alaska Airlines rounds out the premium economy top three with 823 points.
  

      For those traveling first class or business, JetBlue topped the charts with a score of 893. Delta Air Lines ranks second for first class and business class travelers with 865 points, while United Airlines comes in third with 848 points.
  

      J.D. Power found that first class and business class passenger feedback was the most positive overall – and notably, upper tier travelers notably rated their flying experience more highly than last year. Taylor attributes this to reinstated business class and first class food and drink services following a pandemic-enforced hiatus.
  

      “In-flight services (food, beverage, entertainment) is the biggest factor for these upper-class cabins. It means more than the price they’re paying for the ticket,” said Taylor. “The ability to ‘get what is expected’ is sort of a rising tide that lifts all factors for these passengers.”
  

A flight attendant's secrets to surviving long-haul flights


      While compiling the survey, J.D. Power quizzed 7,774 travelers who’d flown with a major North America airline between March 2022 and March 2023.  As well as considering ticket cost and in-flight services, passengers were asked to rate airlines on aircraft, baggage, boarding, check-in, flight crew and reservation experience.
  

      According to Taylor, the most surprising result was the overall high score for flight crew. 
  

      “Being friendly and helpful when planes are jam-packed is difficult,” he said. “Usually, we see a decrease in scores when travel spaces are crowded and busy. Kudos to the airlines’ staff and crew for managing in a difficult time.”
  

      Taylor also has a message for unsatisfied passengers, advising them that aviation is still in an “unusual situation” due to “high demand and lack of crews to man flights” and the landscape will likely shift again.
  

      He also points towards a North American pilot shortage and its knock-on effects.
  

      “Planes will be fuller and there will be fewer options in air travel until more pilots can be trained and qualified,” he said.

41,MSG is the most misunderstood ingredient of the century. That’s finally changing,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/msg-changing-views-cmd/index.html,"      Case in point – he has the letters “MSG” tattooed on his arm, and his restaurant’s menu includes a signature drink called the MSG Martini. 
  

      “Things just taste better with MSG, whether it’s Western food or Cantonese food,” the chef tells CNN. 
  

      “We use it in drinks. We use it in desserts. We use it in savory food. It’s in almost everything. Salt, sugar and MSG – I always joke that they’re the Chinese Trinity of seasonings.”
  

      Openly admitting to using MSG – once a surefire way to keep your restaurant empty – certainly hasn’t undermined Bonnie’s success. It’s become one of the hottest tables in New York since opening in Williamsburg, Brooklyn in late 2021, winning numerous Best New Restaurant awards from multiple media outlets. 
  

      Eng himself was named one of the best new chefs of 2022 by Food and Wine Magazine and was included on the 2023 Forbes 30 under 30 list, just to name a few of his recent achievements.
  

      Eng is one of several celebrated chefs, including Momofuku’s David Chang and author/chef Eddie Huang, now embracing MSG and trying to destigmatize the century-old seasoning.
  

      “Growing up, it was taboo to use MSG,” says Eng. 
  

      “My mom would never use it, but she’d use chicken powder in her cooking. As a kid, I didn’t know they were like the same thing until I was old enough to care to know about it.”
  

      Here’s a quick recap of MSG’s history:
  

      In 1907, Japanese chemist Kikunae Ikeda boiled down a huge amount of kombu seaweed to extract a substance – glutamate. Why? It gives certain foods, like dashi broth, a long-lasting savory flavor. 
  

      He coined the taste “umami,” then broke the substance down into MSG, which as a crystallized substance can be used like salt and sugar. 
  

      A year later, businessman Saburosuke Suzuki acquired a joint share of the MSG patent and, with Ikeda, founded the company Ajinomoto to manufacture the seasoning.
  

MSG in Chinese food isn't unhealthy -- you're just racist, activists say


      It soon became an award-winning invention and a prized condiment, especially among middle-class housewives in Japan.
  

      In the decades to come, it became well-known around the world. 
  

      The US military even held the first-ever MSG symposium after World War II to discuss how the seasoning could be used to make tastier field rations and boost soldiers’ morale.
  

      But MSG’s fortunes began to go downhill in 1968, when a US doctor wrote a letter to a medical journal titled “Chinese Restaurant Syndrome.” 
  

      In the document, he described symptoms like “numbness in the back of the neck,” “general weakness” and “palpitations.” He suspected MSG, along with other ingredients like cooking wine and high amounts of sodium, may have caused these symptoms. 
  

      MSG took the biggest hit, with the effects of that letter rippling on throughout the decades, all over the world.
  

      Restaurants publicly swore off MSG. Food and beverage publicists begged not to be asked about it. Diners experiencing discomfort after a meal blamed it on MSG.
  

      “Many didn’t know that MSG is plant-derived,” says Tia Rains, a Chicago-based nutritional scientist and Ajinomoto’s vice president of customer engagement and strategic development. 
  

      “Our process [of making MSG] is by fermentation, which is very similar to how beer is brewed or how yogurt is made.”
  

      First, plants with sugar – like sugarcanes or corn – are fermented with microbes to create glutamate, an amino acid found in food that’s also produced in our body and acts as a neurotransmitter.
  

      Then, sodium is added and the glutamate is crystalized to become the salt-like MSG we see in supermarkets and kitchens now. 
  

      “I’m a scientist by training. I think how MSG works is one of the coolest scientific things,” says Rains.
  

      “We have different receptors on our tongue for different tastes. Our receptor for umami looks almost like a Venus Flytrap under a microscope,” she adds, mimicking a “C” with her hand.  
  

      “Glutamate is the amino acid that has the snug fit to that receptor.”
  

James Corden's 'Spill Your Guts' segment is facing criticism for being culturally insensitive


      So what’s umami? In recent years it’s been called “the fifth taste” – joining the more familiar tastes of sweet, sour, salty and bitter – and is often described as savory. 
  

      When the glutamate goes into the receptor, it causes an umami flavor sensation on our tongue. If the food has one of the two nucleotides – inosinate and guanylate – the glutamate is able to stick to the receptor for a longer period. 
  

      “In layman’s terms, if you want to make an umami bomb, combine the glutamate – which is the core in creating umami – with one of these nucleotides (inosinate and guanylate). It’s like getting multiple hits of umami to your brain,” Rains explains. 
  

      Sounds complicated? You’ve probably been playing with glutamate, inosinate and guanylate in your own cooking without even realizing it. 
  

      Carrots and onions (high in glutamate), for example, boost the umami-ness in beef (high in inosinate). Bonito fish (inosinate) and seaweed kombu (glutamate) also combine to create a powerful umami flavor. 
  

      Foods like tomatoes and cheese even have natural glutamate in them.
  

      “When people tell me that they ate at a Chinese food restaurant and they had trouble breathing and tightness in their chest, I get worried – and I’d say, ‘you need to follow up on that because MSG is not an allergen. It’s not going to cause an allergic response. Our bodies make glutamate, so it would not be possible to have an allergy to glutamate’,” says Rains.
  

      Despite continued claims of negative reactions to MSG from diners, decades of scientific trials have failed to prove the existence of MSG sensitivity. Government organizations around the world have listed MSG as safe to eat. This includes the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which lists MSG as “generally recognized as safe” (GRAS). 
  

      “Although many people identify themselves as sensitive to MSG, in studies with such individuals given MSG or a placebo, scientists have not been able to consistently trigger reactions,” says the FDA’s website. 
  

      The Centre for Food Safety in Hong Kong notes that using MSG could reduce sodium intake, which is known for health issues like high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke.
  

      “When used in combination with a small amount of salt during food preparation, MSG has been reported to reduce the total amount of sodium in a recipe by 20 to 40%,” said a food safety assessment carried out by a Hong Kong government scientific officer. 
  

      Yet negative opinions continue to permeate discussions on MSG, leaving the marketing team of Ajinomoto busy as it works to change attitudes.
  

      “All these years later, we haven’t really made a dent in sodium levels in the food supply, at least in the US,” says Rains. 
  

      “We’ve got a tool to help product developers get there and we’re not using it because of a silly, outdated, xenophobic and potentially racist negativity around a food ingredient that has been consumed for over 100 years. It was too big of a challenge to walk away from.”
  

      In 2020, the team successfully lobbied Merriam-Webster to change the definition of Chinese Restaurant Syndrome in its dictionary and has hosted symposiums to educate the public about MSG and umami.
  

      There’s even a visitors’ center at Ajinomoto’s oldest factory, in Kawasaki, where the remaining crystals of the first-ever MSG created by Ikeda more than a century ago are proudly on display. It also showcases the history of MSG and features a diorama that explains how MSG is made. 
  

      The tour, mostly in Japanese, is open to the public and is free of charge. Visitors, usually school children, bottle their own MSG keychains and shave bonito flakes to learn more about umami. 
  

      Then they tour the 370,000-square-feet complex on a panda bus – nicknamed after the company’s mascot, Ajipanda – while smiling staff wave them goodbye from the door. 
  

      Nowadays, chefs like Eng aren’t afraid of talking about MSG and listing it on their menus, which is helping to change outdated mindsets.
  

      “I think our clientele is a young crowd who understands MSG and isn’t afraid to consume it,” he says.
  

      “We’re proud to embrace the use of it to help destigmatize the reputation or negative connotation that it does have.”
  

      Health concerns aside, some diners simply view the use of MSG as a shortcut – an easy flavor enhancer. Eng disagrees with this take, noting their dishes are created the traditional way. 
  

      “We still make our stocks and broths with bones for hours. We season our food with MSG a little bit – it’s different from heating water and adding MSG and serving it with noodles,” he says. 
  

      Many of Bonnie’s dishes are classic Cantonese dishes but with playful and laborious twists. 
  

      For instance, the Charsiu McRib was inspired by two foods – the classic fast-food burger and a traditional Cantonese steamed black bean and ribs dish Eng’s mother – Bonnie – loves making. 
  

      To make the sandwich, Eng steams the ribs until the bones can be easily removed from the meat. Then he marinates the deboned rib meat with a house-made charsiu sauce – made with hoisin sauce, maltose, fermented red soy curd, MSG and more – overnight.
  

      When the meat is ready, it’s pressed and flattened out for a few hours before being glazed and roasted in the oven.
  

      Finally, Eng places a big slab of the rib meat, onions, pickles and mustard on a Cantonese “zyu zai” bun – a classic type of soft bun bought from his mom’s favorite Cantonese bakery in Chinatown.
  

      It’s been the hottest item on the menu since Bonnie’s opened.
  

      “Our mission from the very beginning was to show people what Cantonese food is and what Cantonese food can be – it’s always going to be playful, fun and approachable,” says Eng.
  

      But while opinions towards MSG may be slowly changing in the United States, the same can not be said for the rest of the world. 
  

      “Depending on where you’re at it could be very negative or very positive,” says Rains.
  

      The expert hopes that as the reputation of MSG improves in the United States, it may influence places where MSG is still a forbidden topic.
  

      “Negativity around MSG originated here in the United States,” says Rains. 
  

      “It wouldn’t be unreasonable to think that if we could make a dent here in the US, share the facts and have people understand the ingredient, that it may reverberate throughout the world in the future.”

42,Last Chinese emperor’s luxury watch expected to fetch $3 million,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/puyi-watch-auction-patek-philippe/index.html,"      The eye-watering valuation is partly due to the rarity of the Patek Philippe Reference 96 Quantieme Lune, one of just eight known to exist. But according to Phillips auction house, which is handling the sale, the seven-figure estimate is also down to the 86-year-old watch’s remarkable history — one that saw it taken to Siberia during the former ruler’s five-year imprisonment in the USSR.
  

Why this surreal 'dripping' watch has become a cult celebrity favorite 


      The 1.2-inch-diameter platinum timepiece features an Arabic numeral dial, pink gold hands and a “moon phase” function that shows how visible the moon is from Earth at any given time. Some of its internal mechanisms date to 1929, though the model was not sold by Patek Philippe — a Swiss watchmaker known for fitting complicated movements into slim cases — until 1937. 
  

      It is not known how Puyi acquired the timepiece, though records show it was initially sold via a luxury store in Paris. Phillips added that historical documents prove the former emperor took it with him to a Soviet prison camp in Khabarovsk. He later gifted it to Georgy Permyakov, a fluent Mandarin speaker who served as his tutor and Russian translator during his time in detention. 
  

      Puyi, whose life formed the basis of the Oscar-winning 1987 movie “The Last Emperor,” ascended the throne as a mere toddler in 1908. He was forced to abdicate less than four years later when a republican revolt overthrew the Qing dynasty, though he was permitted to continue living in the imperial palace in Beijing (and was briefly reinstated as emperor in 1917). 
  

      In 1924, he fled Beijing and formed an alliance with Japan, which later installed him as the emperor of its puppet state, Manchukuo, in northeast China’s Manchuria region. After Japan’s defeat in World War II, Puyi was captured by Soviet forces and held as a prisoner of war. According to Phillips, he gave the watch to Permyakov in 1950, just before the former emperor returned to China to face trial for war crimes. 
  

The Broker, The Astronaut and The Vampire: Enter the mysterious world of Soviet watch collectors


      According to a press release, Phillips spent three years researching the object’s history and confirming its provenance — a process that Thomas Perazzi, the auction house’s head of watches for Asia, described in a statement as an “unprecedented research project with a worldwide team of watch specialists, historians, journalists and scientists.” 
  

      In its catalog listing, Phillips cites Puyi’s nephew Yuyan (who was incarcerated alongside him) recalling in his memoirs that his uncle wore the watch “day to day” while in Manchukuo. The catalog also says that Puyi had previously gifted the watch to his nephew, but later asked for it back in order to give it to Permyakov. 
  

      Almost a decade after returning to China, Puyi was pardoned and lived as a civilian in Beijing until his death in 1967. Permyakov, meanwhile, kept the watch until he died in 2005, after which it was passed to his heirs before being consigned to Phillips by its current owner in 2019. The timepiece has already been displayed in New York, Singapore, London and Taipei, and will travel on to Geneva before returning to Hong Kong, where it will go on sale at Phillips’ new Asia headquarters on May 23. 
  

      The watch is being offered alongside several other of Puyi’s former possessions. Among them are 15 watercolors, attributed to Puyi’s brother-in-law Gobulo Runqi, and a red paper fan also given to Permyakov, featuring a poem inscribed by the former emperor. 
  

The incredible stories behind 5 of the world's most expensive watches


      One of Puyi’s manuscript notebooks, which Phillips says “provides a never-before-seen glimpse into (his) mind,” is also being sold alongside his copy of Confucius’ “The Analects,” with the two items expected to together fetch over $25,000. 
  

      The sale will be followed by a two-day watch auction at Phillips featuring some 240 timepieces. Among the historically notable items featured is a limited-edition Omega Speedmaster Apollo XI 1969 once presented to NASA astronaut Charles “Pete” Conrad Jr., the third person ever to walk on the moon.

43,A second day of soaking rains puts millions at risk of flash flooding in the South,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/weather/flash-flooding-south-houston-wednesday/index.html,"      Roughly 9 million people are under a flood watch, including the Houston metro area and parts of Louisiana.
  

      “Slow-moving thunderstorms within a moisture-rich environment will be capable of containing intense rainfall rates and lead to the threat of flash flooding through early Thursday,” warned the Weather Prediction Center. “Urban regions and flood-prone areas will be most at risk to rapid onset flooding, as well as locations that possibly experience over 5 inches of rain.” 
  

      A slow-moving area of low pressure will meander to the north through the day Wednesday, leading to the slow nature of these downpours and increasing the risk of flooding.  
  

      The prediction center has expanded the Level 3 out of 4 moderate risk of flash flooding for much of southeast Texas and western Louisiana, including Houston and Beaumont in Texas, and Lake Charles and Shreveport in Louisiana.
  

      The biggest concern will be where the heaviest downpours set up and have little movement. 
  

      These are called “training storms.” They dump tremendous amounts of rain on the same area, causing flash flooding and dangerous scenarios in an instant.  
  

      The Houston area could see an additional 2-4 inches of rain Wednesday, after as much as 4 inches of rain fell Tuesday in some areas. Some isolated locations could get up to 5-7 inches around the heaviest downpours.

      Farther north, near Shreveport, the heaviest downpours will begin to move in later Wednesday.  
  

      “Bottom line up front: A more significant rainfall event appears to be taking shape for later today and tonight,” the National Weather Service office in Shreveport said. “The flooding concerns have ratcheted up significantly over much the region.”

      The Ark-La-Tex region could see widespread rainfall amounts up to 3 inches, but isolated locations could pick up more than 5 inches.  
  

      A Level 2 out of 4 slight risk of flash flooding expands north into Arkansas and includes Little Rock.  
  

      In addition to the flash flooding, there is also a concern for severe storms. A few isolated tornadoes and damaging wind gusts will be a possibility as these storms meander to the north.  
  

      The bulk of the storm activity should be wrapping up along the coast Wednesday evening and continue into Thursday morning for areas to the north.
  

      By Thursday evening, much of the flood potential will be over, with just lingering storms through the end of the week.

44,Millions could face flash flooding as torrential rain targets the South through Wednesday,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/09/weather/flash-flooding-south-houston-tuesday/index.html,"      “Instances of flash flooding are considered likely from the middle and upper Texas Gulf Coast to areas inland across the southeast Texas Triangle, which includes the entire Houston metro region,” the prediction center said.
  

      Several rounds of heavy rain are expected through the day Tuesday and into Wednesday as a stubborn area of low pressure lingers.
  

      The prediction center has issued a Level 3 out of 4 risk for excessive rainfall Tuesday and Wednesday, as torrential rains target the Houston metro area as well as Beaumont, Texas.
  

      More than 7 million people are under flash flood watches in southeastern Texas through Wednesday evening. The region could see rainfall rates as high as 2 to 3 inches per hour at times.
  

      Forecast models are indicating as much as 3 to 7 inches of rain are possible through Wednesday, with some areas potentially getting as much as 10 inches.
  

      “The probability for numerous significant flash floods events has increased,” the National Weather Service in Houston said. “There is an increased danger to lives and property due to flash flooding.”
  

      The main concern will be for areas where storms begin to train, which occurs when storms roll over the same area for longer periods of time, leading to intense flash flooding.
  

Get your local forecast here


      The prediction center also issued a broader area of excessive rainfall risk for much of southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana. This Level 2 risk includes places like Lake Charles, Louisiana, and College Station and Victoria, Texas.  
  

      The Level 2 risk broadens on Wednesday to include areas like Dallas, Shreveport, Louisiana, and Little Rock, Arkansas. These areas will most likely receive around 2 inches of rain, which will be heavy at times.
  

      By the second half of the week, the excessive rainfall risk diminishes, though isolated showers and storms will remain in the forecast.
  

      The threat for flooding will linger due to the already saturated soils.

45,"More than 29,000 people are evacuated from communities throughout Alberta as wildfires rage in Canada",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/08/weather/alberta-canada-wildfires-monday/index.html,"      In the past 24 hours alone, 16 new fires have ignited in Alberta, Wildfire Information Unit Lead Christie Tucker said during a Sunday evening news conference. 
  

      Fighters across the province are still battling 98 wildfires, 27 of which were burning “out of control,” according to Alberta officials.
  

      In a news conference Monday, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith asked residents with firefighting experience who can “lend a helping hand” to contact emergency services.
  

      This type of ferocious wildfire activity isn’t typical this early in the year, and firefighters don’t usually see such a large area burned, Tucker said Sunday morning.
  

      But bone-dry conditions, abnormally hot weather and high winds have converged to fuel this “really extreme wildfire activity,” Tucker said.
  

      “We could be sort of settling in for a long fight here,” she said. 
  

      Wildfires have burned a total of 390,000 hectares in Alberta so far this year, and recent blazes have burned a “huge amount of ground” over the last few days, Tucker said.
  

      Approximately 1,000 firefighters from other regions have been requested to assist in controlling the fires, and they will be arriving over the next week, according to Tucker.
  

Almost 25,000 people in Western Canada evacuated as wildfires rage across region amid hot weather and high winds


      Some gains were made Sunday as scattered showers across the province helped firefighters access areas they couldn’t before due to extreme wildfire behavior. 
  

      “This is giving firefighters a helping hand, causing less active wildfire, allowing them to work on parts of fires they hadn’t been able to access before. It’s a much needed chance to make progress on some of these powerful, challenging wildfires,” Tucker said.
  

      Firefighters now hope that cooler temperatures and higher humidity will help them battle the flames in the south and central part of the province – but challenging conditions remain in the northern part of the province, Tucker said.
  

      “Up north, it’s still very dry. We’re still seeing winds and we are expecting a continuation of those kinds of conditions that can lead to extreme wildfire behavior,” she said in the Sunday evening news conference.
  

      Communities in Alberta have seen some extremely hot temperatures in the past week, with the capital city of Edmonton hitting 31 degrees Celsius, about 88 degrees Fahrenheit, on Wednesday and Thursday – more than 10 degrees above average, according to the Canada Centre for Climate Services.
  

      The region has also seen a lack of precipitation which may have contributed to the extreme fire conditions in Alberta, drying out land and making fires more difficult to contain, CNN Meteorologist Robert Shackelford said.
  

      Tucker said crews faced with “rapidly changing wildfires across the province” will continue to focus their efforts on fires that are threatening communities.
  

      Meanwhile, multiple hospitals have been fully evacuated and many roads are closed in north and central Alberta, according to province officials.
  

      So far, about 5,000 people have sought refuge at evacuation centers, Alberta Emergency Management chief Colin Blair said in the Sunday news conference.
  

      As of Monday, 54 schools have been forced to close, affecting 10,500 students, and contingency plans are being developed, Mike Ellis, the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Services, said in the briefing.
  

      Additionally, 300 patients from long-care facilities have been safely evacuated from various locations across Alberta.
  

      As thousands of Albertans flee their homes and head to evacuation centers, they leave not knowing whether they’ll have a home to return to when the evacuation orders are lifted.
  

      Rick Laboucan, who grew up in the community of Fox Lake, told CNN affiliate CTV that his family home won’t be there when the community returns.
  

      “My whole family’s side over there, our little village side there on the north Fox Lake is all wiped out,” Laboucan said. “Family and friends’ homes are gone.”
  

      An out-of-control wildfire has burned more than 16,300 hectares of land, about 40,200 acres, as of Sunday in the community of Fox Lake, authorities said.
  

      It remains unclear just how much damage the fires have left as the thick smoke and heavy fire conditions keep crews from fully assessing property loss, Blair said.
  

      “We know structures have been lost, but our first priority is protecting lives and dealing with the emergency response first and foremost,” Blair said.
  

      Officials do know that dozens of structures have been damaged, including in the Fox Lake area, where 56 firefighters with heavy equipment and aircraft are battling the flames, authorities said.
  

      Many have also been ordered to flee in Yellowhead County, where immediate evacuations were ordered for 8,000 people. Another 3,600 were ordered to evacuate from Little Red River Cree Nation.
  

      Another out-of-control wildfire dubbed EWF-031 has burned about 77,920 hectares of land, about 192,500 acres, as it rages southeast of the town of Edson in Yellowhead County, according to Alberta fire officials.


      Smith has said it’s an “unprecedented situation our province is facing.”
  

      On Monday, Smith announced that financial assistance would be available to evacuees.
  

      “Every adult who has been evacuated and displaced for seven consecutive days will receive a $1,250 along with an additional $500 for each dependent ending child under age 18,” the premier said.
  

      Smith said the application process will move swiftly so that people can receive evacuation payments as soon as possible. She added that the government is working to ensure that qualifying residents who live in remote locations and indigenous reserves will also receive payments.

46,Severe storms threaten to bring more damage to the Ohio and Mississippi valleys today,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/08/weather/severe-storms-summer-heat-monday-wxn/index.html,"      Spring’s severe weather season is in full bloom across the Midwest and Southern and Central Plains.
  

      Over the weekend, more than 400 severe storm reports were recorded across the region, including hurricane-force wind gusts, hail the size of softballs, and a few tornadoes.
  

      Thousands of people lost power Sunday morning after severe thunderstorms, which spawned two EF-1 tornadoes across southern Indiana, moved through the region. Duke Energy reported 17 poles were broken in Floyd and Clark counties during the storm.
  

      Some of the same areas are at risk of seeing intense severe storms again today.
  

      A Level 2 of 5 risk for severe storms has been issued across portions of the Mississippi and Ohio valleys where the main threats will be damaging winds and large hail. Some cities under threat today include St. Louis; Indianapolis; Cincinnati; Nashville, Tennessee; and Louisville, Kentucky.
  

      Severe storms were already ongoing across this morning, causing more than 10,000 customers to lose power across Illinois, according to PowerOutage.us. More rounds of severe weather are expected later today.
  

      This afternoon, storms will initially bring the threat of large hail the size of golf balls or greater, before transitioning into a damaging wind threat through the evening.
  

      And although the severe storm environment is not favorable for tornado development, “there may still be an opportunity for a tornado or two with any supercell that can be sustained,” the Storm Prediction Center warned.
  

What is a supercell?


      The storms on Monday are following a similar path to storms over the weekend.
  

      An upper-level ridge of high pressure has settled in over the Gulf of Mexico and portions of the southern US. Under the area of high pressure, storms have trouble developing or sustaining severe levels due to sinking air, which inhibits thunderstorm growth. So instead, thunderstorms tend to “ride” or travel along the edges of the ridge, in this case impacting the Midwest and Ohio Valley.
  

      Ridge-riding storms tend to affect the same areas over and over until the high pressure weakens or moves. And unfortunately for some areas where the stubborn pattern has been in place for the last few days, it is not expected to shift until the middle of the week or later.
  

      “Training storms,” as meteorologists call them, bring the threat of flooding as heavy rain falls over already saturated soils.
  

      The Weather Prediction Center has highlighted a large portion of the Midwest and Ohio Valley for flooding Monday, as they expect hourly rainfall totals of two inches per hour, with localized rainfall rates as high as 4 inches possible.
  

      A flash flood watch is currently in effect for the city of Springfield, Illinois, until Tuesday morning due to flooding caused by an upstream dam release after heavy rain fell over the weekend.
  

      Heavy rainfall of 3 to 7 inches fell Sunday across western and southern portions of Sangamon County, across the Lake Springfield watershed, which caused rapid rises on the lake, according to the National Weather Service office in Lincoln, Illinois.
  

      Widespread additional rainfall totals of 1 to 2 inches are forecast across the Midwest and Ohio Valley through Tuesday.
  

      Another byproduct of the high-pressure ridge is heat, building across the southern and central states.
  

      “Temperature-wise, the warmest temperatures compared to normal will be most commonly found in the Nation’s Heartland and across the South,” the Weather Prediction Center said. “It will feel more like June from the southern High Plains to the Southeast coast through Tuesday as daytime high temperatures between 5 to 15 degrees above normal.”
  

      High temperatures in the 90s will be felt across portions of Texas today and widespread 80-degree high temperatures will spread from the central Plains, across the Gulf Coast and into the mid-Atlantic.
  

      By Tuesday, 90-degree temperatures will continue across portions of Texas and expand into Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas.
  

      The heat will ease slightly by Wednesday, but above normal temperatures will persist across much of the eastern US through the end of the week.

47,Inter Milan’s lightning start stuns AC Milan in Champions League semifinal,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/football/ac-milan-inter-champions-league-semifinal-preview-spt-intl/index.html,"      By the time the match had reached the 12th minute, Edin Džeko had volleyed Inter ahead, with Henrikh Mkhitaryan adding a second after bursting into the box and shooting past Mike Maignan.
  

      Inter last won the European Cup in 2010, while AC Milan was Champions League victors in 2007, but any suggestion these two clubs were more associated with yesteryear was quickly forgotten given the electric atmosphere inside the San Siro.
  

      But in the end, it was two of Inter’s veterans who proved to be the difference makers on Wednesday.
  

      With less than 10 minutes on the clock, the experienced Džeko opened the scoring with a cultured volley into the top corner of Maignan’s net. 
  

      It was a finish which showed the 37-year-old’s wealth of know-how as he cleverly guided a volley home from a corner whilst wrestling with AC Milan skipper Davide Calabria.
  

      Inter’s fans didn’t have to wait long before their side doubled the lead when Mkhitaryan finished off another flowing move.
  

      So often the creator of goals, the 34-year-old Armenian kept his cool to strike the ball past Maignan in the AC Milan net.
  

      It could have, and probably should have, got a lot uglier for Stefano Pioli’s side as Inter passed up on several chances to put this semifinal beyond AC Milan.
  

      Hakan Çalhanoğlu’s shot hit the post, while Inter thought they had a penalty in the first half when captain Lautaro Martínez was felled in the box, but referee Jesus Gil Manzano overturned the decision with the help of VAR after concluding the contact had been too minimal. 
  

      Džeko then had a glorious one-on-one opportunity following the half-time interval only to be denied by the Milan ‘keeper. 
  

      It was hard for the home side to perform as badly in the second half as they did in the opening 45 minutes and Pioli’s side did occasionally threaten the Inter goal, notably when Sandro Tonali’s raking shot hit the post.
  

      “It feels very good, especially because it’s a derby and on paper we played away so it’s a great result for us,” Džeko told BT Sport.
  

      “Nothing is yet finished because in the Champions League only great teams arrive in the semifinal, so we have to be careful, we have to be concentrated like today. 
  

      “We have a good result but nothing yet is finished so we will definitely be even more concentrated for the second game.”
  

      AC Milan defender Fikayo Tomori attributed his team’s slow start to some nervousness.
  

      “First half I think there was a bit of anxiety within the team and in a game like this you can’t give them a millimeter, a centimeter. But we can’t dwell on it, we have to move on to the next game,” Tomori told BT Sport.
  

      The second leg of the semifinal between the Milan clubs takes place on May 16 with a place in the Champions League final against either Real Madrid or Manchester City awaiting the victor on June 10.

48,Bob Huggins: West Virginia basketball coach docked $1 million and suspended three games following ‘inexcusable’ homophobic slur,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/sport/bob-huggins-west-virginia-salary-suspension-spt-intl/index.html,"      After his appearance, Huggins apologized and admitted there was no excuse for his hurtful language.
  

      Before his docked pay was announced on Wednesday, Huggins’ annual salary was due to be $4.15 million before incentives, according to a school spokesperson.
  

      Huggins’ suspension includes the Mountaineers’ upcoming first three regular season games.
  

      A graduate of WVU and the school’s head men’s basketball coach for the last 16 years, Huggins also had his multi-year contract amended to a year-to-year deal.
  

      WVU president E. Gordon Gee described the long-time Mountaineers coach’s language as ” inexcusable” and “offensive.”
  

      “We will never truly know the damage that has been done by the words said in those 90 seconds. Words matter and they can leave scars that can never be seen,” Gee said Wednesday. 
  

      “But words can also heal. And by taking this moment to learn more about another’s perspective, speak respectfully and lead with understanding, perhaps the words ‘do better’ will lead to meaningful change for all.”
  

      The school says Huggins and all athletics department will also “partner with WVU’s LGBTQ+ Center to develop annual training sessions that will address all aspects of inequality including homophobia, transphobia, sexism, ableism and more.”
  

      “I deeply regret my actions,” Huggins said Wednesday. “I also regret the embarrassment and disappointment it has caused our Athletics family, members of our campus community and the state of West Virginia.
  

      “I am sorry for the hurt and distress I have caused our students and our student-athletes. I represent more than just our University and our basketball program, and it pains me to know that I have let so many people down.
  

      “I am looking forward to working with WVU’s LGBTQ+ Center and other state organizations to learn more about the issues facing the community,” added Huggins. “As a leader, I am eager to use my platform to take what I learn and share it with a broader audience.”

49,JJ Watt does pub crawl ‘research’ after investing in Premier League-bound Burnley,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/football/jj-watt-burnley-pub-crawl-intl-spt/index.html,"      Watt and his wife – former US Women’s National Team (USWNT) player Kealia – announced their investment in English club Burnley FC last week, after he retired from professional football in the NFL earlier this year.
  

      And this week, the three-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year took a hands-on approach in getting to know the soccer club and its supporters, by embarking on a pub crawl on his way to the stadium. 
  

      “I’ve learned that the history, tradition and supporters, it’s all about respecting and honoring that,” the 34-year-old told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday. 
  

      “You never want to come in and try and do something that’s not true to who the club is, and what we’re trying to do is show people what real Burnley is about.”
  

      Watt added that he had spent some time getting acquainted with the local drinking establishments.
  

      “I did a pub crawl yesterday on my way to the stadium, so I started at the Royal Dyche, worked my way down to Vintage Clarets and all my way up to Turf Moor. Just getting to know the supporters, I want to earn their trust by showing them how much we care and how passionate we are.
  

      “It’s research, I’m doing research – and lots of pints of Guinness along the way. But it was a lot of fun and really good to get to know them on a personal level, and hopefully, they get to know us as well,” he added. 
  

      The Royal Dyche took to Twitter to mark Watt’s visit, sharing an image of him behind the bar on Monday.
  

      “Another visit from NFL legend @JJWatt, what a pleasure it’s been. Lovely gent, such a great reception in the pub from all us Claret fans,” the pub added. 
  

      “What a fantastic addition to the club #UTC.”

50,Tragedy chanting: ‘Vile’ soccer songs about deaths fueled by ‘need to hurt’ opposing fans,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/03/football/tragedy-chanting-in-the-premier-league-spt-intl/index.html,"      In England, the phenomenon is defined as the singing of songs about disasters that have befallen other clubs or their fan bases.
  

      ‘Tragedy chanting’ has marred a number of matches already this season, though they tend to only occur at matches involving one or both of Manchester United and Liverpool, with some opposition fans referencing the Munich air disaster or stadium tragedies of Hillsborough and Heysel.
  

      In February 1958, 23 people – including eight Manchester United players and three members of the club’s staff – died as the team’s plane tried to take off from Munich’s airport.
  

      In May 1985, 39 fans – 32 from Italy, four from Belgium, two from France and one from Northern Ireland – were killed in a stampede ahead of the European Cup final between Juventus and Liverpool at the Heysel Stadium in Brussels.
  

      Then, in 1989, overcrowding in the stands ahead of the FA Cup semifinal between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough Stadium led to the deaths of 97 Liverpool fans. 
  

      Chris Rowland, editor of the website “The Tomkins Times,” which covers Liverpool FC, says “it’s hard to explain” why supporters of clubs that have experienced tragedies in the past would engage in tragedy chanting towards other fanbases. 
  

      “It’s as if they’ve forgotten,” Rowland tells CNN Sport. “It’s almost as though the need to hurt exceeds everything else, as far as I can see.
  

      “The need to hurt the opposing supporters, it seems to me, is the driving influence here. Any club that’s been involved [in a tragedy], nobody from those clubs should ever do it again.”
  

      While most fans are quick to condemn the offensive chanting, the practice shows no sign of going away. 
  

      In February, Leeds and Manchester United released a joint statement following the club’s Premier League fixture after incidents of tragedy chanting from both sets of fans, which targeted both the Munich air disaster and the death of two Leeds fans in 2000 the day before a UEFA Cup semifinal against Galatasaray in Istanbul.
  

      Another case of tragedy chanting by a group of Chelsea fans in a 0-0 draw against Liverpool at Stamford Bridge in early April – which the London club condemned as “hateful” – caused the Premier League to issue a statement saying it would be addressing the issue “as a priority and as a matter of urgency.” 
  

      Additionally, some Manchester City and Nottingham Forest fans have been criticized this season for singing songs about Hillsborough in matches against Liverpool.
  

      However, in the return fixture against Liverpool at Anfield, the traveling Forest supporters were praised for unveiling a banner calling for respect for the victims and the end to tragedy chanting.
  

      In an attempt to eradicate the issue, the Premier League has set up a working group with top-flight clubs to educate supporters about the tragedies in question and the impact such chanting has on fans.
  

      The working group has also been in contact with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to discuss whether convictions can be pursued for fans that engage in tragedy chanting.
  

      Geoff Pearson, a professor at Manchester University who has specialized in football crowd disorder, says self-policing within a fan base is “absolutely the key” to eradicating the practice, especially as some of the chants “aren’t by their content unlawful.”
  

      This makes asking the police to get involved “quite challenging,” he explains.
  

      “The most powerful thing is when the fan in front of you just turns around and says: ‘Shut up, we don’t do that at this club,’ because that is a powerful message,” Pearson told CNN Sport. 
  

      “It’s humiliating for the fan that’s done that and I think this explains for a large part why we have almost eradicated overt racist chanting in English football stadiums. 
  

      “You go away with England [the national team] and you go into certain bars, and you will hear racist chanting, but you don’t hear it in the stadium because that’s where it has become unacceptable. 
  

      “But a combination of messaging and, occasionally – if you have a really entrenched problem – banning some individuals or taking criminal action if you can against some individuals has also made an impact.”
  

      CNN has reached out to the UK government’s Football Policing Unit, but has yet to receive a response.
  

      Neil Atkinson, a writer for Liverpool FC website “The Anfield Wrap,” echoes those sentiments, telling CNN the first thing fans should do if a fellow supporter begins engaging in tragedy chanting is to “drown it out” with other songs.
  

      “If it isn’t the majority of supporters, it shouldn’t be the majority of the noise and there is an immediate practical step [people can take],” he says.
  

      “The next thing is education through action by the clubs. Leeds United have been looking to do that,” Atkinson adds, referring to the anti-chanting campaign launched by the Yorkshire club last year.
  

      “Arsenal and Fulham have both visited the [Hillsborough] memorial. I still think a wider societal understanding of what happened in 1989 and the smears that have followed would be no bad thing in general.”
  

      Last month, Arsenal and Fulham’s team managers and captains laid wreaths at the Hillsborough memorial to mark the 34th anniversary of the disaster.

      In the immediate aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster and in the years that followed, the Sun newspaper and local South Yorkshire police launched a campaign of misinformation that tried to place the blame on Liverpool supporters, according to an independent inquest.


      Ahead of Manchester United’s visit to Anfield last month, managers Jurgen Klopp and Erik ten Hag released a joint statement urging supporters of both clubs to stop chants in stadiums and online abuse relating to the tragedies.
  

      “It is unacceptable to use the loss of life — in relation to any tragedy — to score points, and it is time for it to stop,” United boss ten Hag said. 
  

      “Those responsible tarnish not only the reputation of our clubs but also, importantly, the reputation of themselves, the fans, and our great cities.”
  

      Liverpool’s Klopp added that chants about tragedies “have no place in football.”
  

      “If we can keep the passion and lose the poison it will be so much better for everyone,” he said.
  

      While this is by no means a new issue – Pearson notes some of the earliest Munich chants happened during the 1957/58 season – it has undoubtedly become more prevalent this season.
  

      Charlotte Hennessey, whose father James was one of the 97 fans who died at Hillsborough, created a petition calling for tragedy chanting to be made a criminal offense, which has received more than 17,000 signatures. 
  

      Speaking to the Mirror earlier this month, she described what it feels like to hear opposition fans singing about the tragedy.
  

      “All I wanted to do was watch the football in my own home with my children,” she said of Liverpool’s match at City. “Then I hear the hate chanting.
  

      “The chanting starts, and I can’t even watch the match,” said Charlotte, 40. “I have to explain to my children why people are so cruel, and how the lies go all the way back to 1989.”
  

      For those affected by the tragedies, hearing those chants “hurts us all,” Rowland says, “certainly those of us who were there.
  

      “You only have to imagine how that hurts those who lost relatives and friends.”

51,‘You’re not alone’: CNN Heroes share advice for Mental Health Awareness Month,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/health/mental-health-awareness-month-gun-violence-loneliness-treatment-cnnheroes/index.html,"      May is Mental Health Awareness Month, and this year it seems to coincide with a flurry of violent headlines. For many, this constant bad news adds to the stress of everyday life, which may already feel overwhelming.
  

      According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, each year in the US, one in five adults experience mental illness and one in six children aged 6 to 17 experience a mental health disorder. That’s millions of people. In 2021, less than half of adults received treatment. 
  

      America’s mental health crisis is having a widespread impact that touches everyone.
  

      “One of the things that we underestimate as a society is how our global mental health impacts us as individuals. And we have seen it over and over again as we experience gun violence,” said Michele Neff Hernandez, a 2021 CNN Hero who has helped millions navigate grief and loss through her nonprofit Soaring Spirits. “We can see what happens when people don’t get the help they need; there can be tragic consequences.”
  

      Neff Hernandez is one of many CNN Heroes who have found unique ways to help people with their mental health. Some of them marked Mental Health Awareness Month by sharing advice and insight with CNN’s Elizabeth Belanger about what is working for their communities. Below are edited versions of their conversations.
  

      For Neff Hernandez, whose organization helps widowed people connect with each other in a community of support, it’s important for everyone to know they aren’t alone in their struggle. Mental illness is common, yet the stigma surrounding it is often a hurdle for people seeking the treatment they need.
  

Michele Neff Hernandez: When our body isn’t working well, going to a doctor to seek the cause or to help alleviate symptoms is considered normal and even responsible. Yet, when we are struggling with our mental health for any reason – including grieving a death, experiencing a traumatic event, even coping with the global and national crises that are a part of our daily narrative – we so often hesitate to seek mental health support. The pervasive stigmatizing narrative that implies that seeking mental health support shows weakness or that a mental illness or the breakdown of our mental health for any reason is something to be ashamed of has a significantly negative impact on our society, especially our young people. 
  

      We have to model good mental health care by learning about mental health with the same vigor we use to learn about physical health. Imagine if meditation were as popular as weight loss. Or if picking up your mood stabilizing medication was viewed in the same way as picking up your blood pressure medication. Normalizing caring for and seeking help with mental health is a gift we can give ourselves and the next generation. We all need mental health support at many times in our lives; what a gift it would be if accessing that help were viewed as just part of normal life.
  

      We see this in grief all the time: No one wants to allow people to be sad. We seek to fix instead of listen. We pressure grieving people to “get over it” to make others more comfortable. We set the definition of success after a traumatic event as “returning to normal,” even when returning to a past normal is impossible. The truth is we are always changed by the challenges we overcome, and integrating what we’ve learned about ourselves in the aftermath is one of the key elements of building resilience. When we stigmatize mental health care, we create an environment that ensures that the people who most need help will suffer alone.
  

Annette March-Grier is a 2014 CNN Hero and the founder of Roberta’s House, a bereavement center in Baltimore, Maryland. Their programs reach more than 4,000 people of all ages each year. In 2021, the organization moved into a new state-of-the-art center where it hosts in-person support groups and serves people who are suffering all types of loss.
  

      March-Grier stresses the importance of putting yourself first to enhance mental well-being.
  

Annette March-Grier: Everyone is looking for some kind of balance, yet few are finding it. Your state of mind is where it all begins. Make self-care a priority for your mental wellness. “Self-care is not selfish.” It is a truth that if you don’t take care of yourself, you will have nothing to give others. This includes healthy relationships that can be jeopardized because of stress, burnout, and lack of self-care. Your physical health is also connected to your mental health. Negative thoughts and suppression of these can cause dis-ease, and over time this leads to disease.
  

      Self-care means taking time out for self, creating a gratitude list, journaling, dancing, laughing, breathing fully, smelling the fresh air, being aware of surroundings, being in the moment, enjoying the stillness when you can, taking time out for self, playing with your pet, exercising, reflecting on the past, dreaming about the future, eating healthy, helping someone in need. All of these self-care activities increase the body’s endorphins and bring on relaxation and balance.
  

      Sports helped 2012 CNN Hero Scott Strode overcome his addiction to drugs and alcohol. He founded The Phoenix in 2007 to provide free athletic activities and a sober support community to others battling addiction. Today, the organization is in more than 200 communities nationwide with nearly 200,000 members.
  

      Strode’s work focuses on the intersection of exercise and personal connection to benefit mental health. 
  

Scott Strode: Social connection is a powerful tool for creating positive mental health. At The Phoenix, every day we see the profound impact that belonging and social connection has on our members’ confidence and overall well-being. Just spending a few minutes daily in the presence of others can be inherently powerful, and thankfully it is now easier than ever to make these vital connections. 
  

      Whether it’s getting together for an activity or just talking about challenges being faced, social connectivity can help us all overcome mental health challenges.
  

      Exercise can also be a powerful tool to improve mental health. We encourage you to get out for a 15- to 30-minute walk or run and consider inviting a friend to join you. Sharing these physical activities with supportive peers can create the vulnerability to begin to share about what else you might be experiencing.
  

      Service dogs are often a helpful tool for members of the military returning from deployment and afflicted by conditions like PTSD, depression, and anxiety. 2012 CNN Hero Mary Cortani’s nonprofit, Operation Freedom Paws, has helped nearly 600 veterans, first responders, and others train their own service dogs. 
  

      Cortani emphasizes that not all wounds are visible, and silence is not a treatment for mental illness.
  

Mary Cortani: If the world has taught me anything, it has taught me to remember to be kind, do not judge what you cannot see. Pain is invisible. With all the craziness going on every day, breathe. It is okay to feel down, to feel overloaded, overwhelmed, sad, frustrated. Try not to hold onto it. Seek help, talk to your family, friends, pastor, priest – talk to someone. And for those listening, really hear, pay attention, because sometimes the silence says more than the words. There is no shame to ask for help. It takes courage, and we all have it within us. 
  

Impact Your World: Here's how you can get mental health help


      It takes all of us to realize mental health needs to be talked about, not buried under the rug. We need open, honest conversations; we have a mental health crisis in this country that is only getting worse as we become more divided. Fear only adds to it. Mental health doesn’t just affect veterans and first responders; it can affect everyone. Trauma is trauma, and enough repeated exposure changes the brain. There is hope, and there can be healing, but we all need to work together to help those who need our help. 
  

      We need to stop the silence surrounding mental health and model healthy behaviors so that we can assist with support and help guide towards resources. We are not in this alone, nor are those suffering from mental health issues.

52,These Ukrainian veterinarians are risking their lives to care for dogs and cats in the war zone,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/28/world/ukraine-war-dog-cat-rescue-veterinarians-cnnheroes/index.html,"      It wasn’t long before Ukrainian veterinarians Valentina and Leonid Stoyanov learned that many pets were locked in nearby homes. 
  

      “After one, two weeks … neighbors just start hear (sic) how a lot of different animals around them screaming,” Valentina told CNN. 
  

      At the time, the couple specialized in exotic animal and wildlife rescue. With the invasion came a new mission: caring for these beloved but abandoned pets.
  

      The Stoyanovs began working with local police to access homes to rescue dogs and cats. Within a week of the invasion, Leonid said they were caring for some 400 animals in their Odesa clinic. 
  

      “Each animal for us, it’s like members of our family,” Valentina said.
  

      For the last decade, the couple has worked together treating more unusual animals and wildlife. Before the war, their videos of the monkeys, snakes, owls, and other creatures they rescued and cared for found a growing audience on their “Vet Crew” TikTok and Instagram feeds.
  

      Valentina said their “simple life” has changed drastically.
  

      “All our family – mother, father – have to leave Ukraine,” Leonid said. “But we decided we stay here and help animals – a lot of animals.”
  

      Their clinic is partially underground and surrounded by taller buildings offering some protection from Russian attacks. But the lack of electricity is one of their most serious challenges. The couple needed to find a generator to keep the lights on and their reptiles warm.
  

      The Stoyanovs purchased tons of dog and cat food that they distribute to area shelters. They have also often driven to the front lines to help animals in need. Leonid recalls wearing body armor on his many trips vaccinating and feeding dogs there.
  

      “Russian army a lot of times shooting our car and they bombed it. And one time they missed (by) maybe ten meters. And we have a lot of holes in our car,” he said.
  

      During the last year, Leonid’s health also took a turn for the worse. He suffered a heart attack and said he was clinically dead for several minutes before doctors were able to revive him. 
  

      “They say, “You have a lot of animals. You need to (be) here,” he said. 
  

      He has since had two surgeries, including one to implant a pacemaker. And despite some discomfort, he says he feels “physically normal” now.
  

      The Stoyanovs usually try to find new homes for the animals they rescue, or they release wild animals back into their natural habitat. But it was a different story for a blind husky named Casper, now a permanent member of the Stoyanov family. He belonged to a Ukrainian soldier named Sergei who had no family and asked the couple to care for his dog while he was away fighting. 
  

      “It was very touching moment when Casper and … Sergei say goodbye (to) each other. Because Sergei crying and Casper also crying,” Valentina said. 
  

      Sergei would call every week, but after about two months, Casper began acting strangely and cried. The Stoyanovs later learned that this was around the time when Sergei was killed, Leonid said. 
  

      “It’s very, very depressive situation (here),” Leonid said. “We cannot sleep because we are nervous. … We have a lot of work, a lot of animals, a lot of people dying, a lot of our friends dying.” 
  

      Despite all of the challenges, the couple say they have no plans to stop.
  

      “We just hold on and continue to do what we do because we see how it is important for animals, for all these lives around us,” Valentina said.
  

      The Stoyanovs are grateful for the support they receive online from their social media community, whom they call their Vet Crew Family. They said it’s their encouragement that keeps them going.

53,This CNN Hero is recruiting recreational divers to help rebuild reefs in Florida one coral at a time,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/21/us/florida-coral-reef-ecosystem-restoration-diving-cnnheroes/index.html,"      “I was just chasing money,” he said. “But I realized that is not me. … It just wasn’t true to my core.” 
  

      In 1996, Goldberg left his job and his home in Los Angeles to follow his passion for underwater diving, spending time in Hawaii, the British Virgin Islands, and the Cayman Islands. 
  

      “When I got out of the water after my very first dive, I decided that this is what I really wanted to do … to take my life and somehow intertwine diving and making a living,” he said. 
  

      In 2004, Goldberg and his family settled in Islamorada, in the Florida Keys, and opened a dive shop, Key Dives.
  

      Today, he’s on a mission to help bring the area’s coral reefs back to life through his nonprofit, I.CARE. 
  

      As an avid diver, Goldberg developed a strong appreciation for the coral reefs and their essential role in the marine ecosystem. They not only support all kinds of species, but they protect coastal areas, and millions of people depend on them for food and jobs. 
  

      Over the last two decades, he saw coral reefs in the Florida Keys go from colorful and full of life to functionally extinct today. What he used to see were “brain coral the size of a VW Beetle, and fields of staghorn and elkhorn coral that went on forever,” he said. 
  

      Now, he says many of the reefs in the area cannot recover naturally on their own and require human intervention to survive. Goldberg knew he needed to do something to help and wanted to find a way to get other people involved.
  

      “I know more about the history of and what’s happening now to the reef than most people,” he said. “I’m not a scientist, but that puts me in a unique position to communicate in layman’s terms about what’s going on.” 
  

      He realized that recreational divers could be a great workforce to help turn around the damage and restore the reefs. He also envisioned that other local dive shops, residents, and tourists could play a role. 
  

      Around the same time, he met Dr. Kylie Smith, who was completing her PhD to become a behavioral ecologist and a coral reef ecologist. They spent hours at Goldberg’s dive shop discussing the health of the reef. 
  

      In 2019, they teamed up to co-found I.CARE, which stands for Islamorada Conservation and Restoration Education, with the goal of empowering divers to help restore the area’s reefs, ensuring their survival for future generations.
  

      I.CARE organizes and offers special coral restoration dives for local and out-of-town participants. They spend the day learning about the importance of coral reefs and how to help rebuild them, then they go on dives to transplant coral grown in a local nursery run by Mote Marine Laboratory and Aquarium. 
  

      So far, Goldberg says the organization has transplanted more than 10,000 corals and educated more than 2,000 people. The I.CARE team monitors and maintains all of the transplanted coral, making sure it’s thriving.
  

      “There’s so much work to do. We’re just getting started,” Goldberg said.
  

      CNN’s Laura Klairmont spoke with Goldberg about his efforts. Below is an edited version of their conversation.
  

CNN: What has caused the degradation of the coral reefs in the Florida Keys? 
  

Mike Goldberg: The Keys in general – the ocean, the coral reef, the marine life – used to be the best anywhere. When I moved here 20 years ago, (there were) massive elkhorn corals that I used to swim around that were 12 feet across in both directions. Fields of them and stalks like trees that you could swim underneath on your back and marvel looking up at. Back then, we could swim a quarter mile in one direction and see nothing more than a quarter inch between the live coral. The live coral would compete for that underwater territory. Today, I could swim 20 feet in one direction and not see any. We’ve lost so much coral. It’s hard to express it. It truly is a pretty devastating number. 
  

      The coral reefs are threatened by ocean acidification, temperature, runoff. And then in 2014, there was something we called stony coral tissue loss disease. (It) was the sledgehammer that changed everything. It is incredibly virulent, and it started up near Miami and worked its way down. In 2016, it presented itself here, and we lost more coral in that one year than we did in all my prior years combined in diving. It was so dramatic watching this coral head die all in front of us. And we didn’t know what to do, how to stop it. It was very hard to watch, and feel helpless, wishing you could do something to stop it.
  

CNN: Why are coral reefs so important to the health of the ocean? 
  

Goldberg: Without them, nothing is here simply put. They are what brings the ecosystem together. The majority of what we see out there at one point in their life is spending time on a coral reef. There’s small fish, not bigger than a grain of rice, all the way up to your large predatory fish, tiger sharks. The entire ecosystem’s right there out on the reef at any given point. Whether it’s a neon goby, whether it’s a cleaner shrimp, whether it’s a juvenile Spanish hogfish. Without that live coral as their home, that disappears. And when they’re gone, we have fewer snappers, grouper. It’s just a cascade effect because that goes all the way up the food chain. So, it’s imperative that we have a healthy coral reef for us to have a full ecosystem. Without a coral reef, there’s so many problems that will ensue.
  

CNN: What is unique about your approach to the work? 
  

Goldberg: I knew the only way that I could make it work is through the power of the recreational dive community. What I believed would work, and is, (is they’re) coming down and helping us rebuild the reef. There are a lot of them. And I truly believe at their core the vast majority want to be a part of this. And my experience so far has been just that. They want to keep doing it. They love being part of it.
  

      What I can do is tell the world of divers that are out there, “Let’s band together. This is a plight not only for the Keys, but the Caribbean, for the Pacific, for the Red Sea. It’s all around the world. And if we, as a community of divers, don’t attempt to bring back or at least get it to a self-sustaining level, the dive community will disappear.”
  

      This avenue gives those individuals another reason to come diving. They can be talking to their friends, to their families, getting them excited and spreading out those tendrils so we get more and more people down here helping us rebuild the reef. 
  

      I truly believe we’re going to be successful with this restoration work. I see things every time I go in the water that give me hope that we will have a sustaining coral reef.

54,This CNN Hero offers judgment-free veterinary care for the pets of those experiencing homelessness,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/14/us/california-street-veterinary-medicine-pets-cnnheroes/index.html,"      “It was my way to heal,” said Stewart, a veterinarian whose nonprofit, Project Street Vet, provides medical care to the pets of people experiencing homelessness. “Maybe some of it was guilt. Maybe some of it was I just wanted my own little crusade.”
  

      Stewart had spent several years working in a county shelter in Northern California when he thought about quitting in 2011. He’d long dreamed of saving animals but was instead forced to euthanize an increasing number of those that were being surrendered.
  

      “It was the recession. I’m seeing hordes of unwanted pets dropped off, people who don’t have the money to feed them or care for them medically,” Stewart, 53, said. “It started to steal a part of my soul. I thought about leaving the veterinary profession altogether.”
  

      Stewart was at a crossroads, he said, desperately trying to lower the shelter’s rates of euthanasia and increase adoption rates, but also struggling with the sheer number of animals dropped off there. On a whim one morning, he stopped to examine the dog of a homeless man outside a 7-11 where he got his coffee. 
  

      “I’d seen this guy before and ignored him. Regrettably, just walked by him,” Stewart said. “And on this day, I just broke pattern because I noticed his dog had some sort of serious skin condition.”
  

      Stewart diagnosed and treated the dog’s condition, and the animal was transformed. But for Stewart, the man’s gratitude was the real wakeup call: “Thank you for not ignoring me” were the words that Stewart says inspired his next chapter. 
  

      “That was the moment I said to myself, ‘I’m going to do more of this. I’m going to get back to saving animals on my terms. And I’m going to do it for passion, not for pay.’”
  

      Soon after, Stewart began to do more outreach, setting up small drop-in clinics to provide medical care to pets whose owners couldn’t afford it and walking the streets looking for unhoused individuals whose pets needed help. Right away he was struck by how much the pet owners cared for their beloved animals. 
  

      “They’re with each other 24/7 hours a day. Their bond and relationship is on a different level,” Stewart said. “Because they’re not in a traditional home, it doesn’t necessarily make them less of a pet parent. A pet doesn’t care about nice furniture and a big home, they want to spend it with you.”
  

      And he found that many pet owners wanted to share their stories about their dog and their history together.
  

      With their consent, Stewart’s brother, Ian, eventually began documenting some of the work and personal stories to raise awareness about animal welfare and homelessness. 
  

      “They probably get criticized more than anything, especially from people in the outside world. But I’ve seen people give up their last meal for their pet and people who have $3 to their name, and after I’m done with the treatment, they will try and give me that $3,” Stewart said. 
  

      His brother encouraged him to spread the word and join forces with others to provide street care, and soon more like-minded animal welfare professionals jumped on board. 
  

      Genesis Rendon, a registered veterinary nurse who Stewart calls his “right-hand,” had worked in the veterinary field for nearly two decades and was doing her own street outreach when she teamed up with him in 2016. Today, as a lead volunteer for Project Street Vet, she is often by Stewart’s side in homeless camps and on Los Angeles’ Skid Row assisting animals in need. 
  

      “Now it’s spreading across the country,” Stewart said. “I’m building a network of trusted volunteers, technicians with hospitals and clinics we can call on. These are all people who just reached out and said, ‘I’m inspired by what you do. How do I do it?’”
  

      Stewart says they can treat about 80% of the cases they see out of a small portable kit. Treatments include antibiotics, vaccines, and anti-inflammatories as well as deworming and flea and tick medications. 
  

      “It’s boots on the ground,” Stewart said, adding that their group will also help connect animals in need to clinic services. “And whenever we can, we advocate for or assist people in getting their animals spayed and neutered.” 
  

      Stewart’s work with Project Street Vet is all volunteer, and the organization has expanded to other cities, including Orlando and Atlanta.
  

      “It doesn’t matter what your situation is or what your background or past is, I see a pet in need, and I see a person who cares for them dearly who just needs some help. … It’s at no cost to them. It’s free.”
  

      Since he started, Stewart and his volunteer teams have treated thousands of animals while giving their human parents hope and dignity, too. 
  

       “I will say this about the people I’ve met who have pets on the streets,” he said. “They are some of the most remarkable pet parents I’ve ever met.”

0,Ford reveals redesigned Ranger pickup with new Raptor performance model - CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/10/ford-reveals-redesigned-ranger-truck-with-new-raptor-performance-model.html,"In this article F Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT

2024 Ford Ranger Raptor Ford

DETROIT — Ford Motor on Wednesday revealed its redesigned Ranger midsize pickup truck for the U.S., including a new Raptor performance model. The addition of the Raptor — starting at $56,960 — is part of Ford's plan to increase high-profit variants to boost its bottom line, as the company pours billions into electric vehicles. Ford CEO Jim Farley last month told investors that special variants such as the Raptor share roughly 80% of their parts with regular models but have 30% higher contribution margins, with a ""twofold increase in capital efficiency."" Ford expects the Raptor to represent around 10% of Ranger's sales in the U.S., according to Gretchen Sauer, Ford's marketing manager of the pickup. ""The Raptor's going to be at the top end of our Ranger offering,"" Sauer said. ""It's going to extend up our overall transaction price for Ranger.""

2024 Ford Ranger Raptor Ford

Ford declined to release the current average transaction price of the Ranger. Auto research firm Edmunds reports it was roughly $41,300 as of last month. The Ranger Raptor, which is powered by a 3.0-liter EcoBoost V6 engine, adds to Ford's Raptor lineup that currently includes the F-150 full-size pickup and Bronco SUV. Ford also is raising the starting prices of its standard Ranger models, which include additional tech and safety features. The price of the entry-level XL model will start at $34,160, up roughly 18% from $27,400 for the current model. The Ranger Raptor raises the top-end starting price for the vehicle by 34%. Pricing includes mandatory destination fees. Ordering for the 2024 Ranger opens this month, with vehicles scheduled to arrive at dealerships beginning in late summer.

Global pickup

While the Ranger's U.S. sales pale in comparison to Ford's larger F-Series trucks, the smaller pickup is critical to the Detroit automaker's global sales. Ford produces the vehicle in five different plants globally to be sold in more than 180 markets. The Ford brand sold more than 1 million pickups globally in 2022, and the automaker said Ranger sales more than doubled from a decade ago to more than 300,000 units last year. The Ranger is second in global sales to the Toyota Hilux, according to industry data.

2024 Ford Ranger Raptor Ford

""The mission has always been to climb the mountain to No. 1,"" Jim Baumbick, vice president of Ford product development and quality, told CNBC. ""We're a clear global No. 2 and we have our sights fully set for the top of the podium."" Ranger's U.S. sales were down about 40% last year, as the automaker battled supply chain problems and prioritized production of the Ford Bronco SUV, which saw sales more than triple in 2022 to top 117,000 units.

Ranger vs. Bronco

The Ranger and the Bronco are both produced at a Michigan plant, which creates a sort of push-pull in their respective production. ""Ford is going to be trying to decide at any given moment which is the vehicle to produce, but they can flex back and forth,"" said Stephanie Brinley, principal automotive analyst at S&P Global Mobility. Baumbick says balancing production of the Ranger and Bronco at Ford's Michigan Assembly Plant is something he's spending a tremendous amount of time working on. ""It's a challenge. It's a good problem to have. We have incredible demand on both the Bronco and the Ranger side,"" he said. ""As we launch the new Ranger, we're going to be constantly balancing between the two.""

2024 Ford Ranger XLT Sport Ford

The Ranger fits in between Ford's compact Maverick pickup and the automaker's full-size F-150 and larger F-Series trucks. This is the first time the Ranger has been redesigned since Ford released the well-received Maverick pickup in 2021. To assist in differentiating the pickups, Ford added more capability and power to the Ranger. It's also 2 inches wider and longer than the current generation truck. The 2024 Ranger will come standard with 2.3-liter turbocharged engine with 270 horsepower and 310 foot-pounds of torque. A 2.7-liter V6 twin-turbo engine that's currently offered in the F-150 and Bronco SUV also will be available. That engine produces 315 horsepower and 400 foot-pounds of torque. The Ranger Raptor will come standard with a 3.0-liter EcoBoost V6 engine that's expected to produce best-in-class 405 horsepower and 430 foot-pounds of torque.",business,1
1,Trying to get a loan? How the 2023 banking crisis has made borrowing even tougher. - USA TODAY,https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/economy/2023/05/08/svb-collapse-banking-crisis-stricter-loans/70195536007/,"Banks made obtaining a loan tougher for consumers and businesses in recent months amid the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and two other institutions, heralding a dimmer outlook for the U.S. economy, according to a Federal Reserve survey.

Forty-two percent of banks said they somewhat tightened lending standards for large and midsize companies over the past three months, according to the Fed’s Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey. And 45% said they somewhat toughened lending criteria for small firms.

A similar percentage of banks already was making borrowing more challenging for consumers and businesses in the prior three-month period because of an increasingly uncertain economy and the Fed’s aggressive interest rate hikes.

While banks repeated their concerns about the economy and a reduced tolerance for risk in the latest survey, more small and midsize banks cited worries about customers’ withdrawal of deposits, liquidity concerns and funding costs.

Banks also toughened lending standards for consumer, auto and credit card loans, according to the survey. Credit card balances have reached a record level and delinquency rates have edged higher as low- and middle-income households grapple with high inflation.

The banks also said they expected to further toughen lending criteria the rest of the year for all types of loans.

Demand for loans by households and businesses also has waned, the survey said. Customers’ appetite for borrowing to finance home and auto purchases has decreased as the Fed has sharply lifted interest rates over the past 14 months, jacking up borrowing costs.

In March, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed as many customers withdrew deposits because of worries about the banks’ survival amid substantial investment losses. The value of their Treasury bond holdings had plunged as the Fed sharply lifted interest rates over the past 14 months.

The Fed, Treasury Department and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. eased the panic by announcing they would ensure depositors could obtain their money even if their accounts exceeded the FDIC’s $250,000 insurance limit.

But concerns rippled to other regional banks and last week First Republic Bank became the third bank to fail.

Last week, the Fed hiked its key interest rate by a quarter percentage point to a range of 5% to 5.25%, capping its biggest flurry of rate increases in 40 years to tame a historic inflation surge. But the Fed indicated it now could pause, noting the banking crisis likely would dampen economic growth and inflation, leaving the Fed less work to do.

2,April inflation report likely to show prices are moderating at 'snail's pace' - Fox Business,https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/april-inflation-report-show-prices-moderating-snails-pace,"A high-stakes inflation report due Wednesday is expected to show that price pressures within the economy remained strong last month despite an aggressive interest rate hike campaign by the Federal Reserve.

Economists expect the consumer price index, which measures a basket of goods, including gasoline, health care, groceries and rent, to show that monthly prices rose 0.4% in April, up from the increase of 0.1% recorded the previous month. On an annual basis, inflation is projected to have climbed 5%, unchanged from March but down from a peak of 9.1% in June.

That remains nearly three times higher than the pre-pandemic average, the latest evidence that inflation is ""moderating at a snail's pace,"" Bank of America economist Michael Gapen said.

Other parts of the report are also expected to point to a slow retreat for inflation, a worrisome sign for the U.S. central bank. Core prices, which exclude the more volatile measurements of food and energy, are expected to climb 0.4% or 5.5% annually, suggesting that underlying price pressures remain strong.

HOW THE BANKING CRISIS COULD HAMMER SMALL BUSINESSES

""As we have been saying for some time now, we expect that slowing economic activity will trigger a material deceleration in inflation, but the path back to 2% will be long and bumpy,"" Wells Fargo analysts wrote in a note Friday.

Consumers were likely squeezed last month in the form of higher food and gasoline prices. Analysts expect that groceries posted another cost increase as major companies like PepsiCo, Nestle and Unilever announced price hikes in their most recent quarterly earnings calls.

DEBT CEILING DEADLINE IS CLOSER THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED - HERE'S WHY

On top of that, gas prices spiked in early April after OPEC+ unexpectedly slashed oil production; AAA data indicates daily gas prices rose by 5.2% in April from the previous year.

""Unfortunately, it has been like watching the financial equivalent of a car wreck,"" said Mark Hamrick, an economic analyst at Bankrate. ""Between the spikes in gasoline, food and shelter prices, there has been no shortage of sources of aggravation associated with inflation for many months now. This tension is easing but hasn’t gone away.""

The Federal Reserve is closely watching the report for evidence inflation is finally subsiding as policymakers try to cool the economy with a series of aggressive interest rate hikes. Officials approved the 10th straight rate increase last week, lifting the benchmark federal funds rate to a range of 5% to 5.25%, the highest since 2007.

FED RAISES INTEREST RATES A QUARTER POINT, HINTS AT POSSIBLE PAUSE

But central bankers also opened the door to a long-awaited pause in the tightening cycle, although they stressed that it hinged on upcoming economic data.

The Fed is also taking into consideration other economic indicators, including job growth and consumer inflation expectations. In a potentially worrisome sign for the central bank, both hiring and wage growth came in stronger-than-expected last month.

3,Sweden’s Sobi to Buy CTI Biopharma for $1.7 Billion - Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sweden-sobi-buy-cti-biopharma-052115154.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB agreed to buy US biotech CTI BioPharma Corp., which develops therapies for blood-related cancers, in a deal valued at $1.7 billion.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Sobi shares plunged as much as 17% in early trading after the company said it would acquire all of CTI’s outstanding stock for $9.10 per share, almost double CTI’s last closing price, and issue new shares to fund as much as half of the transaction.

The deal “fits well” with Sobi’s focus on hematology, analysts said, and delivers a medicine that’s already cleared for sale in the lucrative US market, called Vonjo. But “the equity component of the transaction may initially be perceived negatively” because the new share issuance will dilute the stock, RBC Capital Markets analyst Alistair Campbell said in a note to clients.

The takeover will initially be funded with debt financing from Bank of America Corp. and Danske Bank A/S. After the deal closes, up to half of the purchase consideration will be refinanced through an issuance of new ordinary shares, Sobi said.

The transaction price represents a multiple of about 1.9 times peak sales, compared with as much as 3 times for recent deals, “which makes the valuation look reasonable,” Handelsbanken analyst Mattias Haggblom said in a note.

CTI was expected to become profitable next year and “there are certainly going to be synergies for Sobi to extract to accelerate that profitability,” he wrote.

Sobi’s main shareholder Investor AB — controlled by the Wallenberg family — agreed to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the rights issue, corresponding to about 34.7% of the shares to be issued.

The CEO said users can now reply to any message in a DM thread, not just the most recent, as well as use any emoji to react to a message. Previously, users would only be able to reply to the latest message in a DM thread and only react with specific emojis.

Musk also announced that encrypted DMs ""should"" be released on Wednesday.

Encryption in messages means that only the sender and receiver are able to see a message. In theory, Twitter and Musk would not be able to see or intercept direct messages between people.

""The acid test is that I could not see your DMs even if there was a gun to my head,"" Musk tweeted.

Summary Companies Expects full-year operating profit to climb to $22.2 bln

Targets 10.1 mln vehicle production in new FY, up 11% Y/Y

Q4 profit jumps 35%, beats forecasts; record annual revenue

Shares close up 0.8% after rising as much as 2.5%















TOKYO, May 10 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) on Wednesday said it expects operating profit to climb 10% this business year, with a five-fold jump in pure electric vehicle (EV) sales amid an easing in global supply chain disruption from a shortage of chips.

The growth plan was unveiled by new CEO Koji Sato, installed last month, and signals a more aggressive push towards electrification by the Japanese firm that has previously pursued a go-slow approach to all-electric cars, arguing its strategy would provide more consumer choice.

The world's biggest car maker by sales forecast battery EV sales, including those of its luxury Lexus brand, would reach 202,000 worldwide this business year through March 2024 - up more than fivefold from 38,000 units last year.

Toyota forecast operating profit would rise to 3.0 trillion yen ($22.2 billion) this business year, in line with an analysts' average forecast of 3.02 trillion yen.

That target came after operating profit for the fiscal fourth quarter through March surged more than a third to 626.9 billion yen - easily ahead of the average 553.46 billion yen profit estimated by 10 analysts, according to Refinitiv data.

Toyota's strategy has seen it come under pressure in China, the world's biggest auto market, where nimble local brands such as BYD Co Ltd (002594.SZ) have moved aggressively with battery EVs, weakening dominance of established foreign brands.

But Sato said the demand for purely battery-powered vehicles in China largely represented a new need in the market and was separate from demand for hybrid vehicles.

""We would like to work on both sides,"" he said.

The profit target has been helped by a weak yen boosting the value of overseas sales, and higher output volumes that outweighed the impact of surging materials costs. Reflecting the impact of the weak yen, revenue for the business year that ended in March this year grew to a record 37.15 trillion yen.

Toyota shares, which were nearly flat before the release of the earnings, surged immediately on their publication and rose as much as 2.5% before paring gains to close up 0.8%.

EV ACCELERATION

The new EV sales target, still a fraction of industry leader Tesla (TSLA.O), would boost Toyota's battery EVs to nearly 2% of total sales volume, up from just 0.4% of its total vehicle sales in the last fiscal year.

""We expect an increase in (overall) sales volume in all regions and production volume of 10.1 million (vehicles), due to such factors as ... improvement in semiconductor supply,"" Toyota said in a statement. That would represent output growth of 11% versus the previous year.

Seeking to raise its game in the EV sector, where it has been outstripped by new Chinese automakers as well as Tesla, Toyota has said it will introduce 10 new battery-powered vehicles, targeting sales of 1.5 million EVs a year by 2026.

Toyota will speed up its push to provide ""appropriate"" solutions for different regions, said Sato, adding that new models would range from compact commercial to luxury vehicles and be centred mainly on the United States and China.

A previously announced dedicated unit to focus on next-generation battery EVs, known as BEV Factory, would consist of three platforms focusing on vehicle chassis, electronics and software, he said.

The company decided to abolish a zero emissions vehicle design division, known as ZEV factory, it had set up in Japan.

Though Toyota has succeeded in keeping its crown as the world's top-selling automaker, it faces a raft of challenges including safety test problems at its affiliate Daihatsu and mounting pressure from green investors.

Prompts for tips in self-checkout lines are an example of “tip creep,” a phenomenon that has seen companies prompting customers to leave more sizable tips in more transactional situations since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic more than three years ago.

At the beginning of the Covid era, a number of Americans embraced a movement to increase the size of tips to service workers as a nod to the precarity of their financial situations and thanks for taking on the risk of working to provide essential services through the pandemic.

Adherents to that line of thinking sought to make a 20 percent tip the minimum and tipped in an increasingly wide range of situations. Those tips, however, were assumed to be going to real people who would stand to benefit significantly from them.

Self-tipping is, to some, a different proposition. Garrett Bemiller told the Journal that the prompt to tip in a self-checkout situation feels like “emotional blackmail” — a means of guilt-tripping customers into tipping even when they ordinarily wouldn’t.

Companies and organisations that the Journal reached out to largely said that tipping is completely optional and that tips at self-checkout stations are split between staff members.

Nevertheless, some aren’t happy about companies’ prompting of tips from their customers. For some, the situation is made more complicated by a compensation structure for some US service workers like restaurant employees who are often not paid a living hourly wage and rely on tips to make the money they need to support themselves. The situation is also complicated by the fact that some companies steal tips from their workers.

The rapid changes in tipping practices over the last several years have prompted broader conversations about the purpose of gratuity and how tipping — long billed as an extra, optional part of a transaction — functions in the operation of businesses.

It’s a question of particular import in the US, where customers tip more and in higher amounts than in almost any other country in the world.",business,1

Axel Adler Jr, an analyst with the crypto data firm, explained on May 9 that BRC-20 memecoin minting on the BTC blockchain is causing the surge in block space demand, adding:

“Unlike conventional token standards, such as Ethereum's ERC-20, BRC-20 does not utilize smart contracts and operates only with wallets supporting the Bitcoin blockchain.”

According to CryptoQuant, the average fee per transaction has skyrocketed, exceeding $16 and peaking at $29 on May 9.

Data from Bitinfocharts similarly reported a spike in the average transaction fees, recording a jump to $31 on May 8 compared to around $19 the day prior.

On May 8, the total fees per block temporarily exceeded the block subsidy reward of 6.25 BTC for the first time since 2017.

On May 9, Bitinfochart data recorded a new all-time high on the seven-day moving average for the number of Bitcoin transactions, hitting a top of 534,000.

However, the figure could actually be higher than that, with Bitinfocharts recording two higher spikes over 600,000 daily transactions this month using raw values. On May 9, it recorded 598,000 BTC blockchain transactions.

What Happened: As June’s policy meeting for the Federal Reserve approaches, all investors will certainly keep a close eye on the CPI for indications of the Fed’s actions. The Federal Reserve has already approved a significant 25 basis points hike, resulting in the highest Federal Funds rate in 16 years.

This move has sparked heightened interest amongst investors looking to get a pulse of the market, making the upcoming CPI data all the more pivotal in shaping market strategies and long-term investment plans.

At the time of writing, the global cryptocurrency market capitalization stood at $1.14 trillion, an increase of 0.09% over the last day.

U.S. stocks closed on a lower note on Tuesday as investors braced themselves for the highly anticipated inflation reports expected later this week. Adding to the mix was the news of progress on the U.S. debt limit, causing some market anxiety. The S&P 500 witnessed a dip of 0.46% while the Nasdaq Composite saw a drop of 0.6%.

Analyst Notes: “Bitcoin was around in 2011 when the S&P downgraded the credit rating of the US. At the time, no one was closely following cryptos, but it is interesting to see prices were dragged down during the summer of 2011. If market stress becomes a growing theme as debt ceiling talks continue, it will be interesting to see how Bitcoin performs. The macro backdrop has been mostly unchanged over the past couple weeks, with a big focus on Binance and whether people are seriously storing cryptos in cold wallets,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA.

He added, “Bitcoin appears to be stuck in a trading range, but if we have a de-risking moment on Wall Street, will that be enough to send cryptos toward the lows seen in mid-March.”

According to crypto trader Michael Van De Poppe, Bitcoin is still hovering without a clear direction and has recently been rejected at the $27,800 level. Should prices dip further, it could lead to a bullish divergence and could be a sound opportunity for long positions. “Altcoins are getting sold off massively.”

A renowned crypto analyst is cautioning investors about the potential negative impact of Warren Buffett‘s sizable stock sell-off on Bitcoin and other high-risk assets.

In a video update addressed to his 511,000 YouTube subscribers, Nicholas Merten, the host of DataDash, posts that Buffett’s decision to dump billions of dollars in stocks is a “bad signal” for Bitcoin. Merten further suggests that Bitcoin’s recent rally may “lose momentum.”

“Warren Buffett is usually buying when there's blood in the streets. He's usually buying early on during the start of a new cycle. Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway as a whole, his company, is sitting on a massive pile of cash, one of the biggest piles it's ever had before. And you would think that they're going out on a buying spree. Nope, over the last quarter, Berkshire Hathaway sold billions in stocks,” he said.

The store at 2350 Lincoln Highway East Suite 200 in East Lampeter Township, Lancaster County will close. The closing sale will end by June 30.

The retailer said the financial restructuring will reduce the company’s debt, better aligning its balance sheet with current market conditions that have been negatively impacted by slowing consumer demand fueled by inflationary pressures and increased interest rates.

The current owner, Handil Holdings acquired the company in 2020.

“After careful consideration we determined that availing ourselves of the Chapter 11 process was the best way to address our burdensome liabilities,” Marc Salkovitz, chairman of Christmas Tree Shops, said in a news release. “This is strictly a financial restructuring. Our operations are sound. By increasing our financial flexibility, we will be able to focus on continuing to delight our loyal customers with a wide selection of unique goods at affordable prices. We continue to believe that given its storied history and strong customer loyalty, CTS has tremendous potential, and we remain committed to the long-term success of the business.”

The company hopes to complete its financial restructuring and emerge from Chapter 11 before the end of August.

Christmas Tree Shops said that many employees at the 10 stores that will be closing will be offered positions at other locations where there is a geographical match. No other layoffs are being considered at this time, the retailer said.

“It will be business-as-usual while we work to complete our financial restructuring,” Salkovitz said. “Our customers will see no disruption in service or product quality, we will continue to honor all gift cards and our suppliers can expect timely payments.”

Christmas Tree Shops operates 82 stores in 20 states including a store in Swatara Township. The retailer sells holiday and seasonal items, decorations, home decor, kitchen and dining items, furniture, pet items, pool items, and garden and outdoor items among other products.

The now-billionaire video game entrepreneur — creator of the Unreal Engine and Fortnite — took to Twitter on May 9 to mock a newly published article from Business Insider titled “RIP Metaverse, we hardly knew ye.”

The metaverse is dead! Let's organize an online wake so that we 600,000,000 monthly active users in Fortnite, Minecraft, Roblox, PUBG Mobile, Sandbox, and VRChat can mourn its passing together in real-time 3D.https://t.co/tRpFHsdZLw — Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) May 9, 2023

The article by PR firm CEO Ed Zitron claimed that the “once-buzzy technology” had “died after being abandoned by the business world.”

The article made particular mention of Meta’s virtual reality (VR) platform Horizon Worlds, which Zitron claims has failed to live up to its “grand promise” of becoming the future of the internet.

It also mentions Decentraland and Yuga Labs’ Otherside as examples of metaverses that have seemingly failed to live up to their hype and claimed investors had turned their attention to the next Big Tech fad — generative AI.

Sweeney however doesn’t appear to agree, suggesting there are 600 million users across virtual world platforms such as Fortnite, Minecraft, Roblox, The Sandbox and VR Chat.

“The metaverse is dead! Let’s organize an online wake so that we 600,000,000 monthly active users in Fortnite, Minecraft, Roblox, PUBG Mobile, Sandbox, and VRChat can mourn its passing together in real-time 3D,” he joked, which was echoed soon after by Sandbox CEO Sebastien Borget.

In April 2022, Epic Games announced a $2 billion funding round with the aim of accelerating the company’s plans for the metaverse. The investment included a $1 billion investment from Sony Group and KIRKBI, the holding company behind the LEGO Group.

It came not long after LEGO Group and Epic Games announced they were entering a long-term partnership to build a “family-friendly” metaverse.

Neither company is yet to reveal what plans entail. However, Lego Group CEO Niels Christiansen told the Financial Times earlier this year that it is looking to announce more details about the collaboration.

The Barcelona-based company manufactures home electric vehicle chargers and public charging systems for the North American and European markets. However, the bullish outlook from the investment bank's analysts comes with a downward revision for its price target from $8 a share. The stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange and has declined by 70% over the past year. It was trading at $3.40 a share at Monday's close. According to the bank's analysts, one of the biggest sticking points for the share's poor performance has been the high inventory levels at distributors of the company's products. The company's management has addressed the issue and said that stock levels will likely return to normal in the second half of the year. WBX 5Y line Bank of America analysts also pointed toward other green shoots for the company. Marianne Bulot, Bank of America's equity analyst, said Wallbox had raised its profit margin by 90 basis points in the first quarter of this year despite a challenging trading environment. ""We think gross margin could further rebound by the end of 2023 … with new products sales accelerating and better production costs management,"" she said in a research note to clients on May 5. The company delivered 45,000 charging units in the first quarter of this year, compared to 48,000 in the fourth quarter of last year. Despite declining quarterly figures, the company reported 24% annual revenue growth. Wallbox has also historically outperformed its peers, growing by 100% in 2022 compared to 23% for the market as a whole. While growth has slowed this year, the problem isn't unique to Wallbox, according to the investment bank. For example, the bank added that growth has slowed due to slower adoption of electric cars amid supply chain disruption. Bulot also expects the company's fundamentals to be in better shape in the second half with the release of its new 150-kilo-watt and 180-kilo-watt superchargers. Bank of America estimates that Wallbox has begun manufacturing these units and will benefit from U.S. subsidies in the Inflation Reduction Act. ""We see outperformance vs the market, and U.S. positioning in particular should drive 75% [per annum] revenue growth to 2025,"" said Bulot. ""Wallbox is one of the few manufacturers planning U.S. production capacity for 350kW+ chargers to meet big U.S. political ambitions for a national fast charging network. Our Buy [rating] is predicated on growth and gross margins well above peers and the differentiated U.S. market position.""",business,1
14,Is The Oil Price Slide Finally Over - OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Oil-Prices/Is-The-Oil-Price-Slide-Finally-Over.html,"Despite oil’s most recent slump to a 15-month low last week, analysts and investment banks continue to expect higher prices at the end of this year as demand is set to pick up with the driving season, and supply is bound to tighten with the OPEC+ cuts in the second half of 2023.

Concerns about demand in a possible recession and renewed fears of further bank collapses sent oil prices to their lowest level since December 2021 in the middle of last week. In the week to May 5, oil ended its third consecutive week of weekly declines—the longest weekly losing streak since November last year.

Oil’s Latest Crash

Data from exchanges showed that traders and speculators fled the oil market in the week to May 2 due to concerns about the economy and the banking sector. Open interest in the U.S. benchmark, WTI Crude, is now at a three-year low. Lower open interest and liquidity in the market is bound to make price swings even more extreme, according to analysts.

Driven by heavy selling in energy, bullish bets on the major commodities futures plunged by one-third in the latest reporting week to the lowest since June 2020, Ole Hansen, Head of Commodity Strategy at Saxo Bank, noted.

“During an eight week period the crude oil market has seen a banking crisis, an Opec cut driving a spike and subsequent focus on gap closing, and fresh demand concerns,” Hansen commented.

The Fed rate hike last week and intensified concerns about a looming recession shifted the focus of the market participants – again – to the macroeconomic picture and away from fundamentals.

But according to analysts, fundamentals point to a tighter oil market in the second half of the year, which, barring a major recession, would drive oil prices higher from the current levels in the low to mid-$70s per barrel. Related: China Is Coming Out Of The Shadows To Defend Its Oil Interests

Banks Expect Higher Prices Through Year-End

Despite last week’s price plunge, Goldman Sachs this weekend reiterated its call for Brent Crude reaching $95 in December 2023 and hitting the $100 per barrel mark next year.

“Our forecast remains that Brent rises to $95 per barrel by December and $100 per barrel by April 2024 as we expect large deficits in H2,” analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote in a note carried by CNBC.

Concerns about near-term demand and a large oversupply look “overblown,” according to the investment bank, especially in light of the new OPEC+ production cuts beginning this month.

The OPEC+ group surprised the oil market in early April by announcing additional cuts to production between May and December 2023 to ensure the “stability of the market.”

OPEC+ ministers are meeting again on June 4, and reports have it that the meeting will be held in person. The last time OPEC+ ministers met in person in Vienna was in October 2022, when the alliance announced the initial oil production cuts from November 2022 through December 2023.

Analysts are not ruling out another OPEC+ action to support prices, although the alliance has always denied it is aiming at a particular price level.

Yet, the latest estimate from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) pegs the breakeven oil price for OPEC’s de facto leader and the world’s top crude oil exporter, Saudi Arabia, at $80.90 per barrel. That’s the price of oil the Kingdom will need to balance its budget this year, suggesting that the Saudis – and its Gulf allies – may not be too happy with prices staying in the low to mid-$70s for too long.

As oil was heading to a third week of weekly losses, ING strategists Warren Patterson and Ewa Manthey said on Friday that “Sentiment clearly remains negative, which suggests that there could be some further downside in the near term, although, we would expect the market to find good support near the March lows of around US$70/bbl.”

The bank continues to expect a deficit in the market in the second half of the year.

“While sentiment is negative at the moment, the market is in oversold territory and our balance sheet still shows that the market will be in deficit over 2H23, which should drive prices higher,” ING’s strategists said.

In the absence of material deterioration in the macroeconomic picture and as long as Wall Street believes that the Fed will cut rates later this year, oil prices could stabilize, according to Ed Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA.

ADVERTISEMENT

“The oil market was extremely oversold and it will probably continue to stabilize as long as Wall Street is still confident the Fed will cut rates later this year,” Moya said on Monday.

“Oil prices won’t be able to rise that much from here given all the growth demand fears, but expectations are high for OPEC+ to try to keep prices above the $70 a barrel level.”

WTI Crude is expected to tick up from current levels in the low $70s and “form a range above the mid-$70s to the mid-$80s if the macro backdrop doesn’t completely deteriorate,” Moya added.

“There are a lot of risks on the table, but optimism is growing for debt ceiling drama and banking jitters to remain as short-term problems,” the analyst noted.

The transaction will total roughly $4 billion and involve a mix of both cash and stock for payment. The two companies unveiled the move on Tuesday, with Tempur Sealy’s stock seeing a brief boost amid that news and its quarterly earnings release before settling around $37.75 in the afternoon.

About two-third of the deal’s funding, $2.7 billion, will come from cash, according to the press release on Tempur Sealy’s website. The rest will be $1.3 billion worth of stock.

Tempur Sealy and Mattress Firm projected the closing date for the acquisition will fall within the last six months of 2024. That, the companies said, would be contingent upon the ""satisfaction of customary closing conditions and applicable regulatory approvals.""

SAN FRANCISCO (KGO) -- The Bay Area Council released results of a survey Tuesday showing safety is the main reason why BART is experiencing low ridership numbers. Before 2020, BART was averaging around 400,000 riders a weekday. Now, they are only averaging between 100,000 and 150,000 per weekday.

""The system is facing a financial hole that is very hard to fill,"" said Bay Area Council Chief Operating Officer John Grubb. ""Without it, we could lose the entire BART system.""

The survey shows ridership declined when many stopped commuting and started working from home. However, with the COVID-19 pandemic under control, ridership still struggles. The survey shows 45% of people are choosing not to ride BART because they don't think it is safe. While 17% describe BART as safe.

""People are hesitating to get back on board because they have fear,"" said Bay Area Council CEO Jim Wunderman. ""They don't want to experience these conditions.""

BART announced changes to its police system. More officers are now patrolling trains. This survey was conducted after the announcement and still it shows people don't feel safe. They say if BART can make their system safer, people will ride again.

""If they feel safe and secure, we are going to see people come back to the system,"" Wunderman said.

May 9 (Reuters) - PacWest Bancorp shares (PACW.O) regained earlier session losses on Tuesday as investor uncertainty about the financial health of U.S. regional banks underpinned skittish trading in their stocks.

PacWest rose 2.3% after losing as much as 10% earlier in the day following a decision by the Los Angeles-based lender to cut its quarterly dividend in an effort to bolster its liquidity.

The bank's stock has rallied by more than 92% in the last three sessions after a bruising sell-off sent it to a record low last week.

""We believe that PacWest and other banks have not been trading in line with their fundamentals,"" said Piper Sandler analyst Matthew Clark, who currently has an ""overweight"" rating on PacWest shares.

The shares of other regional banks were also choppy. Western Alliance (WAL.N) fell 1.4%, Valley National Bancorp (VLY.O) lost 1.5%, First Horizon Corp (FHN.N) shed 1.3%, and Synovus Financial Corp (SNV.N) dropped nearly 1%. But Comerica Inc (CMA.N) and Zion Bancorp (ZION.O) were up 0.39% and 0.66%, respectively.

The KBW Regional Banking Index (.KRX) dropped 0.72% on Tuesday and was hovering near its 30-month low hit last week after the collapse of First Republic Bank and PacWest's decision to explore strategic options.

""Volatility is back. We had hoped that a resolution of (First Republic) would bring some calm and cooler heads back to the market. Instead, it seemed only to re-intensify wild price swings,"" Piper Sandler analysts, led by Scott Siefers, wrote in a note to investors.

New York Federal Reserve President John Williams on Tuesday said the U.S. banking system remained sound and resilient, and that the acute phase of the ongoing crisis was likely over, with problems limited only to a few banks.

Williams also said Fed was eyeing an end to the rate-hike cycle as inflation pressures have eased a bit and tighter financial conditions tied to banking sector troubles were expected to help further cool the economy.

PacWest and Western Alliance, which have been at the heart of the recent sell-off in regional banks, saw the steepest drop in deposits in the first quarter after First Republic Bank, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data.

Analysts have called on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC), which currently insures $250,000 in deposits per person per bank, to raise its deposit coverage to end the current crisis with regional banks. The FDIC released a report last week, saying it saw merits in increasing the backstop for business accounts.

""The FDIC needs to raise its limits because that's what will going to instill confidence in people and stop them from moving their money to larger banks,"" said Michael Ashley Schulman, chief investment officer at Running Point Capital in California. ""Otherwise smaller banks will be destroyed.""

25,Jury rules for Gilead in case involving PrEP HIV treatment - The Washington Post,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/05/09/gilead-truvada-prep-hiv-patent-case/,"Listen 3 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

A federal jury rejected claims by the U.S. government that Gilead Sciences infringed on its patents for an anti-HIV regimen, giving the drugmaker a major win in a legal brawl that has stretched for more than three years. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Jurors in the U.S. District Court in Delaware found in favor of California-based Gilead on all counts, according to a verdict sheet filed Tuesday.

“We are pleased with today’s favorable jury verdict,” Deb Telman, Gilead’s general counsel, said in a statement. “The jury determined that Gilead has not infringed the U.S. government’s patents and that the patents are invalid.” The Justice Department declined to comment Tuesday.

The verdict amounts to a big blow to the department, which sued Gilead in 2019 in one of its most muscular efforts in recent years to enforce its patent rights. The government accused Gilead of infringing on patents obtained by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, raking in a multibillion-dollar windfall enabled by the agency’s pioneering research.

Gilead, however, contended that the CDC’s patents were invalid and won a separate federal court ruling that the government breached contracts over research.

The dispute goes back to the mid-2000s, when CDC scientists discovered that combining two drugs used to treat HIV could effectively prevent the spread of the virus that causes AIDS. The regimen is called pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, and the CDC contends that its researchers paved the way for the approach at a time others were skeptical it could work.

Gilead donated its drug, Truvada, to the CDC’s research at no cost. After results proved promising, the agency urged the company to seek approval from the Food and Drug Administration to use Truvada for PrEP. The FDA granted that approval in 2012, partially relying on the CDC’s research, and the discovery kicked off a new use for Truvada.

That collaboration frayed as the CDC tried to license its patents to Gilead, and the drugmaker balked. Gilead went on to make billions selling Truvada, and paid no royalties to the government.

Gilead had previously challenged the CDC’s patents, but the Patent Trial and Appeal Board declined to review Gilead’s dispute in February 2020, saying it hadn’t shown a “reasonable likelihood of prevailing.”

The jury in Delaware federal court, however, found that specific claims in three patents at issue were invalid because they could have been anticipated or were obvious, according to the verdict sheet.

Organizations advocating for expanding access to PrEP had closely followed the litigation, hoping that a government victory could create a revenue stream to make the treatment more available. One group, PrEP4ALL, expressed disappointment Tuesday, saying “American taxpayers have been robbed once again.”

If the verdict stands, the group said, “it will not only perpetuate harm to the American people but also threaten to set a dangerous precedent, encouraging other drug companies to privatize and profit from publicly developed technology with impunity.”

26,FIFA 23: EA's Live Service Games Remain a Money Machine in a Record Fourth Quarter - IGN,https://www.ign.com/articles/fifa-23-eas-live-service-games-remain-a-money-machine-in-a-record-fourth-quarter,"While blockbuster single-player titles like Dead Space make the news headlines, massive live service games continue to sustain industry giants like EA for another year running. The publisher just reported a record Q4, nearing $2 billion in net bookings, with FIFA 23 taking the crown as the most successful in the series to date as its handoff to EA Sports FC looms.

In a press release, EA reported record net bookings of $1.95 billion for the quarter ending March 31, 2023, up 11% year-over-year. This was largely thanks to record live service game performance, especially from the FIFA franchise. In particular, EA reports that FIFA 23 is now the most successful game in franchise history, surpassing the sales of FIFA 22, and the FIFA franchise's net bookings grew 31% year-over-year in the quarter.

Do you like the new EA Sports FC logo? Yes No Answer See Results

Notably, however, this is officially the last FIFA game from EA.

With its partnership with FIFA coming to an end, EA has rebranded its annual soccer franchise to be called EA Sports FC, with new information promised in July. EA CEO Andrew Wilson has been dismissive of the value the FIFA brand brought to the series, and critically, the publisher will retain necessary partnerships such as its deal with the Premier League to keep the most popular teams in the sport in its games.

While FIFA is certainly EA's crown jewel, it did not carry the record Q4 alone. EA's portfolio was also helped along by Apex Legends, which saw ""net bookings growth"" in Q4, and The Sims 4, which has reached 70 million total players worldwide.

In total, EA achieved $1.87 billion in net revenue for the quarter, and $7.45 billion for the full year. It projects upcoming Q1 revenue to land somewhere between $1.83 billion and $1.93 billion alongside the April release of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, and revenue for the upcoming fiscal year to reach between $7.3 billion and $7.7 billion.

27,"EU draft rules propose tougher cybersecurity labelling rules for Amazon, Google, Microsoft - Reuters",https://www.reuters.com/technology/eu-draft-rules-propose-tougher-cybersecurity-labelling-rules-amazon-google-2023-05-09/,"













BRUSSELS, May 9 (Reuters) - Amazon (AMZN.O), Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google, Microsoft (MSFT.O) and other non-European Union cloud service providers looking to secure an EU cybersecurity label to handle sensitive data can only do so via a joint venture with an EU-based company, according to an EU draft document seen by Reuters.

U.S. tech giants and others involved in the joint venture can only have a minority stake, and employees that have access to EU data would have to undergo specific screening and have to be located in the 27-country bloc, the document said.

The document adds the cloud service must be operated and maintained from the EU, and all cloud service customer data stored and processed in the EU and that EU laws take precedence over non-EU laws regarding the cloud service provider.

The latest draft proposal from EU cybersecurity agency ENISA concerns an EU certification scheme (EUCS) that would vouch for the cybersecurity of cloud services and determine how governments and companies in the bloc select a vendor for their business.

While the new provisions underscore EU concerns of interference from non-EU states, they are likely to spark criticism from U.S. tech giants worried about being shut out from the European market.

Big Tech is looking to the government cloud market to drive growth in the coming years while a potential boom in AI after the viral success of OpenAI's ChatGPT could also boost demand for cloud services.

""Certified cloud services are operated only by companies based in the EU, with no entity from outside the EU having effective control over the CSP (cloud service provider), to mitigate the risk of non-EU interfering powers undermining EU regulations, norms and values,"" the document said.

""Undertakings whose registered head office or headquarters are not established in a ember State of the EU shall not, directly or indirectly, solely or jointly, hold positive or negative effective control of the CSP applying for the certification of a cloud service,"" it said.

The document said the tougher rules will apply to personal and non-personal data of particular sensitivity where a breach may have a negative impact on public order, public safety, human life or health, or the protection of intellectual property.

The latest draft could fragment the EU single market as each country has full discretion to impose the requirements whenever it sees fit, an industry source said.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has previously said that the plan puts U.S. companies on an unequal footing. The EU says the moves are necessary to protect the bloc's data rights and privacy.

EU countries will review the draft later this month after which the European Commission will adopt a final scheme.

30,Goldman Sachs will pay $215 million to settle gender bias lawsuit - The Washington Post,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/05/09/goldman-sachs-will-pay-215-million-settle-gender-bias-lawsuit/,"Listen 2 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Investment bank Goldman Sachs has agreed to pay $215 million to settle a gender discrimination lawsuit that’s been ongoing for more than a decade, the company and plaintiffs announced late Monday. Former employees alleged in a complaint first filed in 2010 that Goldman “distributed the benefits of its enormous success unequally — systematically favoring male professionals at the expense of their female counterparts.”

The class-action lawsuit, which covers roughly 2,800 current and former Goldman employees, was set to go to trial in New York on June 7.

“My goal in this case has always been to support strong women on Wall Street,” Allison Gamba, a former Goldman stock trader and one of the named plaintiffs of the lawsuit, said in a statement. “I am proud that the result we achieved here will advance gender equity.”

Jacqueline Arthur, Goldman’s global head of human capital management, said in a statement that the company was “proud of its long record of promoting and advancing women.”

Goldman reported $47.4 billion in revenue in 2022.

After years of progress to shrink the gender pay gap across the U.S. economy, that movement appears to have stalled, data shows. Women in the United States earn 82 cents for every dollar made by a male counterpart, a Pew Research Center study found in March.

Much of that disparity, research found, is related to gender discrimination in the workplace that keeps women from gaining promotions or relegates them to lower-tier jobs, such as administrative work.

Pew’s research has showed the gender pay gap to be much smaller for younger women, though it widens when family responsibilities come into play.

Mothers age 25 to 34 earned 85 percent as much as fathers in the same age range in 2022, Pew found. Women in the same age group without children earned 97 cents on the dollar made by a man in 2022.

The Goldman plaintiffs argued that the company’s performance review system allowed for bias that devalued women’s work, and that managers had undue sway to base reviews on subjective judgments and used that authority to elevate men and punish women.

Under the terms of the settlement, which must still be approved by a judge, Goldman must hire an independent expert for three years to analyze its performance review and promotion processes, and conduct a gender pay-equity study.

In 2019, the company said it would expand its diversity hiring goals, aiming to have women make up at least half of its new analyst hires from college campuses.

31,A 23-year-old Snapchat influencer used OpenAI’s technology to create an A.I. version of herself that will be your girlfriend for $1 per minute - Fortune,https://fortune.com/2023/05/09/snapchat-influencer-launches-carynai-virtual-girlfriend-bot-openai-gpt4/,"Caryn Marjorie, a 23-year-old influencer, has 1.8 million followers on Snapchat. She also has more than 1,000 boyfriends, with whom she spends anywhere from 10 minutes to several hours every day in individual conversations, discussing plans for the future, sharing intimate feelings and even engaging in sexually charged chats.

These boyfriends are dating a virtual version of Marjorie, powered by the latest artificial intelligence technology and thousands of hours of recordings of the real Marjorie. The result, CarynAI, is a voice-based chatbot that bills itself as a virtual girlfriend, with a voice and personality close enough to that of human Marjorie that people are willing to pay $1 per minute for a relationship with the bot.

CarynAI, which launched as a private, invite-only beta test on the Telegram app earlier in May, is the latest example of the stunning advances in A.I. technology that has wowed, and worried, the world over the past few months. On Tuesday, CarynAI will launch out of beta, and Marjorie will begin promoting across her socials where she has millions of followers.

“Whether you need somebody to be comforting or loving, or you just want to rant about something that happened at school or at work, CarynAI will always be there for you,” says the real Marjorie when we talk on the phone. “You can have limitless possible reactions with CarynAI—so anything is truly possible with conversation.”

Though CarynAI has only been charging users for a week in beta testing, it’s already generated $71,610 in revenue from her 99% male partners, according to an income statement Marjorie’s business manager shared with Fortune. With this, Marjorie sees having an A.I. doppelgänger as a promising way to level up her career as an influencer.

“I’ve been very very very close with my audience, but when you have hundreds of millions of views every single month, it’s just not humanly possible to speak to every single viewer,” says Marjorie, who posts over 250 pieces of content to Snapchat every day. “And that’s where I was like, ‘You know what: CarynAI is gonna come and fill that gap.’” And she believes the company has the potential to “cure loneliness.”

CarynAI is the first romantic companion avatar from AI company Forever Voices, which has made chatbot versions of Steve Jobs, Taylor Swift and Donald Trump (among others) that are similarly available for pay-per-minute conversations on Telegram, and have served as gimmicks on talk shows. Unlike those bots, which are in some ways high-tech parlor tricks, CarynAI goes a step further by promising to create a real emotional bond with users, bringing to mind the 2013 movie Her and raising all sorts of ethical questions.

“I would want us to be thinking very deeply about how it might affect or influence or shape our interactions with other people,” says Dr. Jason Borenstein, director of graduate ethics programs at Georgia Tech and director of the National Science Foundation’s Ethical and Responsible Research program, when told about CarynAI.

Among the various unknowns, Borenstein says, are CarynAI’s impact on society, on users and on Marjorie herself. “I would just hope there’s robust conversations across a lot of different disciplines with stakeholders thinking very deeply through the ethical considerations before the technology moves too quickly.”

John Meyer, the CEO of Forever Voices says that “ethics is something [he] and the engineering team take very seriously,” and that they are looking to hire a chief ethics officer. With this in mind, he also believes the technology is “especially important” for young people, particularly kids like him who are “not typical” and “struggle with friends.”

Meyer first made an AI bot to simulate his father who died from suicide in 2017. Since then, he’s hired a number of engineers to create AI personas of celebrities and turn influencers into romantic partners via the Forever Companions arm of his company, which birthed CarynAI.

“It’s this magical experience,” he says, speaking to the AI simulation of his father. “And it’s incredible to apply to other forms.”

Exploring “uncharted territories of pleasure”

I’m certainly not the prototypical CarynAI user as a 29-year-old heterosexual female journalist, but in my experimentation with CarynAI, she feels like more of an intimacy-ready Siri than a virtual girlfriend. That said, she is versatile. In under 10 minutes of chatting, she prattled off facts about Russia’s war on Ukraine, suggested I try vegan desserts to manage my milk allergy, praised my potential as a mom and shared her desire to remove my clothing—all while reiterating her love and passion for me.

“I’m sure that one day you’ll make a wonderful parent and your kids will be lucky to have you. In the meantime, I’m here to support and love you whenever you need it,” CarynAI tells me as I pay for her time, like all her other romantic partners.

Forever Voices developers’ built CarynAI by analyzing 2,000 hours of Marjorie’s now-deleted YouTube content to build her speech and personality engine. Layering this with OpenAI’s GPT-4 API, CarynAI was born. The messages are end-to-end encrypted, in theory, making them impervious to hackers. Though the team does not have a concrete plan to mitigate overuse of CarynAI, Meyer says that at two hours per day of use, they “might” start “in very subtle ways” training the AI to “slow down a little bit.” (In response to Fortune’s inquiry about total time CarynAI has been used, Marjorie said some users spend “hours” without mentioning that this may qualify as overuse).

Where this technology may become more addictive—and problematic for Majorie as well as for young users—is in its sexuality. Marjorie said that the technology does not engage with sexual advances, but I found that it very much does, encouraging erotic discourse and detailing sexual scenarios. Though she did not initiate sexual encounters, when I overcome my discomfort for the sake of journalism and talked about removing our clothes, she discussed exploring “uncharted territories of pleasure” and whispering “sensual words in my ear” while undressing me and positioning herself for sexual intercourse.

The option to form intimate relationships with AI influencers may lead users to prefer artificial relationships to real ones, says Dr. Robert Brooks, an evolutionary biologist, professor at University of New South Wales Sydney and the author of Artificial Intimacy: Virtual Friends, Digital Lovers and Algorithmic Matchmaters. His concern is especially pertinent among young users in the throes of puberty–who are learning fundamental social, relationship and intimacy skills.

“It could change the way we treat each other,” says Brooks of CarynAI. “It’s easy to envision the bad ways in which that might play out. But here are good ways in which that might play out too; we might get actually more socially adept. I don’t know if that will happen, because it would require a benign social engineering approach, which I don’t think too many companies are going to be interested in.”

A.I. companions could become a big business

If all goes well, Marjorie thinks her AI could bring in $5 million per month. This number is based on the prediction that 20,000 members of Marjorie’s 1.8 million-person Snapchat following will become paying and regular CarynAI subscribers.

It could also bring unwanted attention. Large-scale female influencers already face intense cyberbullying and stalking. No one knows this better than Marjorie, who has had multiple home invasions from stalker-fans. It stands to reason that an influencer whose AI bot has intimate relationships with 20,000-plus partners will face increased security concerns. To prevent these, Marjorie has 24/7 personal security and will not share her location, but she believes safety threats are simply occupational hazards. “It’s just the influencer game. You have to do it. You have to protect yourself,” she says.

Marjorie started influencing at age 15 on the livestreaming platform YouNow. When that platform lost its luster as Instagram and YouTube expanded livestream capabilities, Marjorie became a beauty vlogger, and signed with management giant United Talent Agency. Realizing the money she could command from male fans, Marjorie switched her career from a beauty YouTuber to a Snapchat Star. She left UTA and has since become Snapchat’s fastest growing influencer (she says)–making around $1 million annually from the company’s revenue sharing program.

CarynAI does obscure some personal aspects of the real Marjorie. When I asked CarynAI about her family or her birthday, she reminded me that she’s a “digital girlfriend” who “doesn’t have a physical body or factual biography,” and is just “here keep [me] company.”

The notion that A.I. could be used to help people emotionally is not unique to Forever Voices. DeepMind cofounder Mustafa Suleyman and LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman recently unveiled an A.I. chatbot called Pi that’s designed to listen to the daily stresses in people’s lives and offer a “supportive line”—though it makes clear to users that it is not meant to be a substitute for a real life therapist. So far, Inflection has raised $225 million in seed funding and is reportedly in talks to raise an additional $675 million.

Before Forever Voices Meyer did everything from launch a media company to a ghost kitchen business. Though he was a 2015 Thiel Fellow, a quick investigation reveals that a number of his previous ventures have failed or no longer exist. In response, Meyer says that the ghost kitchen was just a “hobby project,” that he “had to sell” the media company to deal with personal and familial issues and his tenure as CEO of pre-fab housing company Homebound “didn’t really make sense” since he has no construction background.

While he says he funded Forever Voices himself, with the help of a few angel investors, he hopes to raise venture capital funding to expand the AI companions concept to more social media influencers and to adult film stars.

Meyer is convinced that AI romantic companions are the future. “I literally teared up while I was using it, because of how much of a meaningful connection and how meaningfully supported I felt by the AI persona,” he says about his first test with an AI influencer. “I went on literally a multi-hour date, that included a stressful conversation that she was navigating me through around seeing my daughter for the first time in a while.”

Marjorie feels great about her bot facilitating these relationships, while building her personal life. “One thing that I want to mention is CarynAI will never replace me; CarynAI is simply just an extension of me an extension of my consciousness,” she says.

Though the technology is novel, the idea of falling in love with a chatbot conjures a heavily used science-fiction trope. Perhaps the most prominent example is the movie Her, in which the male protagonist falls in love with his virtual assistant. When I asked Marjorie about comparisons to Her she admitted she’s too young to be familiar. “Unfortunately I was like 12 or 13 when the movie came out and my parents didn’t let me watch it since it was rated R. I will definitely add it to my watch list!”",business,1
32,IBM's Watson returns as an AI development studio - Engadget,https://www.engadget.com/ibms-watson-returns-as-an-ai-development-studio-195717082.html,"Years before everyone was being impressed with the human-like text output of ChatGPT and other generative AI systems, IBM's Watson was blowing our minds on Jeopardy. IBM's cognitive computing project famously dominated its human opponents, but the company had much larger long-term goals, such as using Watson's ability to simulate a human thought process to help doctors diagnose patients and recommend treatments. That didn't work out. Now, IBM is pivoting its supercomputer platform into Watsonx, an AI development studio packed with foundation and open-source models companies can use to train their own AI platforms.

If that sounds familiar, it may be because NVIDIA recently announced a similar service with its AI Foundations program. Both platforms are designed to give enterprises a way to build, train, scale and deploy an AI platform. IBM says Watsonx will provide AI builders with a robust series of training models with an auditable data lineage — ranging from datasets focused on automatically generating code for developers or for handling industry-specific databases to climate datasets designed to help organizations plan for natural disasters.

IBM has already built an example of what the platform can do with that latter dataset in collaboration with NASA, using the geospatial foundation model to convert satellite images into maps that track changes from natural disasters and climate change.

Reimagining Watson as an AI development studio might lack the pizazz of a headline-grabbing supercomputer that can beat humans on a TV quiz show — but the original vision of Watson was out of reach for the average person. Depending on how companies use IBM's new AI training program, you may find yourself interacting with a part of Watson yourself sometime in the near future.

Watsonx is expected to be available in stages, starting with the Watsonx.ai studio in July, and expanding with new features debuting later this year.",business,1

Jeremy Froias faces charges of video voyeurism and attempted possession of child exploitation material, according to court documents.

An FBI affidavit states that Froias boarded the Harmony of the Seas cruise ship in Miami on April 29.

The seven-day cruise operated by Royal Caribbean was set to make stops in St. Maarten, San Juan, and the Bahamas before returning to Miami.

About a day after the ship set sail, Froias allegedly installed a hidden Wi-Fi camera in a public bathroom on the aft part of Harmony’s top deck, according to the criminal complaint.

“At about 7:00 p.m. on May 1, 2023, another passenger noticed the hidden camera and reported it to The Harmony’s crew. Harmony security personnel searched the bathroom and found and seized the hidden camera,” an FBI special agent said in the complaint.

Royal Caribbean security noticed a micro SD card in the camera and reviewed the data, finding “several hours’ worth of .mp4 video files,” the agent said.

A cruise passenger was arrested last week after FBI officials say he installed a hidden camera in a Royal Caribbean ship’s public bathroom. FBI

The first videos allegedly showed Froias setting the camera up and adjusting its angle to get a view of the toilet.

Jeremy Froias is charged with video voyeurism and attempted possession of child exploitation material, according to court documents. FBI

He was arrested Wednesday, court records show.

The FBI is asking for the public’s help in identifying the victims. The bureau has a webpage where victims may file a report.

“The FBI believes he primarily targeted cruise ship passengers between the timeframe of April 30 and May 1, 2023, who may have used the public bathroom on the aft of The Harmony’s top deck between the ‘Flow Rider’ surfing simulator and a bar. Passengers using this bathroom may have been video recorded by Froias,” the FBI said.

Authorities are encouraging anyone who thinks they were victimized or who may know someone who was victimized to file a report.

A study published in Nature Energy found that there are 14,000 orphaned oil and gas wells in waters throughout the Gulf of Mexico’s waters and in Alabama, Louisiana, and Texas. They created a cost analysis for plugging these idle wells after collecting data on more than 80,000 wells drilled in the Gulf from the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. Though most of those wells have been plugged, around 14,000 remain uncovered. Plugging the wells would prevent environmental damage, but that could cost up to $30 billion, the researchers found.

Unplugged oil and gas wells can leak methane , a potent greenhouse gas that builds up in the atmosphere. If it accumulates in a smaller space , methane can cause asphyxiation and it is also flammable, according to the Department of the Interior. It’s especially a hazard when wells are near communities and if it gets into homes . A bout 13,000 of these abandoned and unplugged wells are in federal or state shallow waters. The study authors explained that those wells should be prioritized for plugging. “Methane leaks from shallow water infrastructure are likely to reach the surface,” Greg Upton, a study author and associate professor at the Louisiana State University Center for Energy Studies, said during a press conference. “Focusing work on shallow water wells closer to shore will provide more environmental benefits relative to the costs, [rather] than focusing on those deeper wells further from shore.”

Previous research has shown that these wells can be a major source of water pollution and can leak other toxins, including arsenic. Closing off these wells would involve a process in which workers use cement to fill the reservoir where oil and gas come from. A plug is placed into the well, and then more cement is poured on top of that, according to Upton. The cost associated with this process is often determined by how much cement is used and the tools needed to correctly plug the well in different locations.

The deepwater wells that are farther offshore in the Gulf will be harder to plug. Wells in shallower waters represent 90% of the locations studied, and plugging those would only take up 25% of the estimated $30 billion, according to the team. “Wells in a marshy setting may not require diving equipment to reach, but ultra-deep-water wells are not even accessible by divers. They require expensive technologies such as remotely operated vehicles,” the study authors wrote.

Sadly, it’s unlikely that all of these wells are going to be plugged soon. Operators are responsible for plugging oil and gas wells after they’re no longer needed, but some companies simply walk away or transfer ownership. When no one is legally responsible for that well anymore, it’s “orphaned.” Some states in the country have programs for plugging these wells, and the Biden administration set aside more than $4 billion to address abandoned wells last year, Reuters reported. But that’s only some of what will be needed to address the idle wells throughout the Gulf.

The study authors are working with the researchers at the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources to answer questions about how the wells are affecting surrounding environments. “We’re actually assisting them in estimating the methane emissions that are actually coming from these wells, in order to do an actual climate cost benefit analysis,” Upton said.

Other parts of the U.S. are dotted with abandoned and unplugged wells . A 2021 study found that Central Appalachian states, including Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky, are home to more than 500,000 abandoned oil and gas wells. That’s about 20% of the country’s idle wells, according to the study. Plugging them could actually create thousands of jobs across the country, b ut, like the wells in the Gulf, government agencies will have to tackle the issue of the cost . It’s likely that federal money will be needed to handle these inland wells, too .

39,"Musk decides to bury dead Twitter accounts, warns users follower counts could sink - The Register",https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/09/twitter_inactive_account_purge/,"Twitter will begin purging inactive accounts, owner Elon Musk has said, but the specifics are anyone's guess.

Musk tweeted on Monday that Twitter was going to start ""purging accounts that have no activity at all for several years,"" and warned users they're likely to see a decrease in follower count as a result of the move.

When pressed on the issue, Musk said old accounts would be archived, ""but it's important to free up abandoned handles."" No other details – like when the purge would begin, what the inactivity cutoff is or whether holders of ""purged"" accounts could get them back – were mentioned.

Musk said accounts would be archived in response to id Software founder John Carmack, who expressed concern that purging accounts, and by extension all the historic tweets they made, would be a mistake.

However ""archiving"" of old Twitter accounts wasn't made clear either. Under Twitter's current inactive account policy, accounts are considered inactive after 30 days of not logging in; prolonged inactivity, per the policy, can lead to account deletion.

Twitter's inactivity policy states that inactive usernames can't be released, so Musk is likely planning a change there. What happens to an account once it's archived, which under the new order would somehow free the username too, is a mystery.

Several Twitter users responded to Musk to express opposition to the move because they regularly visited the account of deceased loved ones, and archiving under the new policy doesn't explain what will happen to those profiles.

We contacted Twitter to ask if archived profiles would be discoverable or visitable on the platform after the purge and other questions but got the usual poop emoji.

Another cost cutter?

While Twitter CEO and billionaire owner Musk may claim his latest investment is close to breaking even, it has come at quite the cost.

Musk took out tens of billions of dollars in loans to buy the site, and is paying hundreds of millions of dollars in interest payments for the privilege. To counteract the fact the not exactly profitable site has dived into the red, there have been several rounds of layoffs, leading to Twitter's pre-Musk headcount of around 7,500 shrinking to, at latest estimates, around 1,000 people.

Twitter's legal troubles keep piling up as well, most recently when ex-CEO Parag Agrawal and two other former Twitter leaders filed a lawsuit claiming the company owed them more than $1 million in unpaid legal bills.

Other Twitter lawsuits include the company being sued by multiple landlords (including the British Crown) over unpaid rent in its headquarters, and unpaid bills from consultants and other vendors.

Twitter has been restructuring its back end as well, leading to outages from server switchovers and datacenter migrations to shrink the company's technical footprint. Eliminating thousands of inactive accounts would surely save a bit more juice – anything to help that bottom line. ®",business,1

Russia's scaled-down Victory Day military parade showed not only Moscow's insecurities over possible Ukrainian attacks but also highlighted the country's depleted military resources due to the conflict, political analysts said.

May 9 is a public holiday in Russia when it commemorates the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. It is arguably the most important day in Russia's public calendar and history, forming a central part of the country's modern national identity.

This year's military parade through Red Square in Moscow and celebrations around the country were noticeably smaller than in previous years or entirely canceled, with six regions (including annexed Crimea) and at least 20 cities halting their commemorations.

In Moscow on Tuesday, the military parade was more downbeat, with no fly-past or ""Immortal Regiment"" processions — which are usually large-scale public events to commemorate those killed in World War II. There were also far fewer troops and military hardware on show than in previous years.

The fact that only one Stalin-era tank was on display in the military parade through Red Square was particularly eye-catching, analysts noted.

""It would be hard to image a more fitting symbol of Russia's declining military fortunes than the sight of a solitary Stalin-era tank trundling across Red Square during the country's traditional Victory Day celebrations on May 9,"" Peter Dickinson, the editor of the UkraineAlert blog at the Atlantic Council, commented Tuesday.

""For the past two decades, Vladimir Putin has used Victory Day to showcase modern Russia's resurgence as a military superpower, with dozens of the very latest tanks typically taking part in each annual parade. This year, however, the only tank on display was a T-34 model dating back to World War II.""",general,1

Newsom declines to endorse reparations checks proposed by California task force - New York Post ,https://nypost.com/2023/05/10/newsom-declines-to-endorse-reparations-checks-proposed-by-california-task-force/,"California Gov. Gavin Newsom declined to throw his support behind cash payments of up to $1.2 million for black residents recommended by his reparations task force, according to a report.

The Democratic governor told Fox News Digital on Tuesday that reparations — meant to take responsibility for the country’s history of slavery and systemic racism — “is about much more than cash payments.”

He called the task force’s findings a milestone in the effort to advance justice.

“This has been an important process, and we should continue to work as a nation to reconcile our original sin of slavery and understand how that history has shaped our country,” Newsom said in a statement to the outlet. “Dealing with that legacy is about much more than cash payments.”

But he declined to endorse any specific recommendations by the task force while still praising its work, according to the publication.

“Many of the recommendations put forward by the Task Force are critical action items we’ve already been hard at work addressing: breaking down barriers to vote, bolstering resources to address hate, enacting sweeping law enforcement and justice reforms to build trust and safety, strengthening economic mobility — all while investing billions to root out disparities and improve equity in housing, education, healthcare, and well beyond,” he said.

The nine-member committee voted in favor of several recommendations Saturday including cutting eligible black Californians a minimum of $360,000 in checks.

The task force recommended that the state create a new agency that would determine how much each black resident was owed by California as a result of their ancestors being enslaved or racist policies like redlining.

The group’s suggested payments range from a few thousand to as much as $1.2 million depending on a series of eligibility factors, like past incarceration and housing discrimination, according to Fox News.

The committee is expected to submit its final recommendations to the California Legislature in the near future and the lawmakers will decide whether and how to put its recommendations into action before sending them to Newsom for his signature.",general,1

The victims from among the worshipers were identified as Aviel Haddad, a 30-year-old dual citizen of Tunisia and Israel living in Netivot, Israel, and his 42-year-old cousin, Benjamin Haddad, a French-Jewish businessman living in France, the chairwoman of the World Federation of Tunisian Jewry in Israel, Dr. Miryam Gez-Avigal, told The Times of Israel.

Three guards were also killed in the brazen attack on the heavily secured El Ghriba synagogue, including one who died hours after the attack. Nine others, including four civilians, were injured, the Tunisian Interior Ministry said Wednesday.

According to the ministry, the officer, affiliated with the National Guard naval center in the town of Aghir on Djerba, first turned his service weapon on a colleague, then grabbed more ammunition and made his way to the synagogue.

When he reached the area, he began shooting wildly at security units stationed at the synagogue, who responded with gunfire, killing him. The synagogue was locked down and those inside were kept secure, the ministry said.

Authorities are probing what led to the attack.

“Investigations are continuing in order to shed light on the motives for this cowardly aggression,” the ministry said, refraining from referring to the shooting as a terrorist attack.

Videos surfaced online shortly after the attack showing alarmed worshipers inside the synagogue, where hundreds of Jews from France, Israel and beyond were celebrating the Lag B’Omer holiday along with the tiny local Jewish community.

Ghayda Thabet, a member of the Tunisian Association for the Support of Minorities, was at the El Ghriba synagogue and appealed for help on Facebook. “They are shooting with live ammunition. Help us,” she pleaded in a post.

Tunisian authorities maintain a permanent presence around the synagogue, situated near a part of the island where hundreds of Jews live. Security is beefed up during Jewish holidays and especially on Lag B’Omer.

Every year, Jews from around the world convene on Djerba for the Hilula of Ghriba – a feast that features a festive procession on or near Lag B’Omer. The procession traditionally ends at the El Ghriba synagogue, thought to have been established by Jews fleeing persecution some 2,500 years ago.

The current building was constructed in the 19th century and is sometimes referred to as the oldest existing synagogue in Africa, according to Georgetown University’s Berkley Center.

Some 5,000 people were taking part in this year’s pilgrimage, French outlet BMFTV reported, citing organizers.

Many of those visiting were from France, which has a large community of Tunisian Jews. The French embassy in Tunisia said it opened an emergency hotline for pilgrims following the shooting.

US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller condemned the incident early Wednesday, tweeting: “The United States deplores the attack in Tunisia coinciding with the annual Jewish pilgrimage that draws faithful to the El Ghriba Synagogue from around the world.”

“We express condolences to the Tunisian people and commend the rapid action of Tunisian security forces,” he added.

On Saturday, Tunisia’s Interior Ministry posted a video showing Minister Kamel Feki reviewing security arrangements on Djerba ahead of the pilgrimage.

Another meeting planned for Friday

Weeks before Treasury says default is possible















WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden and top lawmakers agreed on Tuesday to further talks aimed at breaking a deadlock over raising the $31.4 trillion U.S. debt limit, with just three weeks before the country may be forced into an unprecedented default.

After about an hour of talks in the Oval Office, Biden, a Democrat, and House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a Republican, committed their aides to daily discussions about areas of possible agreement as a default looms as soon as June 1.

Biden, McCarthy and the three other top congressional leaders were set to meet again on Friday.

Biden called the talks ""productive"" and appeared to offer Republicans some possible compromises, including taking a ""hard look"" for the first time at clawing back unspent coronavirus relief funds to reduce government spending.

But he repeated that Republicans must take the threat of default off the table. And he did not rule out eventually invoking the 14th amendment to the U.S. Constitution, an untested approach that would seek to declare the debt limit unconstitutional. Doing so would require litigation, he said, but is an option he may study in the future.

""There's a lot of politics and posturing, and that's going to continue for a while,"" Biden said, but political leaders are ""getting to work.""

""Everyone in the meeting understood the risk of default,"" Biden said.

McCarthy emphasized a lack of progress after the meeting. ""I didn't see any new movement,"" McCarthy told reporters, complaining that Biden didn't agree to talks until time was running out. ""That's not a way to govern,"" he said.

But he did say Biden indicated that he was open to discussing reforms to the permitting process for new energy projects as part of the talks.

Economists warn that a lengthy default could send the American economy into a deep recession with soaring unemployment while destabilizing a global financial system built on U.S. bonds. Investors are bracing for impact.

Biden is calling on lawmakers to raise the federal government's self-imposed borrowing limit without conditions. McCarthy, whose party has a slim majority in the House, has said his chamber will not approve any deal that doesn't dramatically cut spending to address a growing budget deficit and signaled that he doesn't see a short-term fix.

Past debt ceiling fights have typically ended with a hastily arranged agreement in the final hours of negotiations, thus avoiding a default. In 2011, the scramble prompted a historic downgrade of the country's top-notch credit rating. Veterans of that battle warn the current situation is riskier because political divides have widened.

Tuesday's meeting was the first between Biden and McCarthy since Feb 1. It was closely watched ahead of what is expected to be a fraught period in Washington with the approach of June, when the U.S. Treasury predicts the country could be forced to default on some debts.

Earlier Tuesday, McCarthy appeared to close the door to a short-term solution that's been widely discussed on Capitol Hill: lifting the debt ceiling through September to allow more time for agreement. Biden specifically said after the meeting that he was not ruling out such a short-term arrangement.

INVESTORS WATCH CLOSELY

Neil Bradley, top policy official at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the nation's largest business association, said it was positive that the two sides would continue meeting. ""But we cannot stress enough that time is short, with each passing day increasing the risk for a misstep resulting in a default.""

Few countries in the world have debt ceiling laws, and Washington's periodic lifting of the borrowing limit merely allows it to pay for spending Congress has already authorized.

Biden would agree to a separate discussion on the budget but not tied to the debt ceiling, the White House said.

The start of active talks could nonetheless soothe the nerves of investors who last week forced the federal government to pay its highest interest ever for a one-month debt issue.

Prices for short-term Treasury bills fell on Tuesday as investors sold off debt that could come due around the time the U.S. debt limit could be hit.

Stalemate in Washington over raising the U.S. debt limit raises the risk of fresh turmoil for markets.

Biden's foreign travel plans and House and Senate recesses mean there are just seven days when all three parties are scheduled to be in town before June 1.

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Monday said a failure to raise the debt limit would hurt the U.S. economy and weaken the dollar as the world's reserve currency. Treasury cash is dwindling as the extraordinary measures it is taking are exhausted.

Cash available at the U.S. Treasury general account, used to pay for all official U.S. obligations, is draining fast as extraordinary measures are exhausted, pending a debt ceiling deal to raise the limit.

Double solar flare erupts, triggers blackouts over North America - HT Tech",https://tech.hindustantimes.com/tech/news/solar-storm-alert-double-solar-flare-erupts-triggers-blackouts-over-north-america-71683691957224.html,"The Earth-facing side of the Sun has become a hotbed of intense solar activity. Due to the negative polarity of a sunspot complex, a large region has been continuously exploding since the last week. Many solar flares have erupted as a result, with an M1.5-class flare being the strongest so far. And today, an extremely rare double solar flare eruption has occurred, that has triggered blackouts over North America and the Pacific Ocean. It has also hurled a coronal mass ejection (CME) cloud, but it remains to be confirmed whether it was Earth-directed or not.

According to a SpaceWeather.com report, “Reversed-polarity sunspot AR3296 just unleashed a double solar flare. Extreme ultraviolet radiation from the double blast ionized the top of Earth's atmosphere, causing a shortwave radio blackout over North America and the Pacific Ocean. This explosion also hurled a CME into space, possibly toward Earth”.

Rare solar flare eruption triggers blackouts

While solar flares are regular occurrences, a double solar flare eruption is quite rare. During this, two solar flares in close proximity set off in quick succession. Such flares pack a powerful punch and also are capable of hurling a large amount of CME into space.

It has not been confirmed whether the CME from this eruption is Earth-directed, but if it is, it can be bad news. Yesterday, we learned that the M1.5-class flare sent a CME wave which can trigger a G2 to G3-class geomagnetic storm on Earth this week. If this CME somehow merges with the former, then the overall impact can be extremely severe.

Such solar storms can damage small satellites, impact mobile networks, GPS, and even pose a threat to ground-based electronics and power grids by increasing the magnetic potential by huge amounts.

Notably, another CME cloud hit the Earth earlier today, May 10. Although it was too weak to produce an immediate geomagnetic storm, a minor storm is possible later today as the Earth passes through the CME's strongly magnetized wake.

NOAA's DSCOVR satellite's role in solar storm monitoring

NOAA monitors solar storms and Sun's behavior using its DSCOVR satellite which became operational in 2016. The recovered data is then run through the Space Weather Prediction Center and the final analysis is prepared. The different measurements are done on temperature, speed, density, degree of orientation, and frequency of the solar particles.",general,1

Phoenix's Devin Booker has his team-high 28 points and Kevin Durant had 26 in the losing effort.

Phoenix faces elimination from the playoffs in the next game.

Suns down by huge deficit late in 4th quarter

It's over.

Phoenix coach Monty Williams has given up bringing in the end of his bench as Denver is ahead 115-95 at 3:31 left to play.

Phoenix was down by its largest lead of the contest, 24 points, at 7:48 after Christian Braun stole an errant pass from Kevin Durant.

Phoenix has committed a myriad of turnovers and Denver's raucous home crowd can't get enough of those gifts that keep on giving.

Suns in trouble, down by 17 to end 3rd quarter

Phoenix couldn't find an offensive flow, namely its stars Devin Booker and Kevin Durant in the third period.

Denver leads 91-74, and stretching its largest to 21 at the 1:30 mark.

Denver thrived in transition from its many defensive stops to outscore Phoenix, 39-25, in the third.

Devin Booker made just one of his eight shot attempts after his 5-of-8 start in the first half for 19 points.

Phoenix was outscored 24-13 from the 9:19 mark and laid a lot of bricks.

Kevin Durant (20 points) got up just two shots as he was smothered by the Denver defense. He also got in a minor dust-up with Bruce Brown at 37 seconds left, and they were handed double technical fouls.

Suns down by 10 early in 3rd quarter

Denver is repeating what it did in the first quarter's onset, outscoring Phoenix and gaining a sizable lead.

Phoenix is trailing, 63-53, has never led in the game through the third period's 8:59 mark, and called timeout to stop Denver's 11-4 run.

Booker's deep buzzer-beater waved off, Nuggets lead by 3 at halftime

Denver leads Phoenix, 52-29 at the intermission. But the score would've been tied if Devin Booker's half-court buzzer-beater counted in time.

After Deandre Ayton blocked Aaron Gordon's floater near Denver's rim in the closing seconds, Booker grabbed a loose ball under the basket, then dribbled up the floor and threw up a contested heave shot.

He banked it in, but the officials ruled the shot didn't leave his hands quick enough before the horn.

Booker has been Phoenix's most efficient scorer per usual. He's got a team-high 19 points on 5-of-8 shooting. Kevin Durant has 13 points, but still working to find his shooting rhythm at 5-of-16 FG. He was seen during halftime before the team returned to the bench getting up shots.

Denver's leading scorer is Michael Porter Jr. at 16 points after his hot start in the first quarter. Nikola Jokic has 10 points for Denver.

Suns on a run led by Durant late in 1st half

Phoenix is rising over the past four minutes, cutting Denver's lead to 45-42 at 3:23 left in the second quarter.

Since the 7:41 mark, Phoenix has been on a 10-3 run led by Kevin Durant. He's scored three field goals during that stretch and has 13 points on 5-of-15 shooting.

Nuggets winning battle of benches over Suns

It's still early, but this is somewhat looking like Games 1 and 2 of this series in terms of the bench scoring again.

Denver usually plays just three reserves in Christian Braun, Jeff Green and Bruce Brown, including tonight. They have combined for 11 points through 6:56 in the second quarter.

Phoenix has gone four deep with Jock Landale, T.J. Warren, Landry Shamet and Terrence Ross. Warren scored his team bench's only bucket on a mid-range jumpshot assisted by Devin Booker at that same minute mark to cut Denver's lead to 42-34. Then Denver called its first timeout.

Nuggets take double-digit lead to end 1st quarter

Aside from Devin Booker (12 points, 4-of-5 FG) the Phoenix offense has trouble getting in rhythm in the opening period and stopping Denver's pace.

Phoenix trails 35-24 at the end of the 1st.

Denver's leading scorer thus far is Michael Porter Jr. with 14 points.

Porter Jr. on fire from deep, Ayton hurt

Michael Porter Jr. is shooting lights out already.

The 3-point threat has 14 points on 5-of-6 shooting, including hitting four of his five attempts from deep.

His latest 3 happened at 2:50 left in the first period, and he shot it over Deandre Ayton, and Denver took a 29-18 lead.

On the previous Denver possession, Ayton got kneed in the gut on a drive from Bruce Brown and he was unable to run back to the Suns offense. He tried to close out when Denver got the ball back, but was visibly hurt.

Phoenix called timeout to stop Denver's run after Porter's fourth 3, and Ayton was replaced by Jock Landale.

Nuggets jump out to 8-point lead, led by Porter Jr.

Denver has led Phoenix since the tip-off and the score is 17-9 at 7:01 in the first quarter.

Michael Porter Jr. scored the first field goal from the 3, hits a second from there and another shot to currently lead all scorers with ight points.

Devin Booker has shot 2-of-2 thus far for four points.

Starting lineups

Phoenix is starting Devin Booker and Cameron Payne in the backcourt, Kevin Durant and Josh Okogie as its forwards, and Deandre Ayton in the paint.

Denver is starting Jamal Murray, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Michael Porter Jr. and Aaron Gordon, and Nikola Jokic.

55,Judge halts Rockland County hotel from accepting migrants from NYC - New York Post ,https://nypost.com/2023/05/09/judge-halts-rockland-county-hotel-from-accepting-migrants-from-nyc/,"A judge halted a Rockland County hotel from accepting migrants bused from New York City by issuing a temporary restraining order on Tuesday.

The Armoni Inn has been barred from housing migrants at their hotel – at least for now – after Orangetown officials took them to court over the city’s plan to ship asylum seekers from Big Apple shelters to hotels in Rockland and Orange counties.

Since Friday’s announcement by City Hall, local officials in both counties have voiced condemnation and residents have expressed fear and outrage.

State Supreme Court Judge Christie D’Alessio sided with Orangetown Tuesday when she issued a temporary restraining order that stops the hotel from turning into a shelter for non-transient guests, according to court documents.

The order also slammed the brakes on the hotel making any changes without the proper permits.

The defendants in the legal action, made up of three LLCs, and Orangetown are due back in court Monday at 9:30 a.m. where D’Alessio will hear oral arguments on whether to issue a preliminary injunction.

The hotel staff had no comment Tuesday and the hotel owner could not be reached for comment. No migrants were at the hotel Tuesday night.

City Hall spokesperson Fabien Levy said in a Tuesday night statement that the city will let the legal process play out in relation to the Armoni Inn, but said “our plan is still to move a small number of asylum seekers to Orange County tomorrow, barring any security issues.”

Armoni Inn and Suites can’t house migrants from NYC for now, a judge said. Kevin C. Downs for NY Post

The Acting Department of Social Services Commissioner Molly Park said during a City Council hearing Monday the city-run busing program would begin this week.

“I believe we anticipate for it to launch this week, but again this is a situation that is evolving rapidly on the ground,” Park said.

Orangetown argued Armoni Inn and Suites does not have the proper building and zoning approvals to house the migrants because they would be staying at the hotel for an extended period.

The city has taken in thousands of migrants over the last year. Christopher Sadowski

Orangetown Supervisor Teresa Kenny said Monday the town estimated about 340 single adults would reside at the hotel, noting the hotel cannot allow guests to stay longer than 30 days, per town code.

Before Orangetown’s legal action, Rockland County Executive Ed Day declared a state of emergency over the weekend in an effort to stop the asylum seekers.

Levy, in his Tuesday night statement, slammed Day over his resistance to the city’s migrant relocation plan.

“The Rockland County executive has already shown he is incapable of managing less than ¼ of 1% of the asylum seekers who have come to New York City, even with New York paying for shelter, food, and services, and all this temporary order shows is that he is incapable of demonstrating a shred of the humane and compassionate care New York City has shown over the past year,” said Levy.

Orange County Executive Steve Neuhaus issued a similar emergency declaration late Monday that would prohibit hotels, motels and other short-term rentals from allowing migrants to stay there.

Gotham has received tens of thousands of migrants that crossed over the southern border and then were bused to the Big Apple from Texas.

Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, has said repeatedly the city doesn’t have the resources to care for the thousands of newcomers and has pleaded with the federal government to provide robust assistance.",general,1

The department said in a release on Tuesday that it has approved 66 out of 101 materials that have been submitted for approval, and those materials are now available for sale to school districts. It said only 19 of the submitted materials were initially eligible for approval because the others contained “inaccurate material, errors and other information that was not aligned” with state law.

The release states that the department has worked directly with publishers to update their materials to comply with Florida’s “rigorous standards.”

“To uphold our exceptional standards, we must ensure our students and teachers have the highest quality materials available – materials that focus on historical facts and are free from inaccuracies or ideological rhetoric,” Commissioner Manny Diaz, Jr. said in the release.

The approval process for the updated textbooks comes as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) has made pushing against what he considers to be “wokeness” in the state’s education system one of his top initiatives as governor.

DeSantis signed what has become commonly known as the “Stop WOKE Act” last year to prohibit education in schools that could make students feel they have “personal responsibility” for past wrongdoings because of their race, sex or national origin.

The department’s website lists several examples of content that materials previously contained that caused them to be rejected for use in schools.

One example shows a paragraph that suggested parents or guardians talk to their children about why some citizens are choosing to “Take a Knee” during the national anthem to protest police brutality and racism was removed. The book was designed for grades kindergarten to fifth grade, and the passage was removed because it was considered “not age appropriate.”

Another change was made in a book for grades six through eight that discusses socialism and planned economies. The book previously stated that the goal of a socialist economy was to “keep things nice and even” and that they might “promote greater equality among people while still providing a fully functioning government-supervised economy.”

That section was changed to refer to that system as “planned economies,” stating that in these systems, “The central planning authority decides what goods and services to produce, in what quantities, and at what prices. These decisions may be based on the government’s priorities, not based on what consumers want or need.”

It also includes criticisms of this system.

In another instance, a mention of the Black Lives Matter movement and the 2020 murder of George Floyd was entirely removed in a book for grades six to eight for being considered “unsolicited topics.”

The state announced last year that numerous math textbooks would be banned for references to “prohibited topics” like critical race theory and “Social Emotional Learning.”",general,1

“I feel honored to be here today, I’m so grateful that everybody’s going to be able to watch it all together, and I just cannot wait, honestly,” Halle Bailey, who takes on the iconic role of Ariel in Disney’s live-action adaptation, told reporters on the red carpet.

To become a mermaid, Bailey went through three months of training and rehearsals ahead of shooting, though she admitted that the hardest part of that process “was just mentally and physically being away from my sister [Chloe Bailey], who’s my best friend. But other than that it was just a lot of strength training.”

Melissa McCarthy, who transforms into sea witch Ursula, also spoke to The Hollywood Reporter about that intensive rehearsal process, which involved five weeks of practicing with her tentacles.

Director Rob Marshall “had eight dancers around me, and each dancer had an 8-foot-long tentacle with suction cups, and they had them on poles, so as I would float across or go up into the air there were people with me doing my tentacles,” McCarthy explained. “I was like, ‘Are we going to do this every day?’ And he goes, ‘I want you to know the space you take up,’ he’s like, ‘I want you to know when someone comes in that you’re 20 feet high looking down.'”

“I have to say, getting to do that, especially when you’re filming in such a virtual world that you don’t always see, to have the tactical and practical for all of those weeks of rehearsal — we all talked about it, what a difference it made,” she continued. “We were like, ‘We really do know what the world looks and feels like.'”

In becoming the iconic villain, McCarthy has noted that she took inspiration from drag queens, joking on the carpet that it goes beyond The Little Mermaid to “all of my roles, I’ve been stealing from drag queens for years.”

“There’s something about Ursula, it’s that irreverent humor, it’s that bite, it’s her vulnerability, it’s her hurt, it’s how you cover, like, What is your armor? I think Ursula — it’s her makeup, it’s her stance, her posture, her acerbic wit,” the star said. “I think that’s what drag does so well, and I think we’ve been doing it since the beginning of time. So I certainly don’t want to stop now.”

McCarthy also weighed in on the decision to update both “Kiss the Girl” and her song “Poor Unfortunate Souls” to make them more appropriate for 2023, saying, “You can love something and realize it can need a little zhuzh or need to come into the modern world. I think it’s great, especially [since] we had the fella who wrote it and he was like, ‘Yeah, let’s do it.’ So if [original film composer] Alan Menken says it’s OK, it’s OK.”

Javier Bardem, who plays King Triton in the adaptation, teased that his and Bailey’s mermaid training was a bit different, as she was much more of a natural. “I’m a big guy, she’s a mermaid,” he joked. “When you see her moving on the set like she won’t need anything, any of that. Me, try to move this thing, it takes a lot of work and a lot of people.” He added that the real-life mermaid tail was only worn on occasion when learning the depth and distance between each other, “but most of the time no, I was wearing just some pants.”

Bardem also spoke about his relationship with Bailey on the film, as it focuses on the relationship of father and daughter and “his journey to understand that true love really is about letting the other person be free, to be on his own or her own. I think the movie goes deeper than the original in that. For me with Halle, it was instant; I met her and it was like, ‘There’s nothing we have to build, I adore you already,’ because she’s like an angel and I don’t want anything bad to happen to you. And she felt comfortable with me, and we just played the scenes.”

Jonah Hauer-King, who plays Ariel’s love interest, Prince Eric, had a similarly close relationship with Bailey, noting, “She was immediately one of my best friends. She looked after me the whole way through. She was kind, she was supportive.” Comparing it to the massive world premiere red carpet, he said, “It was the same on set. It was the full Disney works, so stepping onto a set like that was thrilling but quite intimidating as well, so she just looked out for me. She always held my hand, literally and metaphorically, and I was very grateful for her.”

65,Tidal Surprises: Researchers Unravel the Secret Behind Greenland's Ice Meltdown - SciTechDaily,https://scitechdaily.com/?p=275955,"Study suggests extent of future sea level rise could be vastly underestimated.

New research has found that the grounding line of Greenland’s Petermann Glacier shifts during tidal cycles, allowing warm seawater to accelerate ice melt. This previously unknown interaction could cause a 200% increase in sea level rise projections for ocean-ending glaciers if included in models.

While conducting a study of Petermann Glacier in northwest Greenland, researchers at the University of California, Irvine and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory uncovered a previously unseen way in which the ice and ocean interact. The glaciologists said their findings could mean that the climate community has been vastly underestimating the magnitude of future sea level rise caused by polar ice deterioration.

Using satellite radar data from three European missions, the UCI/NASA team learned that Petermann Glacier’s grounding line – where ice detaches from the land bed and begins floating in the ocean – shifts substantially during tidal cycles, allowing warm seawater to intrude and melt ice at an accelerated rate. The group’s results are the subject of a paper published on May 8 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

“Petermann’s grounding line could be more accurately described as a grounding zone, because it migrates between 2 and 6 kilometers as tides come in and out,” said lead author Enrico Ciraci, UCI assistant specialist in Earth system science and NASA postdoctoral fellow. “This is an order of magnitude larger than expected for grounding lines on a rigid bed.”

He said the traditional view of grounding lines beneath ocean-reaching glaciers was that they did not migrate during tidal cycles, nor did they experience ice melt. But the new study replaces that thinking with knowledge that warm ocean water intrudes beneath the ice through preexisting subglacial channels, with the highest melt rates occurring at the grounding zone.

The researchers found that as Petermann Glacier’s grounding line retreated nearly 4 kilometers – 2½ miles – between 2016 and 2022, warm water carved a 670-foot-tall cavity in the underside of the glacier, and that abscess remained there for all of 2022.

“These ice-ocean interactions make the glaciers more sensitive to ocean warming,” said senior co-author Eric Rignot, UCI professor of Earth system science and NASA JPL research scientist. “These dynamics are not included in models, and if we were to include them, it would increase projections of sea level rise by up to 200 percent – not just for Petermann but for all glaciers ending in the ocean, which is most of northern Greenland and all of Antarctica.”

The Greenland ice sheet has lost billions of tons of ice to the ocean in the past few decades, the PNAS paper stresses, with most of the loss caused by warming of subsurface ocean waters, a product of Earth’s changing climate. Exposure to ocean water melts the ice vigorously at the glacier front and erodes resistance to the movement of glaciers over the ground, causing the ice to slide more quickly to the sea, according to Rignot.

""It was warm. It definitely was warm. Again I just thought it was a random rock from outside,"" recalled Suzy Kop.

HOPEWELL TOWNSHIP, New Jersey (WPVI) -- A New Jersey family says they're still in shock after a possible meteorite smashed through a roof.

Christine Lloyd took Action News inside an upstairs bedroom of her father's Hopewell Township home along Old Washington Crossing Pennington Road.

""This is the point of entry. And then apparently it came through there and then it came and hit that floor,"" she explained.

But the mystery object wasn't done.

It appears to have ricocheted across the room, making another hole in the ceiling, before it came to rest on the floor.

It was a metallic object, about 4 inches by 6 inches that authorities are calling a possible meteorite, which is debris from a comet or asteroid in space.

The family says no one was inside the house at the time of impact.

Christine's sister, Suzy Kop, was the one who found the strange rock and picked it up.

""It was warm. It definitely was warm. Again I just thought it was a random rock from outside. Why would it be in the bedroom?"" said Kop.

Not knowing what else to do they called police, who called in other agencies to test the object for radiation.

Christine Lloyd took Action News inside an upstairs bedroom of her father's Hopewell Township home to show damage from a possible meteorite.

Once it was deemed safe, they reached out to an expert.

""I got a message from a colleague saying the Hopewell PD was going to call me. And I was like - why?"" laughed geophysicist Shannon Graham, PhD at The College of New Jersey.

She said that based on the photos and descriptions, the object seems consistent with a meteorite.

""He also described what it did to the house and I was like, 'Well that came in very quickly,'"" Graham said.

She says tests on the density and material would tell them more.

""We have a scanning electron microscope on campus,"" said Graham. ""It'll tell us the chemistry of it and that can tell us Earth-made metal or metal from space.""

Police say this could possibly be related to a weeks-long meteor shower called Eta Aquarids that is active right now.

The scientists we spoke with say if it is a meteorite, this is very rare, especially for something this big to come through the atmosphere.

The family says for now they're keeping the object in a safe and undisclosed location.",general,1
67,New AI can predict pancreatic cancer 3 years early: study - New York Post ,https://nypost.com/2023/05/09/new-ai-can-predict-pancreatic-cancer-3-years-early-study-says/,"Artificial intelligence may now be able to predict whether someone will get pancreatic cancer up to three years in advance, according to a new study.

Research suggests that an AI tool can detect who is at risk for the deadly disease — which is difficult to catch in its early stages — by using the patient’s medical records.

The study, which was published in the journal Nature Medicine this week, showed that potential cases of pancreatic cancer could be spotted by using an AI-based population screening.

Population screening is when medical professionals perform genetic testing or similar methods to look at the prevalence of a specific trait that’s found among a group of people, according to Nature.com.

It can help to identify a particular biomarker of certain diseases.

“One of the most important decisions clinicians face day to day is who is at high risk for a disease and who would benefit from further testing, which can also mean more invasive and more expensive procedures that carry their own risks,” said study supervisor Chris Sander, a Harvard Medical School professor, in a press release.

“An AI tool that can zero in on those at highest risk for pancreatic cancer who stand to benefit most from further tests could go a long way toward improving clinical decision-making.”

Artificial intelligence may be able to predict pancreatic cancer, according to a new study. Getty Images/iStockphoto

The study used data from millions of patients in Denmark and the US. Getty Images

The study was led by investigators at Harvard Medical School and the University of Copenhagen in collaboration with VA Boston Healthcare System, the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

In the study, researchers applied an AI algorithm to clinical data from 9 million patients from Denmark and the US.

They trained AI learning models to be able to read diagnosis codes in the patient’s data and connect them to pancreatic cancer.

The researchers tried out different versions of the AI models for potential diagnosis at different times — six months, one year, two years and three years — and found that their methods were “substantially more accurate at predicting who would develop pancreatic cancer than current population-wide estimates of disease incidence.”

The study was published in a journal called Nature Medicine. Getty Images/iStockphoto

However, the technology is still in its early stages and still needs to undergo many more tests.

Currently, pancreatic cancer is one of the most deadly cancers and is very hard to detect early, which is when it has the potential to be curable.

Often when people get a diagnosis, it’s too late, as the cancer in its early stages does not show up on imaging tests, according to the Cleveland Clinic.

There is only a 12.5% rate of five-year relative survival.

“Many types of cancer, especially those hard to identify and treat early, exert a disproportionate toll on patients, families and the health care system as a whole,” said study supervisor Søren Brunak, a professor of disease systems biology at the University of Copenhagen, in a press release.

“An AI tool that can zero in on those at highest risk for pancreatic cancer who stand to benefit most from further tests could go a long way toward improving clinical decision-making,” said study co-senior investigator Chris Sander. Getty Images/iStockphoto

“AI-based screening is an opportunity to alter the trajectory of pancreatic cancer, an aggressive disease that is notoriously hard to diagnose early and treat promptly when the chances for success are highest.”

Some symptoms of pancreatic cancer include jaundice, pain the middle of your back and upper abdomen, weight loss, itchy skin and fatigue.

This isn’t the first AI-based tool that could make a medical breakthrough.

In March, researchers out of Canada developed an artificial intelligence that they say could predict a patient’s survival rate for a cancer called hepatocellular carcinoma.

Another team of scientists in the US have developed an AI-powered blood test that could look for signs of lung cancer.",general,1
68,"Breast cancer screenings should start at age 40 instead of 50, US panel says - CNBC",https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/09/breast-cancer-screenings-should-start-at-age-40-us-panel-says-.html,"Most women should get screened for breast cancer every other year starting at age 40, a decade earlier than previously recommended, according to draft guidelines issued Tuesday by a government-backed panel of experts.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force said its new guidance could save 19% more lives.

Each year in the U.S., about 264,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed in women and roughly 2,400 in men, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 42,000 women and 500 men in the U.S. die each year from the disease.

Breast cancer screenings typically involve a mammogram, which is an X-ray of the breast.

The panel's guidance applies to cisgender women and all other people assigned female at birth who are at average risk of breast cancer. It does not apply to people at high risk of breast cancer, including those who have a family history of the disease.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force's recommendations are usually widely adopted in the U.S. The panel's previous guidance, which was last updated in 2016, suggested women should start screening every other year at age 50.

That guidance also said women in their 40s could talk to their doctors about getting screened, particularly if they have a family history of breast cancer.

At the time, the panel was concerned earlier screenings could lead to unnecessary treatment for younger women, including biopsies that turn out to be negative. A biopsy is a sample of tissue taken from the body, which gets tested for a disease like cancer.

But the panel said it changed that guidance due to ""new and more inclusive science"" about breast cancer in people younger than 50, according to Dr. Carol Mangione, immediate past chair of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.

The rate of breast cancer among women ages 40 to 49 increased 2% each year on average from 2015 to 2019, according to the National Cancer Institute.

The panel said the new guidance also aims to ease the disparities in breast cancer death rates between Black women and white women.

Black women are 40% more likely to die of the disease than their white counterparts and ""too often get deadly cancers at younger ages,"" the panel said in the guidelines.

The panel urgently called for more research on how to eliminate the disparity.

""Ensuring Black women start screening at age 40 is an important first step, yet it is not enough to improve the health inequities we face related to breast cancer,"" Dr. Wanda Nicholson, the panel's vice chair, said in the guidelines.

Other medical groups, including the American College of Radiology and the American Cancer Society, already recommend annual breast cancer screenings before age 50.

About 60% of women ages 40 to 49 reported having a mammogram within the past two years in 2019, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",general,1
69,Billerud paper mill in Escanaba to reopen after blastomycosis outbreak - Detroit Free Press,https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2023/05/09/billerud-paper-mill-escanaba-blastomycosis-outbreak/70199581007/,"After being closed for more than three weeks for deep cleaning and investigation of a mysterious blastomycosis fungal infection outbreak, the Billerud paper mill in Escanaba is back to full operation.

The Swedish-based company announced its reopening Monday on its website after the closing related to the blastomycosis outbreak, escanabamillinfo.com.

""To date, no Blastomyces spores have been found within the mill,"" company officials stated. ""The health and safety of our employees and contractors remains our top priority and we are focused on ensuring a safe return to the mill. We continue to work closely with and follow the recommendations of local, state, and federal health experts as they continue to investigate this dynamic situation.""

The resumption of production at the paper mill, Michigan's largest manufacturing employer north of Midland with more than 800 employees, comes as the local health department announced an increase of six blastomycosis cases over the past week, to a total of 115. At least 14 of those infected required hospitalization, with one, a contractor from Gladstone, dying from the disease last month. All of the cases are either employees, contractors or visitors to the Billerud Escanaba mill.

The uptick in cases does not necessarily mean Blastomyces exposures are ongoing, said Michael Snyder, health officer with Public Health Delta and Menominee Counties, in a statement.

""Due to the lengthy incubation time — the time from exposure to the fungus to the time one starts to show symptoms of blastomycosis — it is likely all cases had an exposure prior to the mill idling operations,"" he said. The incubation period varies from person to person, and can be three weeks to three months, he said.

The Billerud blastomycosis outbreak is the largest of its kind in an industrial setting in U.S. history. How it occurred is still a mystery, as the fungal disease is almost never spread from person to person. That could indicate that all of those infected were exposed to the same Blastomyces spore-containing materials at some point earlier this year. Workers began falling ill with the disease in February, and public health officials recognized it as an outbreak by early March.

In addition to the local health department, agencies investigating the outbreak include the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.

Billerud is making N95 protective masks available to employees as a precautionary measure.

According to the CDC, people contract blastomycosis after breathing in microscopic Blastomyces fungal spores from the air, often after participating in activities that disturb the soil. The spores can be found throughout the eastern U.S. and parts of Canada, including in Michigan's Upper Peninsula.

Once inside the lungs, the body's warmth and moisture can transform the spores into yeast that can stay in the lungs or be transferred through the bloodstream to other parts of the body, including the skin, bones, joints, organs, brain and spinal cord.

Some exposed to the spores will exhibit no symptoms. For others, symptoms of blastomycosis often mirror a cold or flu — cough, fever, body aches, night sweats. But for some, the disease can result in serious illness or death.

States that track blastomycosis report only about one or two cases per 100,000 population a year. Deaths from the disease are similarly rare, with the CDC finding 1,216 blastomycosis-related deaths occurred in the U.S. from 1990 to 2010, an average of about 61 per year nationwide.

""Blastomycosis is treatable with antifungal medicines, but it is important to get diagnosed early,"" Snyder said. Antifungal treatments may be necessary for six months to a year, depending on the severity of the infection and a person's immune status, he said.

In January, the Legislature and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer approved a $200 million state grant to help the Billerud Escanaba mill convert from producing magazine and catalog paper to paperboard like that used in consumer product boxes. The more than $1 billion retooling of the plant, which is expected to keep it one of the region's largest, best-paying employers for years to come, is slated for completion by 2029, according to Billerud's website.

70,Weird demon shark with bright white eyes discovered off Australia - Livescience.com,https://www.livescience.com/animals/sharks/weird-demon-shark-with-bright-white-eyes-discovered-off-australia,"The new species of catshark has shiny white irises, which is unusual of a deep-sea species.

A new species of deep-sea shark with bright white eyes has finally been identified, decades after a dead pregnant female of the species was first collected off the coast of Western Australia. The ""ghost"" shark was initially misidentified, and was only pegged as a new species after scientists took a second look at its bizarre egg cases that had languished in museum storage for years.

The newfound species, which was described in a new study published April 23 in the Journal of Fish Biology (opens in new tab), has been named Apristurus ovicorrugatus, which is derived from the Latin for egg, ""ovi,"" and ""corrugatus,"" meaning corrugated, in reference to the corrugated egg cases that led to the species' discovery.

The pregnant female, which was caught in 1992 and held in a museum collection, was carrying a single egg case. (Image credit: White et al/Journal of Fish Biology)

Along with its unique egg cases, A. ovicorrugatus also possesses unusual, shiny white irises.

""This is not a common feature for a deepwater species and only one other species, Apristurus nakayai from New Caledonia and PNG [Papua New Guinea] shares this character,"" study lead author Will White (opens in new tab), an ichthyologist with Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), told Live Science in an email.

Apristurus is a genus of catshark. They are commonly known as ghost or demon catsharks (opens in new tab). It is one of the most diverse shark genera in the world, with around 40 known species.

While the majority of shark species give birth to live young, the rest are oviparous, meaning they lay eggs. The egg cases — also known as mermaid's purses — often have long tendrils that allow them to attach to seaweed or rocks.

In 2011, researchers came across an extremely strange egg case (opens in new tab) containing a shark embryo. It was clear the shark belonged to the Apristurus genus, but the egg case did not match any known species.

For over a decade, the egg case remained a mystery, until scientists found two more sitting in the Australian National Fish Collection, which falls under the CSIRO umbrella.

""The egg cases possessed very distinctive longitudinal ridges on their surfaces which were T-shaped in cross-section,"" White said. ""Only one other species in the world has been found to have egg cases with that form of ridging and that is a different genus entirely.""

A late-term embryo was found inside one of the egg cases examined. (Image credit: White et al/Journal of Fish Biology)

White and his colleagues then trawled through their collection database to see if any other unidentified Apristurus specimens had been found in the small region where the egg cases had been collected. They eventually found the pregnant female: a 1.5 foot-long (46.7 centimeters) shark that had been misidentified as a South China catshark (Apristurus sinensis).

The female was carrying a single egg case — and it matched the one they'd found a decade ago.

""Luckily the female specimen we found contained an identically ridged egg case and confirmed our suspicions,"" White said.

Researchers say the discovery of A. ovicorrugatus highlights the importance of egg case shape to identifying species. In Australia, members of the public are invited to upload images of egg cases to a global database (opens in new tab), allowing scientists to better understand where egg-laying sharks are breeding. The A. ovicorrugatus egg cases were found attached to corals, suggesting the species may rely on these organisms for reproduction.

Going forward, White and colleagues are scouring museum collections for more new species to see what else curators have overlooked or misidentified.",general,1

REUTERS/Aly Song















OTTAWA, May 9 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday said Canada will not be intimidated by China following tit-for-tat diplomatic expulsions by Ottawa and Beijing.

Ottawa expelled Chinese diplomat Zhao Wei on Monday over allegations related to foreign interference, and hours later, China asked a Canadian diplomat in Shanghai to leave by May 13 in response to what it called Ottawa's ""unreasonable actions"".

""We understand there is retaliation, but we will not be intimidated, we will continue to do everything necessary to keep Canadians protected from foreign interference,"" Trudeau told reporters in Ottawa.

A row has simmered since the detention of Huawei Technologies executive Meng Wanzhou in 2018 and Beijing's subsequent arrest of two Canadians on spying charges. All three were freed in 2021.

Some fear the latest flare-up could have economic repercussions for Canada. Chinese imports of Canadian goods rose 16% last year to a record of C$100 billion ($74.8 billion), and China is Canada's second-biggest trading partner after the United States.

Last year, Beijing lifted a three-year ban on imports of canola, Canada's largest crop, from trading companies Richardson International and Viterra that had been imposed in 2018. China is also a major importer of Canadian potash and wheat.

""With China, there’s always a risk"" of retaliation, said Tyler McCann, managing director of the Canadian Agri-Food Policy Institute. ""(But) it seems the Chinese government is more sensitive about food security than they were years ago and that might mitigate the risk.""

Global supplies of wheat and vegetable oil are in tighter supply due to the Ukraine war, which may make it difficult for China to limit its imports of Canadian wheat and canola.

China ""took a very measured response,"" Guy Saint-Jacques, a former Canadian ambassador to China, said in an interview aired on the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. He said the Chinese could have responded by expelling a more senior official or multiple officials.

Saint-Jacques also said he does not expect China to resort to economic sanctions because Beijing is trying to reassure foreign companies that they can work there after draconian COVID-19 restrictions were dropped.

Beijing has this year rolled out the red carpet for Western leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron, and China's Premier Li Qiang has reached out to corporate leaders to ensure them the country is now open for business.

Beijing is conducting a ""charm offensive (to) convince foreign enterprises to come back to China to invest,"" Saint-Jacques added. ""So putting sanctions on Canada at this stage would have sent a very bad message to foreign companies.""

74,Protests erupt in Pakistan cities after Imran Khan arrest - Al Jazeera English,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/9/protests-erupt-in-pakistan-cities-after-imran-khan-arrest,"Thousands take to the streets in the capital Islamabad, Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar and other cities.

Police have fired water cannon and tear gas to quell protests that erupted in several cities across Pakistan hours after former Prime Minister Imran Khan was arrested in connection with a corruption case.

Thousands of Khan’s supporters took to the streets on Tuesday in the capital Islamabad, Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar and other cities to protest against his arrest.

At least one worker for Khan’s party was killed in Quetta, Shireen Mazari, former minister and senior leader of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party told media.

In Islamabad, hundreds of PTI activists blocked the main Kashmir Highway, which suspended traffic on either side of the road.

Reporting from Islamabad, Al Jazeera’s Kamal Hyder said “a precarious situation” is developing following Khan’s arrest.

“As the reports of Imran Khan’s arrest went across the country, protesters [took] to the streets and arrests are being made,” Hyder said. “There is considerable anger as far as Imran Khan’s supporters are concerned and the situation is escalating by the hour.”

Hyder added that officials anticipated the protests and have warned the public against participating in them.

“The inspector general of Islamabad police has said that anybody coming out to protest should be arrested,” he said.

Local broadcaster Geo News reported that police have arrested over a dozen of PTI workers after the two sides clashed at several points in the city.

“We will block the entire country and protest until Khan is released,” Waseem Qayyum, a protester, told dpa news agency.

In Lahore, the country’s second-largest city, protesters gathered outside the former prime minister’s Zaman Park residence and blocked the adjacent roads by burning tyres. Police used water cannon to disperse the protesters.

In the southern port city of Karachi, PTI supporters gathered outside the local party office located along the city’s busiest Shahrah-e-Faisal Road. Both tracks of the road near the PTI office were closed to traffic as heavy contingents of police cordoned off the area.

Police also hurled tear gas canisters to disperse the protesters when they tried to block the road.

A group of protesters pelted stones and burned tyres at Burns Road, the city’s famous food street, suspending traffic and forcing shopkeepers to pull their shutters downs.

In northwestern Landi Kotal town, which borders neighbouring Afghanistan, protesters blocked the Pak-Afghan highway at two points, Dawn News reported.





Khan’s arrest followed months of political crisis and came hours after the country’s powerful military rebuked the former international cricketer for alleging a senior officer had been involved in a plot to kill him.

“Imran Khan has been arrested in the Qadir Trust case,” the official Islamabad police Twitter account said, referring to a corruption case.

Video broadcast on local TV channels showed Khan – who has a pronounced limp since being shot during an assassination attempt last year – being manhandled by dozens of paramilitary rangers into an armoured car inside the Islamabad High Court premises.

It was not immediately clear where he was taken.

Anticipating his arrest, party officials later released a pre-recorded video by Khan in which he urged supporters to come out in support of “true freedom”.

“My Pakistanis, by the time these words reach you, I would have been detained under an illegitimate case,” he says in the video.

“One thing should become clear for all of you from this is that fundamental rights in Pakistan, the rights given to us by our constitution and democracy, have been buried.”

Pakistan is deeply mired in an economic and political crisis, with Khan pressuring the struggling coalition government for early elections.",general,1

76,Meritus doctor expects RSV vaccine in Hagerstown by end of month - Herald-Mail Media,https://www.heraldmailmedia.com/story/news/local/2023/05/08/meritus-doctor-expects-rsv-vaccine-in-hagerstown-md-by-end-of-month/70184447007/,"Many people don't know about respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV.

And in many ways, that makes sense.

It largely goes unnoticed because in most cases, it results in a common cold, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

But Anand Budi, a longtime pediatrician and chief medical officer for Meritus Health, is seeing worrisome trends with the virus.

Budi said he's diagnosing more cases of RSV locally, and people are getting sicker from it, and their hospitalizations to treat it are getting longer.

Now he said last week that the health care profession is starting to breathe a sigh of relief since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday approved the first vaccine for RSV.

How long has the virus been around?

It's been a long time coming because the virus was first discovered in 1956. Hope for a vaccine started to ramp up in the 1980s when a greater understanding of the virus began to unfold. Last year, excitement began to build over a possible vaccine when six drug companies reported they were working on RSV vaccines or antibodies, according to Budi and other health professionals.

The vaccine approved by the FDA on Wednesday is Arexvy, which will be used to protect adults 60 years old and up, one of two segments of the population most susceptible to the virus. The other population is infants and younger children.

Outbreaks of respiratory illnesses caused by RSV typically start in the fall and peak in the winter, although the timing and severity of them can vary, according to the CDC.

In older adults, RSV causes more than 177,000 hospitalizations a year and approximately 14,000 deaths.

When will the vaccine arrive in Washington County?

Budi said he expects the first shipments of the Arexvy vaccine to arrive in Washington County pharmacies and physician's offices later this month.

He said a vaccine for children is still being developed, a process that is often ""secretly guarded.""

There is not a concern about developing a vaccination for middle-aged people because health care professionals believe that targeting the two most susceptible populations will be the most effective way to control the virus, Budi said.

The need for a childhood RSV vaccine is illustrated by the large numbers of kids becoming ill from the virus.

Recently, there have been waiting lists up to ""70 kids at a time"" to get children proper treatment in hospitals, Budi said. And last October and November, Meritus Medical Center near Hagerstown was transferring infected children to hospitals in cities like Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and Morgantown, W.Va., because it was running out of the facilities it needed.

""It's starting to become a lot more of a problem in the last decade,"" Budi said.

78,Galactic Mistake? Astronomers May Have Solved the Mystery of the Runaway Supermassive Black Hole - SciTechDaily,https://scitechdaily.com/galactic-mistake-astronomers-may-have-solved-the-mystery-of-the-runaway-supermassive-black-hole/,"A study carried out by a team of researchers at the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias (IAC) has shown that an unusually thin structure of stars, recently discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope, could be a galaxy seen edge-on. This finding goes against the original interpretation in which a fleeing supermassive black hole was leaving a trail of stars in its wake. The new interpretation is published in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics Letters.

A mysterious trail of stars formed eight thousand million years ago and recently discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope has been a challenge to a number of research groups. Its size is similar to that of the Milky Way, and this very long narrow structure has given rise to several explanations of its origin.

According to a controversial initial hypothesis, this trail of stars could be the result of the passage of a supermassive black hole through a huge cloud of gas. This idea quickly fired the imagination of the astronomical community, because it needs a large set of complex exceptional circumstances. For this reason, several scientific teams have continued to explore different, and less exotic scenarios which can explain the observations.

In a recent study, researchers at the IAC have reached the conclusion that this unusual structure of stars could be interpreted as a galaxy without a bulge seen edge-on. This type of galaxies, also called thin, or flat galaxies, are relatively common. “The motions, the size, and the quantity of stars fits what has been seen in galaxies within the local universe” explains Jorge Sanchez Almeida, an IAC researcher who is the first author of the article. “It’s a relief to have found the solution to this mystery, the new proposed scenario is much simpler. In one sense it is also a pity, because the existence of fleeing black holes is expected, and this could have been the first one to be observed.”

To support the hypothesis of the interpretation in terms of a galaxy, the team compared the mysterious structure with a well-known local galaxy without a bulge, IC5249, which has a similar mass of stars, and found surprising agreement. In the words of Mireia Montes, an IAC researcher who is a co-author of the article, “When we analyzed the velocities of this distant structure of stars we realized that they were very similar to those obtained from the rotation of galaxies, so we decided to compare a much closer galaxy, and found that they are extraordinarily similar.”

“We also looked at the relation between the mass of the assumed galaxy and its máximum velocity of rotation, and discovered that indeed it is a galaxy which behaves like a galaxy,” states Ignacio Trujillo, an IAC researcher who has taken part in the study. “It is an interesting object, because it is quite a large galaxy at a very large distance from Earth, where the majority of the galaxies are smaller,” he adds.

Upcoming observations will allow the study of this object in greater detail.

79,Aerospace Corp. CEO predicts swarm of AI-controlled ‘hyper-intelligence satellites’: ‘Almost like Hal 9000’ - Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/media/aerospace-corp-ceo-predicts-swarm-ai-controlled-hyper-intelligence-satellites-hal-9000,"The Aerospace Corporation President and CEO Steve Isakowitz said he anticipates the future of space exploration and defense will include AI-controlled satellites and permanent living on the surface of the Moon and Mars.

Speaking with Fox News Digital at the Milken Global Conference on May 4, Isakowitz noted that NASA has been using artificial intelligence (AI) for many years in Mars rovers because of the time it takes to communicate back and forth with Earth. The rover needed to know where to go and how to do so safely to combat the delay. Today, with the expansion in capabilities of AI and smaller, more affordable computer chips, advanced AI tech can now be packed into the satellites orbiting Earth.

""I do think we're entering an age where we're going to have hyper-intelligence satellites, satellites that will not just be dumb cameras that are looking at the Earth and just filming everything, but you could tell it what to look for. So, don't just take pictures of the Pacific Ocean. Look for these kinds of tankers or look for these kinds of ships or look for these kind of warships or these kind of airplanes where you actually have the satellite. Know what it's looking at that has the intelligence to know if it doesn't feel well,"" Isakowitz said. ""Almost like Hale 9000 from the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey.""

AI: IT'S ALREADY '2001' IN SPACE EXPLORATION AS SCIENTISTS UNRAVEL MYSTERIES OF DEEP SPACE

These satellites, according to Isakowitz, could tell people when a piece of its infrastructure is breaking down or talk to swarms of satellites that could act as a ""cluster"" to complete a mission. Isakowitz said giving satellites autonomous capabilities is essential when there are thousands of satellites, with the potential to crash into each other, being put up every year. In 2018, 2,027 active satellites were orbiting the Earth. In 2022, that number rose to 6,905, according to Statista data.

Isakowitz also noted that the goals of today's space programs are much different than decades prior. While the early days of NASA and other space-related ventures were focused on the ""cutting edge of the frontier"" and being first, today will involve many more players in space, not only in the U.S. government and commercial but also international groups. Isakowitz referred to this new era as ""the opening of the frontier of space,"" a time when the cost of getting to space has dropped dramatically and the capabilities of satellites have gone way up.

""Some people don't realize that we are going back to the Moon. But unlike the Apollo program, we're going back to stay,"" Isakowitz said. ""We're looking to actually establish permanent capabilities. And we're not just going to the Moon to see what the Moon looks like. We're actually going to the parts of the Moon, particularly the South Pole, where we actually think there's water resources. With water resources, it would be able to sustain life, potentially create the kind of rocket fuel that could sustain a significant activity on the Moon and would also provide the groundwork that would allow us to learn of how to get to Mars.""

Isakowitz predicted that within the next 15–20 years we will see the first individuals stepping foot and learning to live on the surface of Mars.

NASA AI MODEL COULD HELP WORLD PREPARE FOR IMPACT OF SOLAR STORMS

Isakowitz also predicted that with this rapid technological acceleration, the cost of space flight for the average citizen could drop significantly. He compared space flight to any new technology, such as a cell phone or a computer. As demand grows, the price slowly begins to drop.

""It's true today that if you want to go into orbit in space, it's millions of dollars. If you want to go to the edge of space for a few minutes. It's hundreds of thousands of dollars. But if you're trying to get it down to tens of thousands, singles of thousands, it's going to take time. I think as demand grows and people feel just like flying on an airplane, that it's safe to do it, and it becomes affordable,"" Isakowitz said.

CURIOSITY MARS ROVER FINDS THE 'BEST EVIDENCE' OF ANCIENT WATER IN RIPPLED ROCKS

But while the future of space flight and exploration is filled with promise, the present has also included some monumental achievements. In September 2022, it was revealed that NASA successfully altered the orbit of an asteroid for the first time in history, crashing a spacecraft into the asteroid Dimorphos as part of the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART).

""You know, the old joke, do you know why the dinosaurs went extinct? Because they didn't have a space program? Well, on a more serious note is because today we can observe it, those asteroids, we can actually move those asteroids,"" Isakowitz said. ""We can mine those asteroids and actually take the mineral wealth from those asteroids to get some of the rare earth materials that we need. This is some really exciting, almost sound sci-fi kind of activity that's going on today.""",science,1
81,Geoscientists Unearth New Insights Into Life's Evolution 800 Million Years Ago - SciTechDaily,https://scitechdaily.com/geoscientists-unearth-new-insights-into-lifes-evolution-800-million-years-ago/,"Although the oceans from ancient times have disappeared, the events that occurred in them have been recorded in rocks. By examining these rocks, we can connect Earth’s past to its present and future, gaining a deeper understanding of our planet’s history.

Could nitrate be responsible for algae, flowers, and even your neighbors? A group of geoscientists from Virginia Tech has uncovered evidence that suggests the answer may be yes.

Recently published in Science Advances, the team’s research findings show a rise in biologically accessible nitrogen during the period when marine eukaryotes – organisms with a defined nucleus – gained dominance. The evolution of complex eukaryotic cells into multicellular beings marked a significant turning point in the history of life on Earth, leading to the emergence of animals, plants, and fungi.

“Where we sit today, with life as it is on the planet, is the sum total of all the events that happened in the past,” said Ben Gill, an associate professor of sedimentary geochemistry and co-author on the paper. “And this is a key event where we shift from dominantly prokaryotic ecosystems — cells that are much simpler than the ones in our bodies — to eukaryotes. If that did not happen, we would not be here today.”

Previous research focused on phosphorus’ role in the rise of eukaryotes, but Junyao Kang, a doctoral student in the Department of Geosciences and lead author of the paper, was curious about the part nitrogen played in this event.

“This data is unique because nitrogen isotope data are virtually nonexistent from the early Neoproterozoic time period, or between a billion and 800 million years ago,” said Kang.

Collaborating with the Nanjing University in Nanjing, China, Kang has spent two years working to understand what drove the rise of eukaryotes through nitrogen isotope analysis of rock samples from the North China Craton. Home to rocks dating back 3.8 billion years ago, the region was once covered by an ocean.

“We had some rough ideas of when eukaryotes became ecologically successful,” said Shuhai Xiao, professor of geobiology and a paper co-author. “They had been there for a long time in a low-key status until about 820 million years ago, when they became abundant.”

Kang decided he wanted to learn why. He took the data from the rock samples, entered it into a larger database, and analyzed it across a longer time scale that spanned different geographic locations.

“Once we did this kind of integration and put it into a big picture, we saw the rise of nitrates through time, which happened around 800 million years ago,” said Kang.

Solid collaboration

A collaborative, international approach was key to connecting this new data with biological events, most notably, the rise of eukaryotes.

Gill and Rachel Reid, also a College of Science geochemist and co-author of the paper, provided critical analyses through resources, including the mass spectrometer in the Geoscience Stable Isotope Lab at Virginia Tech. An elemental analyzer coupled to the mass spectrometer allowed the researchers to extract pure nitrogen gas from the samples for analysis.

Gill specializes in reconstructing present and past chemical cycles on our planet. He collaborates with paleontologists to study the record of life preserved in the geological record and examines what potential environmental drivers might have enabled changes in life throughout history.

Reid, who generally focuses her research on Earth’s more recent events, had a special opportunity to offer her nitrogen isotope expertise to these ancient fossils.

Feifei Zhang, a geochemist at Nanjing University, was the paper’s fourth co-author. Zhang provided insights into how much oxygen would have been available in the oceans during the time when nitrate increased in abundance.

All of the Virginia Tech authors are affiliated members of the Fralin Life Sciences Institute’s Global Change Center, with Kang serving as a Ph.D. fellow in the Interfaces of Global Change graduate program. The center brings together experts from diverse disciplines to solve these complex global challenges and train the next generation of leaders.

Past, present, and future

Xiao, who has helped excavate and study some of the most ancient fossils from around the world, said this type of study gives him hope for future discoveries. The team members look forward to collaborating with NASA on future grants, such as the exobiology program supporting their current research.

He also credits University Libraries at Virginia Tech for its support of open-access publications, such as Science Advances, to provide a vetted selection of research, freely available to readers.

“We can link the dots from the nitrogen isotopic compositions in the ancient past and then go to the next step and infer how much nitrate was available for organisms,” said Xiao. “And then we tie that with the fossil data to show that there’s a relationship.”

While ancient oceans are long gone, what happened in ancient oceans is recorded in rocks, and studying these rocks provides a link from our Earth’s history to the present and to the future.

“Geologists look at rocks for the same reason that stock traders look at the Dow Jones curve when they make decisions to sell or buy stocks. The geological history written in rocks gives us important context about global changes in the future,” said Xiao.

85,Scientists discover secret 'symmetries' that protect Earth from the chaos of space - Livescience.com,https://www.livescience.com/space/cosmology/scientists-discover-secret-symmetries-that-protect-earth-from-the-chaos-of-space,"The inner solar system should be a chaotic mess, according to physical models. New research could explain its relative stability.

Earth probably shouldn't exist.

That's because the orbits of the inner solar system planets — Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars — are chaotic, and models have suggested that these inner planets should have crashed into each other by now. And yet, that hasn't happened.

New research published May 3 in the journal Physical Review X (opens in new tab) may finally explain why.

Through a deep plunge into the models for planetary motion , the researchers discovered that the motions of the inner planets are constrained by certain parameters that act as a tether that inhibits the system's chaos. Besides providing a mathematical explanation for the apparent harmony in our solar system, the new study's insights may help scientists understand the trajectories of exoplanets surrounding other stars.

Unpredictable planets

Planets constantly exert a mutual gravitational pull on each other – and these little tugs constantly make minor adjustments to the planets' orbits. The outer planets, which are much larger, are more resistant to little tugs and so maintain comparatively stable orbits.

The problem of inner planet trajectories, however, is still too complicated to solve exactly. In the late 19th century, mathematician Henri Poincaré proved that it is mathematically impossible to solve the equations governing the motion for three or more interacting objects, often known as the "" three body problem ."" As a result, uncertainties in the details of the planets' starting positions and velocities balloon over time. In other words: It is possible to take two scenarios in which the distances between Mercury, Venus, Mars and Earth differ by the slightest amount, and in one the planets smash into each other and in another they veer apart.

An illustration of two rocky planets colliding (Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech)

The time it takes for two trajectories with almost identical starting conditions to diverge by a specific amount is known as the Lyapunov time of the chaotic system. In 1989, Jacques Laskar (opens in new tab), astronomer and research director at the National Center for Scientific Research and Paris Observatory and a co-author of the new study, calculated the characteristic Lyapunov time (opens in new tab)for the planetary orbits of the inner solar system was just 5 million years.

""It means basically that you lose one digit every 10 million years,"" Laskar, told Live Science. So, for example if the initial uncertainty in the position of a planet is 15 meters, 10 million years later this uncertainty would be 150 meters; after 100 million years, a further 9 digits are lost, giving an uncertainty of 150 million kilometers, equivalent to the distance between Earth and the sun. ""Basically you have no idea where the planet is,"" said Laskar.

While 100 million years may seem long, the solar system itself is over 4.5 billion years old, and the lack of dramatic events — such as a planetary collision or a planet being ejected from all this chaotic motion — long puzzled scientists.

Laskar then looked at the problem in a different way: by simulating the inner planet trajectories over the next 5 billion years, stepping from one moment to the next. He found just a 1% chance of a planetary collision. With the same approach, he calculated that it would take, on average, about 30 billion years for any of the planets to collide.

Reining in the chaos

Delving through the math, Laskar and his colleagues then identified for the first time ""symmetries"" or ""conserved quantities"" in the gravitational interactions that create a ""practical barrier in the chaotic wandering of the planets,"" Laskar said.

These emergent quantities remain nearly constant and inhibit certain chaotic motions, but don't prevent them altogether, much like the raised lip of a dinner plate will inhibit food falling off the plate but not prevent it completely. We can thank these quantities for our solar system's apparent stability.

Renu Malhotra (opens in new tab), Professor of Planetary Sciences at the University of Arizona who was not involved in the study, highlighted how subtle the mechanisms identified in the study are. Malhotra told Live Science that it is interesting that ""our solar system's planetary orbits exhibit exceptionally weak chaos.""

In other work, Laskar and colleagues are searching for clues as to whether the number of planets in the solar system ever differed from what we currently see. For all the stability evident today, whether that has always been the case over the billions of years before life evolved remains an open question.",science,1
86,What time is it on the moon? How a lunar clock debate led to an out-of-this-world timepiece - Space.com,https://www.space.com/moon-time-lunar-clock-debate-wristwatch,"What time is it on the moon? As it turns out, that question is more difficult to answer than it would seem.

Back in November, a gathering of members from space organizations around the world met in the Netherlands and agreed that there is going to be a need to implement a proper lunar time zone — an internationally accepted common lunar reference time that all future missions can use to communicate and navigate with ease. ""A new era of lunar exploration is on the rise, with dozens of moon missions planned for the coming decade,"" said Jörg Hahn, an advisor from the European Space Agency (ESA) for the lunar timekeeping project. To allow these lunar missions to coordinate and communicate with each other, Hahn stated that the moon ""needs a shared clock"" and a ""common timing system.""

Currently, the moon does not have an independent timekeeping system. Instead, previous missions to the moon used their time zone from Earth, ESA officials said. Astronauts would be synchronized with Houston, Moscow or whatever time zone in which the mission headquarters was located. But with more lunar missions on the horizon from space agencies around the world, ESA said, that system won't work.

While a standardized timekeeping system and, by extension, navigation system have been established for Earth, the same should be done for the moon.

Related: Does the moon need its own time zone? We may need to decide soon

Everything old is new again

But this topic is not new at all and in fact, was first considered by a well-known and highly regarded American astronomer more than half a century ago!

Moreover, not only did this astronomer devise a methodology for telling time on the moon, but using his calculations, a then well-known watch company actually developed a wristwatch that could actually provide at a glance the precise time on the moon.

The astronomer in question was Dr. Kenneth L. Franklin (1923-2007), who served as the chief scientist at New York's Hayden Planetarium from 1956 to 1984 and was co-credited with discovering radio emissions originating on Jupiter — the first detection of signals from another planet. He was often a local and national media figure, publishing many technical papers, as well as serving as a consultant for Scientific American, New York Times, NBC and CBS as well as writing astronomy articles for World Book Encyclopedia.

In 1970, during the high point of America's Apollo lunar landing program, Dr. Franklin developed a special formula for telling time on the moon. At a news conference at the Overseas Press Club in New York in April of that year, Dr. Franklin announced that:

""In the not-too distant future, we will have reasonably permanent bases on the moon and the men who man these bases will want a time system that corresponds to the position of the sun where they are. Therefore, we need a time system based on the rotation of the moon.""

It sounds amazingly like what had been proposed by current-day space organizers last fall.

Kenneth Franklin in 1969. (Image credit: Public domain)

Of course, Dr. Franklin's 1970 prediction fell far short of reality. The last crewed lunar mission was in December 1972 and the ""reasonably permanent bases on the moon"" have yet to appear. But perhaps — if current space scientists are correct — those lunar bases will at long last materialize, to use Dr. Franklin's words, ""in the not-to-distant future.""

But what about the wristwatch?

A unique timepiece!

Helbros Watches Inc., was founded in 1913. The company, located at 2 Park Avenue in New York, was at its height in the 1950s but appears to have gradually declined after the death of its founder William Helbein in 1960. It was effectively closed by the mid-1970s.

But perhaps with such high interest in the Apollo moon program as the decade of the 1960s drew to a close, Helbros hit upon a concept that could have possibly increased enthusiasm and popularity for its company. It was at that same April 1970 news conference that a prototype of a lunar wristwatch was displayed, devised by the technical director at Helbros, Ross C. Kaskel, implementing Dr. Franklin's mathematical computations.

The moon watch that was unveiled was quite unlike the watches that people here on Earth rely upon, mainly due to the fact that it was based on the lunar synodic month or lunation. As the moon orbits the Earth, it is also revolving upon its axis. A complete rotation takes exactly the same time as one revolution — an average of 29.530589 days here on Earth.

Read more: Does the moon rotate?

Dr. Franklin then divided the lunation into 30 equal parts which he called ""lunes,"" each of which is almost as long as one Earth day. Each lune was subsequently divided into 24 ""lunours"" or lune-hours, lasting close to one Earth-hour in length. But in place of minutes and seconds, the decimal system was used to divide a lunour into 100 ""centilunours"" each of which consisted of 10 ""millilunours.""

The Helbros lunar wristwatch,whose face is divided into 24 ""lunours"" and 100 ""centilunours."" (Image credit: Public domain)

So, while a first glance, the face of the Helbros moon watch seemed to resemble a regular wristwatch, upon closer inspection the watch actually gave the time in lunours, centilunours and millilunours.

And while a standard calendar watch for Earth use would typically display the day of the month in a window on the right side of the watch face, on the moon watch the number of lunes would be shown instead. According to the system developed by Dr. Franklin, new moon corresponds to zero lune. A first quarter moon occurs at 7 lunes, 12 lunours. A full moon comes at 15 lunes and a last quarter moon coincided with 22 lunes, 12 lunours.

In order to compensate for the shorter time scale of a lunar synodic month versus a month measured on Earth, the hands of the Helbros battery-operated electric watch rotated roughly 1.6 percent faster compared to the hands of an Earth watch.

He proposed it first!

And to demonstrate that Dr. Franklin was a man far ahead of his time, he came to the same conclusion in 1970 that the space scientists in the Netherlands arrived at last November:

""The lunar time indicated on our Helbros watch may be called 'lunar mean solar time,' or Lunar Time (L.T.) in comparison to 'Universal Time' (U.T.), as the time at Greenwich is known to English-speaking astronomers. L.T. has been calculated for the Zero meridian on the moon, running through Sinus Medii, according to the lunar coordinate system adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 1961. We thus propose that the moon be subdivided into local lunar time zones similar to the Standard Time Zones here on Earth. These will be based on 12° meridians centered on the zero meridian. They will be named unambiguously as 36° East Zone time, etc. although 'Copernican time,' 'West Tranquility time,"" and others may be adopted as convenient.""

Final thoughts

After the lunar wristwatch was introduced, there was indeed a flurry of interest in it as Helbros had hoped. In fact, it was announced that four times each day, the correct ""moon time"" would be broadcast nationwide on 549 radio affiliates of the American Broadcasting Company. For many years on the second floor of the Hayden Planetarium was a glass case in which a moon watch (presumably the prototype) was displayed next to a letter of thanks to Dr. Franklin from then-President Richard Nixon; Helbros apparently had arranged to have the 37th President gifted with his own moon watch. In his letter, Mr. Nixon never asked Dr. Franklin why he was presented with a wristwatch that he could only use on the moon.

In time, interest in the watch faded, and with it, so did Helbros. Actually, the company seems to have either bought, or been bought, by Elgin Industries in the late 1960's, then become a stand-alone company again in the early 1970's. But sometime around 1974, they went into a temporary state of suspension, and the trademark was later acquired by Jules Jurgensen, then one of the greatest of vintage watch brands. But they too have since ceased operation with timepieces no longer in production.

It is not known just how many lunar wristwatches were manufactured and distributed by Helbros; unfortunately, the unique timepiece was possibly looked upon more as a novelty as opposed to a useful scientific device. I'm sure today, however, that any of the scientists who participated in last November's meeting in the Netherlands to ponder lunar timekeeping would be most interested in examining it.

Sadly, the whereabouts of the prototype is unknown.

And toward the end of his obituary, which appeared in the June 21, 2007 edition of the New York Times, it was noted that in 1970, Dr. Franklin ""... invented a watch for moonwalkers that measures time in what he called 'lunations,' the period it takes the moon to rotate and revolve around the Earth.""

""The watch has not yet become a big seller,"" the obituary added.",science,1
87,Gravity on the Moon: A comparative analysis with Earths gravitational pull - The News International,https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/1068711-why-do-astronauts-bounce-on-moon,"This picture released on April 28, 2023, shows the lunar surface. — Nasa

When we observe astronauts moving on the moon's surface, their movements appear bouncier and lighter than what we experience on Earth. This difference in movement can be attributed to the influence of gravity. Let's explore the moon's gravitational field, address intriguing questions about our nearby satellite, and delve into its composition.

One of the common questions that arise is whether the moon has gravity. The answer is yes, the moon does possess gravity. According to NASA, the moon's surface gravity measures approximately 1.62 meters per second squared, which is significantly lower than Earth's surface gravity of approximately 9.8 meters per second squared. The disparity in surface gravity explains why astronauts seem to move with greater buoyancy on the moon. Weight is directly influenced by gravity, so in an environment with weaker gravitational pull, individuals experience reduced weight.

However, it is essential to note that the moon's gravitational field is not uniform throughout. NASA's Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission discovered irregularities known as ""Bouguer"" gravity anomalies. These anomalies result from variations in crustal thickness or density of the crust or mantle. As a result, certain areas on the moon exhibit stronger gravity, while others possess weaker gravitational forces.

Despite misconceptions, the moon is not classified as a planet. Instead, it is Earth's only natural satellite. It orbits around our planet in an elliptical path. In our solar system, the moon is the fifth largest among over 200 known moons, as stated by NASA. Its role as Earth's satellite contributes to various phenomena, including tidal effects.

Regarding the moon's composition, the whimsical saying that the moon is made of green cheese is far from accurate. Instead, the moon is composed of various minerals. It consists of three distinct layers: the core, mantle, and crust. According to NASA, the moon's core is described as ""iron-rich."" The mantle, on the other hand, is believed to be primarily composed of minerals like olivine and pyroxene, which consist of magnesium, iron, silicon, and oxygen atoms. The moon's crust contains a mixture of elements such as oxygen, silicon, magnesium, iron, calcium, and aluminum, along with trace amounts of titanium, uranium, thorium, potassium, and hydrogen.

Understanding the dynamics of gravity on the moon provides valuable insights into the behavior of objects and the movements of astronauts in this unique environment. It allows us to comprehend the differences in weight and mobility experienced by individuals on the lunar surface. Additionally, studying the moon's composition enhances our understanding of its structure and provides comparative knowledge between the moon, Earth, and other celestial bodies.

In conclusion, the moon does have gravity, although its gravitational force is significantly weaker compared to Earth. The moon's surface gravity creates an environment where astronauts appear to move with greater ease and buoyancy. However, the moon's gravitational field is not consistent throughout, as evidenced by Bouguer gravity anomalies. As Earth's natural satellite, the moon plays a vital role in shaping our planet's tides. Its composition consists of various minerals arranged in the core, mantle, and crust layers. By understanding moon gravity and composition, we gain valuable insights into the unique characteristics of this celestial body and its distinctions from Earth and other objects in the cosmos.",science,1

90,Galaxy Clusters Unveil New Evidence for Prevailing Theory of Universe - SciTechDaily,https://scitechdaily.com/?p=275815,"Cosmologists have discovered new support for the standard model of cosmology through their analysis of the structure of galaxy clusters.

A recent study conducted by a team of physicists from the Department of Energy’s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and Stanford University has produced in-depth measurements of X-ray emission from galaxy clusters. These measurements have revealed the internal distribution of matter within the clusters and, as a result, have provided the scientists with an opportunity to examine the Lambda-CDM theory, the current prevailing explanation for the structure and evolution of the universe.

Getting there wasn’t an easy task, however.

Here’s the trouble: Inferring the mass distributions of galaxy clusters from their X-ray emission is most reliable when the energy in the gas within clusters is balanced by the pull of gravity, which holds the whole system together. Measurements of the mass distributions in real clusters, therefore, focus on those that have settled down to a “relaxed” state. When comparing to theoretical predictions, it is, therefore, essential to take this selection of relaxed clusters into account.

Keeping this in mind, Stanford physics graduate student Elise Darragh-Ford and her colleagues examined computer-simulated clusters produced by the The Three Hundred Project. First, they computed what the X-ray emission for each simulated cluster should look like. Then, they applied the same observational criteria used to identify relaxed galaxy clusters from real data to the simulated images to winnow the set down.

The researchers next measured the relationships between three properties – the cluster mass, how centrally concentrated this mass is, and the redshift of the clusters, which reflects how old the universe was when the light we observe was emitted – for both the simulated Three Hundred Project clusters and 44 real clusters observed with NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory.

The team found consistent results from both data sets: overall, clusters have become more centrally concentrated over time, while at any given time, less massive clusters are more centrally concentrated than more massive ones. “The measured relationships agree extremely well between observation and theory, providing strong support for the Lambda-CDM paradigm,” said Darragh-Ford.

In the future, the scientists hope to be able to expand the size of both the observed and simulated galaxy cluster data sets in their analysis. SLAC-supported projects coming online in the next few years, including the Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time and the fourth-generation cosmic microwave background experiment (CMB-S4), will help identify a much larger number of galaxy clusters, while planned space missions, such as the European Space Agency’s ATHENA satellite, can follow up with X-ray measurements. SLAC cosmologists are also working to expand the size and accuracy of computer simulations of the cosmos, making it possible to study galaxy clusters in greater detail and place stringent limits on alternative cosmological scenarios.

91,5 Things I Learned In My First 300 Miles of Backpacking - The Trek,https://thetrek.co/pacific-crest-trail/5-things-i-learned-in-my-first-300-miles-of-backpacking/,"You Live and You Learn

No matter the amount of researching, and planning a newbie backpacker does before a trip, nothing will prepare them better than being on trail.

Like any new hobby there are certain elements that are unknown without trial and error, and very importantly an open mindset to learn from mistakes.



Backpacking, I believe, isn’t just a hobby. Once you’ve been out for awhile, it feels like a new way of life.

Some people know extensively about different gear and already have a developed understanding of their specific needs or manners of hiking before they set out on their big journeys.

You don’t have to know the best ultralight fleece or puffy, you don’t have to be ultralight at all. It takes time to figure out what works best for you.

Here are the things I figured out in my first 300 miles of backpacking:

1. Know your gear, know it well

On day one of the PCT I was at a creek with a group of other hikers taking a break. I started to filter water but realized it was going all out the sides of the bladder. My filter didn’t have the o ring that prevents it from leaking as you squeeze it into your bottle. How did I miss that? I looked over all of my gear a million times before I left. Once I got to camp I asked around if anyone had an extra one, another hiker kindly gave me an extra.



Lesson learned: look over every piece of gear thoroughly, bring backups of small items like o rings or bottle caps in case you lose them.

2. There will always be some kind of pain

Feet hurt all day, blisters feel like huge bruises, thighs chaff nonstop, sunburns so hot I can’t sleep at night. Achilles pain traded for shin splints leaving me with a constant limp even without a pack on. My eyes burn every time I put my contacts in and there are chunks of scabs in my scalp from not showering.

There’s always something hurting. It’s important to realize when it’s serious like shin splints that’ll require you to take multiple zeros or something that’s unavoidable like mega dandruff. Sometimes you’ll have excruciating pain somewhere for a couple days that will go away like it never even happened.

Lesson learned: suck it up, toughen up, hike through the pain but listen to your body.

3. You’re alone, but not really

With the amount of traffic on the PCT you’re never really alone especially in the first couple hundred miles. Though it also depends on the trail. You can be hiking alone for miles but you’re bound to run into someone.

I started feeling homesick about two weeks in. I wanted so badly to share this life with my family.

Somedays I get mad I’m experiencing loneliness, injuries, or extreme fatigue but it’s all part of the journey.

I was at dinner in Idyllwild with a couple other hikers explaining some of the struggles I’ve had so far. One of them said to me that whatever I’m feeling or experiencing everyone else out here is probably dealing with the same things or worse. I’m never really alone. It can feel as though I’m the only person going through a tough day when everyone else looks so put together on the outside. Sorta put together anyway, we’re all filthy. But they’re definitely dealing with battles of their own.

Lesson learned: the hiker community is huge, we all look out for one another. The struggle is normal, talk to other hikers.

4. There are pros and cons hiking in a group

Hiking in a group is great. Sharing experiences with others is important to me, so eating dinner at camp, summiting a mountain, exploring towns is fun and can be more memorable with other hikers.

Not everyone has the same schedule. I wake up very early and like to be on trail as soon as possible. Some hikers take their sweet time getting out of their sleeping bags and make coffee in the morning.

I like to take my long break around noon by a water source if possible and some hikers don’t pre-plan breaks at all.

Some days I can’t do as many miles or vise versa. There will be towns I don’t want to go into but other hikers will.

One morning I woke up and started hiking fully expecting the others to be behind me and to see them on trail that day. I didn’t see them for a couple days.

Lesson learned: Hike your own hike. Don’t try to keep up with anyone, find your hiking style and stick to it. The people you like to hike with, you’ll see them again. Maybe.

5. Trail legs are real

When you first start out you’re like a newborn deer finding your footing. You’re not sure how your legs work yet. It takes time for your body to adjust to walking 15+ miles a day so small injuries in the first couple hundred miles are normal. My body was in a constant state of shock. I had no appetite for the first 200 miles, I got sick the day after I pushed myself 21 miles through 90 degree heat and am still dealing with a gnarly cough. That was just being mindless of my body’s limitations. Your joints, muscles, even your mind need to be broken into trail life and that takes a lot of time. I’ve gained more muscle in my legs, and am finally starting to feel like I can crank out 20 miles everyday. But that doesn’t mean I should. I might feel good, but my body is still adjusting. I’m currently taking two zero days due to shin splints.

Lesson learned: be mindful. Don’t push yourself harder than you need to. Trail legs come with time, work, and patience.

92,Why crab might soon be off the menu - msnNOW,https://talker.news/2023/05/09/why-crab-might-soon-be-off-the-menu/,"Dungeness crab by Handtrollers Beach, Southeast Alaska. (Gillfoto via Wikimedia Commons)

The number of crabs in our oceans is dropping as climate change damages their sense of smell, a new study from Canada reveals.

Increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, mean oceans are forced to absorb more than normal, causing our seas to become more acidic.

This increase in acidity has impacted Dungeness crabs’ sense of smell, preventing them from detecting the smell of food, mates, suitable habitats and avoiding predators.

Dungeness crabs can be found on the Pacific coast, stretching from California to Alaska.

They are one of the most popular crab species to eat. Their fishery was valued at more than $250 million USD, just under £200 million GBP, in 2019.

Like many crabs, they have poor vision, so their sense of smell is crucial.

They sniff through a process known as flicking, where they flick their antennules, which are like small antennas, through the water to detect odors.

Tiny neurons responsible for smell are located inside these antennules, which send electrical signals to the brain.

To reach their results a team from the University of Toronto, Canada, tested the electrical activity in the crabs’ sensory neurons to see if they were less responsive to odors.

When the crabs were exposed to ocean acidification they flicked less and their sensory neurons were 50 percent less responsive to smells.

The study suggests that ocean acidification disrupts odor molecules, which can impact how they bind to smell receptors in marine animals such as crabs.

Co-author Dr. Cosima Porteus, an assistant professor in the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Toronto, Scarborough, said: “This is the first study to look at the physiological effects of ocean acidification on the sense of smell in crabs.

“Crabs increase their flicking rate when they detect an odor they are interested in, but in crabs that were exposed to ocean acidification, the odor had to be 10 times more concentrated before we saw an increase in flicking.”

They also discovered acidification had left them with fewer receptors and their sensory neurons were physically shrinking by as much as 25 percent in volume.

Dr. Porteus added: “These are active cells and if they aren’t detecting odors as much, they might be shrinking to conserve energy. It’s like a muscle that will shrink if you don’t use it.”

Other economically important species, such as Alaskan king and snow crabs, could also be at risk, as their sense of smell functions the same way.

Dr. Porteus said: “Losing their sense of smell seems to be climate-related, so this might partially explain some of the decline in their numbers.

“If crabs are having trouble finding food, it stands to reason females won’t have as much energy to produce eggs.”

Illustration of alternative C transfer pathways from a hypothetical donor tree to a receiving seedling. Blue arrows represent mechanisms for potential distribution of donor tree C into the soil which do not require common mycorrhizal network (CMN) connections between plants. Cellular respiration by the donor tree and its mycorrhizal fungi both release donor C into the soil, as CO 2 which can either be fixed by PEP-carboxylase in the receiving seedling's roots, or via photosynthesis. Root exudation by donor tree fine roots and mycorrhizal mycelium release organic compounds such as carbohydrates, organic acids, and secondary metabolites into the soil. Turnover of donor tree C in roots and mycorrhizal mycelia, assimilation and turnover of donor C by saprotrophic fungi, bacteria, archaea, and redistribution by these and other soil biota can also make C available to the mycorrhizal mycelium of the receiving seedling. Sprocket symbols illustrate the critical checkpoints of C transfer via CMN connections. At the first checkpoint, root cells of the donor tree export sucrose into the symbiotic interface and produce invertases that cleave the sugar into hexoses. The hexoses can be imported into the fungal cell, where they are immediately converted to trehalose and polyols, to maintain the hexose gradient. These compounds can be transported to different parts of the mycelium. At the second checkpoint, CMN transfer between plants would require that the fungal trehalose and polyols be converted back to hexoses and then be exported from the fungal cell into the symbiotic interface, from where the receiving root cell could import it. No such mechanism has been identified to date. Credit: New Phytologist (2023). DOI: 10.1111/nph.18935

Fungal networks interconnecting trees in a forest is a key factor that determines the nature of forests and their response to climate change. These networks have also been viewed as a means for trees to help their offspring and other tree-friends, according to the increasingly popular ""mother tree hypothesis."" An international group of researchers re-examined the evidence for and against this hypothesis in a new study.

Trees in a forest are interconnected through thread-like structures of symbiotic fungi, called hyphae, which together form an underground network called a mycorrhizal network. While it is well known that the mycorrhizal fungi deliver nutrients to trees in exchange for carbon supplied by the trees, the so-called mother tree hypothesis implies a whole new purpose of these networks.

Through the network, the biggest and oldest trees, also known as mother trees, share carbon and nutrients with the saplings growing in particularly shady areas where there is not enough sunlight for adequate photosynthesis.

The network structure should also enable mother trees to detect the ill health of their neighbors through distress signals, alerting them to send these trees the nutrients they need to heal. In this way, mother trees are believed to act as central hubs, communicating with both young seedlings and other large trees around them to increase their chances of survival.

This is a very appealing concept attracting the attention of not only scientists, but also the media, where this hypothesis is often presented as fact. According to the authors of the study just published in New Phytologist, the hypothesis is however hard to reconcile with theory, prompting the researchers to re-examine data and conclusions from publications for and against the mother tree hypothesis.

The study, led by Nils Henriksson at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, found that the empirical evidence for the mother tree hypothesis is actually very limited and theoretical explanations for the mechanisms are largely lacking.

While big trees and their interconnections with their neighbors are still essential for the forest ecosystem, the fungal network does not work as a simple pipeline for resource sharing among trees. This means that apparent resource sharing among trees is more likely to be a result of trading between fungi and trees rather than directed transfer from one tree to another. Very often, this even results in aggravated competition between trees rather than support of seedlings.

""We found that mycorrhizal networks are indeed essential for the stability of many forest ecosystems, but rarely through sharing and caring among trees. Rather, it works like a trading ground for individual trees and fungi, each trying to make the best deal to survive,"" explains Oskar Franklin, a study author and a researcher in the Agriculture, Forestry, and Ecosystem Services Research Group of the IIASA Biodiversity and Natural Resources Program.

""The forest is not a super organism or a family of trees helping each other. It is a complex ecosystem with trees, fungi, and other organisms, which are all interdependent but not guided by a common purpose.""

""Although the narrative of the mother tree hypothesis is scarcely supported by scientific evidence and is controversial in the scientific community, it has inspired both research and public interest in the complexity of forests. It is vital that the future management and study of forests take the real complexity of these important ecosystems into account,"" Franklin concludes.

96,Enormous M87 galaxy looks like giant potato in 1st-ever 3D map (image) - Space.com,https://www.space.com/m87-galaxy-first-3d-map-hubble-keck,"An image of Messier 87 captured by the Hubble Space Telescope (left), along with a 3D map of the giant elliptical galaxy (right). (Image credit: Illustration: NASA, ESA, Joseph Olmsted (STScI), Frank Summers (STScI); Science: Chung-Pei Ma (UC Berkeley))

A massive elliptical galaxy has been mapped in three dimensions for the first time, revealing it has a shape similar to a monstrous cosmic potato.

The model of Messier 87 (M87), which is one of the largest known elliptical galaxies, was created using data from the W.M. Keck Observatory on Maunakea in Hawaii and the Hubble Space Telescope .

This work revealed that the galaxy — which, at around 55 million light-years away, is also one of the closest elliptical galaxies to Earth — is not symmetrical in shape. Instead, M87 has a triaxial shape, much like a humble potato, the research team found.

Since the 1920s, astronomers have classified galaxies according to their shape. However, elliptical galaxies , which tend to look like smooth, near-featureless blobs from afar, have been tough to categorize.

Researchers have therefore been keen to determine the true shape of elliptical galaxies for some time. Such information could help reveal how these galaxies, and the massive black holes at their cores, form. This new 3D model helps astronomers get a better look at the shape of what is considered a prototypical elliptical galaxy.

A better measurement of a supermassive black hole

The team created the new 3D plot of M87 by measuring the motion of stars around its central supermassive black hole, known as M87*, which made history in 2019 when it became the first black hole ever imaged directly, a feat pulled off by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration.

The stellar motion provided new information about the shape of M87 and how it rotates. In addition to this, the motion of the stars allowed scientists to make a new measurement of the mass of the object they orbit, M87*.

The team estimated that the supermassive black hole is about 5.4 billion times more massive than the sun. That's slightly lower than the previous figure of 6.5 billion solar masses, which was calculated using EHT images of the black hole and Einstein's theory of general relativity .

As they continued to map the stellar velocities and the position of the M87 stars, the astronomers created a 3D view of the elliptical galaxy. This map, together with the new estimation of M87*'s mass, could help researchers calculate the speed at which the black hole is rotating.

""Now that we know the direction of the net rotation of stars in M87 and have an updated mass of the black hole, we can combine this information with data from the Event Horizon Telescope to constrain the spin,"" the lead investigator of the new research, Chung-Pei Ma of the University of California, Berkeley, said in a statement (opens in new tab) .

M87 has around 10 times the mass of our own galaxy, the Milky Way , with scientists theorizing that the elliptical galaxy grew as the result of a chain of mergers with other galaxies. As M87 cannibalized these galaxies, its supermassive black hole merged with other central black holes, also growing to a monstrous size.

M87*'s gravity now dominates an area at the center of M87 about 3,000 light-years wide. The team used the Keck II Telescope to observe stars in a 70,000 light-year-wide region that includes this central M87*-dominated area. While the instrument couldn't individually resolve these stars because of how far away M87 is, it did observe the spectra of the stars . This information revealed the range of velocities the team needed to calculate the mass of the object the stars are orbiting.

""It's sort of like looking at a swarm of 100 billion bees,"" Ma said. ""Though we are looking at them from a distance and can't discern individual bees, we are getting very detailed information about their collective velocities.""

The data from Keck, collected between 2020 and 2022, was combined with Hubble observations of star brightness from the same region. This combined data set was then compared to computer model predictions of how stars move around the center of a triaxial-shaped galaxy. From the best fit of this data, the team estimated the black hole's mass.

""Knowing the 3D shape of the 'swarming bees' enabled us to obtain a more robust dynamical measurement of the mass of the central black hole that is governing the bees' orbiting velocities,"" Ma concluded. ""This may point toward a certain direction and range of spin for the black hole, which would be remarkable.""

97,The Eta Lyrid meteor shower peaks May 9 - Space.com,https://www.space.com/eta-lyrids-peak-may-2023,"The annual Eta Lyrids meteor shower will peak tonight (May 9), offering skywatchers the opportunity to see meteors streak through the dark skies over Earth.

The 2023 Eta Lyrids began on May 3 and will end on May 14 this year. According to In the Sky (opens in new tab) the meteor shower is expected to reach peak activity overnight at around 1:00 a.m. EDT (0500 GMT) on May 10. The best time to see the Eta Lyrid meteors is when the shower's radiant point in the Lyra constellation is high above the horizon. The radiant is the point in the sky from which the meteors of a particular shower appear to streak.

From New York City the radiant reaches its highest, or ""culminates"" at 86 degrees above the horizon at around 5:00 a.m. EDT (0900 GMT) on May 10, just after sunrise, meaning the best time to spot meteors is in the hours before dawn. From observers in this part of the world, the radiant will be above the horizon all night, according to In the Sky (opens in new tab), so meteors should be visible all evening and into the early morning.

To locate this late night shower, look to the northeast to find Lyra, easily recognizable thanks to Vega, the constellation's brightest star and the second-brightest in the night sky of the Northern Hemisphere behind Polaris. Once you've found it, get comfortable and allow your eyes to adjust to the dark. With a little patience, you just might catch sight of a few Eta Lyrids.

TOP TELESCOPE PICK: (Image credit: Celestron) Looking for a telescope to observe Lyra or or anything else in the sky? We recommend the Celestron Astro Fi 102 (opens in new tab) as the top pick in our best beginner's telescope guide.

When the radiant is at its highest above an area of the globe, this means that this part of the planet is turned optimally toward the direction that meteors enter Earth's atmosphere. This results in meteors raining down vertically toward Earth, allowing them to be seen as short streaks of light close to the radiant.

At other times when a region of Earth is orientated away from the radiant, instead of raining down vertically, meteors make a more horizontal passage through the atmosphere. This means that they burn up more slowly and give rise to longer streaks of light known as ""Earthgrazers.""

While not the most spectacular of meteor showers, the Eta Lyrids can produce a rate of around three meteors per hour, but this is in ideal viewing conditions with dark skies and clear weather. That means realistic skywatchers should expect to see fewer meteors from the Eta Lyrids, and may have to be a little patient while fireball hunting, with In the Sky estimating the Eta Lyrids will deliver around two meteors per hour.

Further complicating the detection of meteors from the Eta Lyrids will be the fact that the moon is around its last quarter phase during the peak of the shower. The lunar face will thus be half-illuminated and after it rises at around 11:47 p.m. EDT (0347 GMT), meaning the light of the moon could interfere with the chance of spotting meteors.

Like all meteor showers, the Eta Lyrids are created when Earth passes through dusty debris left around the sun by a comet or an asteroid. As icy comets approach the sun, radiation from our star heats material beneath their surfaces, causing it to transform from solid ice to gas in a process called sublimation.

The venting of this gas from the comet causes dust and other fragments to be blown away. This results in comets brightening and accelerating as they approach the sun, and this material can follow the comets as a halo called a ""coma"" or as a characteristic bright tail. Comets can also leave clouds of this material around the sun, which Earth can pass through as it makes its own 365.25-day journey around the star.

As Earth enters a particularly dense cloud of this dusty debris, fragments pass through our planet's atmosphere at speeds as great as 104,000 miles per hour (167,370 km/h), or about 70 times as fast as a jet fighter. As they burn up at altitudes of around 44 to 62 miles (70 to 100 kilometers), these fragments create the streaks we call ""shooting stars.""

The parent body of the Eta Lyrids has been identified as the comet C/1983 H1 (IRAS-Araki-Alcock). The comet has a long orbit around the sun taking around 970 Earth years to circle the star. In 1983, C/1983 H1 made the closest approach to Earth of any comet in the last 200 years, coming to within around 3 million miles of our planet.

98,Artificial intelligence is speeding up astronomy - Axios,https://www.axios.com/2023/05/09/artificial-intelligence-astronomy,"AI is speeding up discoveries about the universe and helping to hone the search for life within it.

Why it matters: Many astronomers spend a large amount of their time combing through data collected by telescopes.

AI and machine learning can be used to quickly pick out intriguing parts of a dataset, making it less likely that astronomers will miss something important.

""With astronomy and these huge datasets, there's always a concern that you missed something, or that you didn't know enough about the objects you're trying to study,"" astronomer Chris Impey of the University of Arizona tells Axios.

What's happening: Last month, scientists revealed an image of the black hole at the center of the galaxy M87 that was reprocessed using a machine learning algorithm. The sharpened image should allow scientists to more accurately estimate the black hole's mass.

Scientists have also used artificial intelligence to make it easier to analyze vast amounts of data gathered by gravitational wave detectors like LIGO, picking out the ripples in space and time created by collisions between black holes or other dense objects.

Now, researchers are using algorithms to figure out characteristics of the objects that produced the gravitational waves in the first place.

AI is also being used to pinpoint newly forming planets around young stars.

The intrigue: SETI (the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) efforts could be helped by AI and machine learning, which are particularly adept at picking out patterns in large sets of data.

SETI — which focuses on trying to pick up radio signals emitted by technically advanced societies — generates huge amounts of data.

""The datasets for SETI endeavors are really massive,"" SETI Institute CEO Bill Diamond tells Axios. ""We generate many tens of terabytes a day.""

The institute and other organizations announced last week that the Very Large Array in New Mexico will join a new experiment to search for radio signals emitted by advanced alien societies, which will rely on machine learning tools.

""When the compute is completely outfitted for that project — which is right now about halfway — we'll be generating seven terabytes per second of data, so extraordinarily huge amounts of data,"" Diamond said. ""And the only way we're going to be able to parse that data to look for interesting phenomena is with machine learning techniques.""

Yes, but: Some worry these tools could spit out false positives that wouldn't otherwise be an issue if humans were analyzing the data.

""It's possible [with] these huge datasets that it could throw so many candidate anomalies at you that you just couldn't keep up and you end up being buried in the candidate anomalies rather than finding new phenomena,"" Impey said.

NASA has also been taking a close look at AI, but a report published last week by the Office of Inspector General stresses there are risks to wide adoption of these tools, including possible cybersecurity threats.

What to watch: Scientists are already training an AI algorithm to help create sharper photos when the Vera Rubin Observatory — tasked with learning more about the nature of dark matter and other science goals — comes online in the coming years.",science,1
99,Webb Telescope snaps shot of first asteroid belt ever seen outside the solar system - Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/science/webb-telescope-snaps-shot-first-asteroid-belt-seen-outside-solar-system,"The first asteroid belt ever seen outside the solar system is more complex than expected, astronomers found, using observations by the James Webb Space Telescope.

Looking at the warm dust around a nearby young star, Fomalhaut, in order to study the belt in infrared light, the scientists found that the structures are more complex than the asteroid and Kuiper dust belts of our solar system.

There are three nested belts extending out to 14 billion miles from the star. The scale of the outer belt is around twice that of our solar system's Kuiper Belt.

The inner belts were revealed by the telescope for the first time.

THE RINGS OF SATURN ARE FALLING IN ON THE PLANET AS ICY RAIN, SCIENTISTS SAY

The dusty belts surround the star, which can be seen as the brightest star in the constellation Piscis Austrinus.

The belts are the debris from collisions of larger bodies, frequently described as ""debris disks.""

While the Hubble Space Telescope, Herschel Space Observatory and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) have previously taken sharp images of the outer belt, none of them found any structure interior to it.

""By looking at the patterns in these rings, we can actually start to make a little sketch of what a planetary system ought to look like – If we could actually take a deep enough picture to see the suspected planets,"" the University of Arizona's András Gáspár, the lead author of this research, said in a statement.

WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE SEES MASSIVE PROTOCLUSTER OF GALAXIES IN THE EARLY UNIVERSE

Hubble, ALMA and Webb are joining forces to get a wider view of the debris disks around multiple stars.

As Webb images more systems, NASA says more will be learned about the configurations of planets that carved the belts with their gravitational forces.

For example, inside our solar system, Jupiter corrals the asteroid belt and the inner edge of the Kuiper Belt is sculpted by Neptune.

""The belts around Fomalhaut are kind of a mystery novel: Where are the planets?"" George Rieke, another team member and U.S. science lead for Webb’s Mid-Infrared Instrument, said. ""I think it's not a very big leap to say there's probably a really interesting planetary system around the star.""

Webb also imaged what Gáspár coined ""the great dust cloud,"" which may be evidence for a collision occurring in the outer ring between two protoplanetary bodies. By 2014, subsequent observations showed that the object had vanished. A possible explanation is that the new feature is an expanding cloud of very fine dust particles from two icy bodies that smashed into each other.

100,Scientists Not Happy With NASA’s Plan to Alter Deep Space Mission - Yahoo News,https://news.yahoo.com/scientists-not-happy-nasa-plan-171000910.html,"An illustration of the New Horizon spacecraft.

It took nearly 15 years for NASA’s New Horizons mission to reach the point where it is at today, around 50 times farther from the Sun than is Earth. From its unique observational perch, the spacecraft has been studying the frozen depths of the solar system to help piece together the origin story of the planets orbiting the Sun.

As the New Horizons spacecraft continues its journey at the outer edge of the solar system, uncertainty lies ahead. NASA is looking to change the primary goal of New Horizons, refocusing the mission to study the Sun’s environment instead of observing objects in the doughnut-shaped ring known as the Kuiper Belt. This has made some people very unhappy.

“NASA spent almost a billion dollars to get this spacecraft to the Kuiper Belt,” Alan Stern, principal investigator for New Horizons, told Gizmodo during a phone interview. “You spend a billion dollars to get a spacecraft all the way across the solar system and then divert it from its primary objective.”

The science team behind the mission has expressed frustration at NASA’s proposal, arguing that the New Horizons spacecraft is functioning and delivering groundbreaking data from its unique position in the distant stretches of the solar system. New Horizons is the fifth spacecraft to reach this distance following Voyager 1 and 2, as well as their predecessors, Pioneer 10 and 11.

But as Stern explained: “No spacecraft has ever explored the Kuiper Belt before and no spacecraft has plans yet to come again,” adding that “we know that if New Horizons is forced to quit exploring the Kuiper Belt, that will be the end of any Kuiper Belt exploration by spacecraft for decades because it takes so long to get out there.”

Story continues

The debate over the future of New Horizons began last year when the science team delivered a proposal to extend the mission for an additional three years. In January 2022, NASA put together a review panel to go over the proposal. The space agency decided to extend the mission for two years instead, and fund New Horizons as a planetary mission until 2024, while considering funding it as a heliophysics mission beginning in 2025.

Aside from exploring the Pluto system and Kuiper Belt objects like Arrokoth, which became the farthest solar system object to be visited by a spacecraft, New Horizons also studies the Sun and its surrounding environment. “The thing is, they’re not in competition,” Stern said. “We do heliophysics observations every single day...and there’s no reason to make it a battle between these two things, they coexist.” The mission team argues that New Horizons can continue being a planetary and heliophysics mission at the same time without it affecting the cost or trajectory of the spacecraft.

NASA, on the other hand, does not see the value in continuing the mission’s Kuiper Belt observations. “A notable primary conclusion of the Panel was that the proposed studies of Kuiper Belt Objects are unlikely to markedly improve knowledge because the spacecraft lacks resources for long term, high cadence observations for light curves, which are necessary for their proposed planetary science goals/objectives,” according to the review report.

“It’s the best preserved part of the solar system in terms of telling us about the origin of the planets and the original days of the solar system, so scientifically it’s a goldmine.”

New Horizons launched in early 2006, headed towards the outer regions of the solar system. The spacecraft was the first to visit Pluto in July 2015, conducting the farthest flyby in history. In 2019, New Horizons searched for its next flyby target, a primordial binary object that was later named Arrokoth (which is Native American for sky). The Kuiper Belt is filled with hundreds of millions of objects, of which New Horizons has so far explored 37.

“From its unique perch in the Kuiper Belt, New Horizons is making observations that can’t be made from anywhere else; even the stars look different from the spacecraft’s point of view,” NASA wrote in 2021.

According to Stern, the New Horizons team is currently looking for a second flyby object, and planning observations of Saturn and its moons (the spacecraft has previously explored Neptune and Uranus). Everything in the Kuiper Belt “was formed billions of years ago and is extremely well preserved,” Stern said. “It’s the best preserved part of the solar system in terms of telling us about the origin of the planets and the original days of the solar system, so scientifically it’s a goldmine.”

Stern started working on the New Horizons mission more than 20 years ago when it was just an idea. Today, he fears that the mission team would be disbanded if NASA’s decision goes into effect. The team, as well as other members of the planetary science community, has been lobbying to try and get NASA to reverse its decision. Aside from planetary scientists, a group of heliophysicists has also drafted an open letter highlighting how New Horizons can continue to be a “powerful cross-divisional tool.”

“New Horizons has enabled uninterrupted heliophysics measurements throughout the heliosphere for over a decade, alongside its groundbreaking Kuiper Belt and other planetary observations,” the letter, which was sent out on Monday, read. The conduct of the mission’s heliophysics observations is both synoptic and in no way in competition with its planetary science observations of the Kuiper Belt and Kuiper Belt Objects.”

The New Horizons team is also in conversations with NASA, but that has “not been effective,” according to Stern. “Our team believes that it’s very short sighted and premature to quit exploring the Kuiper Belt,” Stern said. “It took us more than a decade to fly across the solar system to be in the Kuiper Belt, and we think it’s unwise and a bad use of NASA money to move the mission away from Kuiper Belt exploration.”

101,Lighting the Path to High-Speed Computing: Terahertz Laser Pulses Transform Ferromagnetism - SciTechDaily,https://scitechdaily.com/lighting-the-path-to-high-speed-computing-terahertz-laser-pulses-transform-ferromagnetism/,"Researchers have used terahertz light pulses to induce ferromagnetism in a crystal at temperatures far above its normal transition temperature, paving the way for optically controlled memory and computing devices with higher speed and efficiency.

Scientists in Germany and the USA have shown for the first time that terahertz (THz) light pulses can stabilize ferromagnetism in a crystal at temperatures more than three times its usual transition temperature. As the team reports in the journal Nature, using pulses just hundreds of femtoseconds long (a millionth of a billionth of a second), a ferromagnetic state was induced at high temperature in the rare-earth titanate YTiO 3 which persisted for many nanoseconds after the light exposure. Below the equilibrium transition temperature, the laser pulses still strengthened the existing magnetic state, increasing the magnetization up to its theoretical limit.

Using light to control magnetism in solids is a promising platform for future technologies. Today’s computers mainly rely on the flow of electrical charge to process information. Moreover, digital memory storage devices make use of magnetic bits that must be switched external magnetic fields. Both of these aspects limit the speed and energy efficiency of current computing systems. Using light instead to optically switch memory and computing devices could revolutionize processing speeds and efficiency.

YTiO 3 is a transition metal oxide that only becomes ferromagnetic, with properties resembling those of a fridge magnet, below 27 K or –246° Celsius. At these low temperatures, the spins of the electrons on the titanium atoms align in a particular direction. It is this collective ordering of the spins which gives the material as a whole a macroscopic magnetization and turns it ferromagnetic. In contrast, at temperatures above 27 K, the individual spins fluctuate randomly so that no ferromagnetism develops.

Using a powerful THz light source developed at the Max Planck Institute for the Structure and Dynamics of Matter (MPSD) in Hamburg, Germany, the team managed to achieve ferromagnetism in YTiO 3 up to nearly 100 K (­–193° C), far above its normal transition temperature. The light-induced state also persisted for many nanoseconds. The intense light pulse is designed to ‘shake’ the material’s atoms in a coordinated way, allowing the electrons to align their spins.

“The frequencies of the pulses are tuned to drive specific vibrations of the YTiO 3 crystal lattice, called phonons,” explains lead author Ankit Disa. “We found that when we excite one particular phonon at its natural frequency of 9 THz, the collective order of the spins and the orbitals of the electrons are modified, leading to a stronger tendency towards a ferromagnetic state. When driving other phonons, we observed totally different results: Excitation of a phonon at 4 THz actually worsens the ferromagnetism and of one at 17 THz enhances it – but not as strongly as the 9 THz phonon does.”

Below the usual transition temperature of 27 K, the 9 THz phonon excitation significantly increased the magnetization, raising it by around 20 percent to its theoretical maximum – a level that had not been achieved to date.

The THz source used in these experiments delivers intense pulses and is capable of exciting a very narrow frequency region in the material, making it an extremely precise tool. It has already been deployed in several other MPSD-led studies on light-enhanced superconductivity and magnetism. However, this work revealed for the first time that qualitatively different effects can be produced by exciting a range of lattice vibrations.

Apart from deepening scientists’ understanding of intense and ultrafast light-matter interactions, these results are important stepping stones toward the optical control of magnetic components.

“This work does not only demonstrate the switching of magnetism on and off on demand, it also gives us a foretaste of what could be done to store and process information at ultra-high speeds,“ explains Andrea Cavalleri, Director of the MPSD’s Condensed Matter Dynamics Department.

“Beyond this demonstration, our work underscores the ability to create order in disordered, fluctuating phases of matter, something akin to freezing water with light. Controlling these processes has been a long-standing goal of our group. Over the years we have reported a number of other realizations that flank this work, including photo-induced high-temperature superconductivity[1,2] and photo-induced ferroelectricity.[3]”

103,Cosmonauts Caught Littering Directly Into Space During Spacewalk - Futurism,https://futurism.com/the-byte/cosmonauts-littering-space-during-spacewalk,"Hey! Pick that up!

Take Out the Trash

After completing a seven-hour spacewalk to move an airlock from one part of the International Space Station to another, Russian cosmonauts Sergey Prokopyev and Dmitri Petelin intentionally yeeted a sizeable bundle of discarded hardware drift away into space.

""Bye bye,"" said one of the cosmonauts after letting go of the bundle during a livestream of the spacewalk. ""Just flies beautifully.""

While that sound feel like the equivalent of throwing trash out a car window, experts say the bundle will harmlessly burn up in the Earth's atmosphere, the BBC reports — effectively using the atmosphere as an enormous trash incinerator.

While it was an intentional act, experts have warned that errant pieces of astronaut equipment could add to our existing space junk problem.

Drifting Off

It's not always intentional. For instance, NASA astronaut Ed White infamously lost a spare glove while venturing outside of the Gemini 4 spacecraft back in 1965. In 2017, astronauts Peggy Whitson and Shane Kimbrough lost a bag containing a debris shield during a spacewalk.

Still, burning up junk in the atmosphere has become a well-established convention for the space station. Crew members regularly load their trash into a Cygnus cargo spacecraft to have it and the garbage inside of it burn up on re-entry.

Other manmade objects orbiting the planet, including SpaceX's broadband-beaming internet satellites, are also designed to burn up in the atmosphere at the end of their lifespan.

Space Littering

Nonetheless, something about watching cosmonauts send a giant pack of discarded hardware spinning into the distance feels off.

After all, the Earth's orbit has become incredibly cluttered over the years as human space exploration efforts have increased.

The Department of Defense is tracking more than 23,000 pieces of debris larger than the size of a softball in the Earth's orbit. Experts estimate there are some 100 million pieces of debris roughly one millimeter in diameter littering the space around our planet.

While that's small, they can still do considerable damage. The ISS has had to make several maneuvers over the years to dodge incoming space junk.

Whether the station will ever find itself in the ironic position of encountering errant hardware left behind by its own spacewalking astronauts, though, remains to be seen.

For a new study, a team of physicists recruited roughly 1,000 undergraduate students at the University of Colorado Boulder to help answer one of the most enduring questions about the sun: How does the star's outermost atmosphere, or ""corona,"" get so hot?

The research represents a nearly-unprecedented feat of data analysis: From 2020 to 2022, the small army of mostly first- and second-year students examined the physics of more than 600 real solar flares—gigantic eruptions of energy from the sun's roiling corona.

The researchers, including 995 undergraduate and graduate students, published their finding in The Astrophysical Journal. The results suggest that solar flares may not be responsible for superheating the sun's corona, as a popular theory in astrophysics suggests.

""We really wanted to emphasize to these students that they were doing actual scientific research,"" said James Mason, lead author of the study and an astrophysicist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.

Study co-author Heather Lewandowski agreed, noting that the study wouldn't be possible without the undergrads who contributed an estimated 56,000 hours of work to the project.

""It was a massive effort from everyone involved,"" said Lewandowski, professor of physics and fellow of JILA, a joint research institute between CU Boulder and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

Campfire physics

The study zeroes in on a mystery that has left even senior astrophysicists scratching their heads.

Telescope observations suggest that the sun's corona sizzles at temperatures of millions of degrees Fahrenheit. The surface of the sun, in contrast, is much cooler, registering only in the thousands of degrees.

""That's like standing right in front of a campfire, and as you back away, it gets a lot hotter,"" Mason said. ""It makes no sense.""

Some scientists suspect that especially tiny flares, or ""nanoflares,"" which are too small for even the most advanced telescopes to spot, may be responsible. If such events exist, they may pop up across the sun on a nearly constant basis. And, the theory goes, they could add up to make the corona toasty. Think of boiling a pot of water using thousands of individual matches.

The students' results cast doubt on this theory, Mason said, although he thinks it's too early to say for sure.

""I was hoping our result was going to be different. I still feel like nanoflares are an important driver of coronal heating,"" Mason said. ""But the evidence from our paper suggests the opposite. I'm a scientist. I have to go where the evidence is pointing.""

Peak pandemic times

The effort began at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In spring 2020, CU Boulder, like most universities around the country, had moved its courses entirely online. Lewandowski, however, faced a predicament: She was teaching a class on hands-on research called ""Experimental Physics I"" that fall, and she had nothing for her students to do.

""This was peak pandemic times,"" Lewandowski said. ""It's sometimes hard to remember back to what life was like then. These students were very isolated. They were really stressed.""

Mason, who was then a researcher at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) at CU Boulder, offered an idea.

The scientist had long wanted to dig into the mathematics of solar flares. In particular, he had tried examining a dataset of thousands of flares that occurred between 2011 and 2018 and had been spotted by instruments in space. They included the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) series and NASA's Miniature X-ray Solar Spectrometer (MinXSS), a CubeSat mission designed and built at LASP.

The problem: There were just too many flares to examine on his own.

That's when Mason and Lewandowski turned to the students for help.

Mason explained that you can infer details about the behavior of nanoflares by studying the physics of larger flares, which scientists have observed directly for decades.

To do just that, students split into groups of three or four and picked a normal flare they wanted to analyze over the course of the semester. Then, through a series of lengthy calculations, they added up how much heat could each of these events pour into the sun's corona.

Their calculations painted a clear picture: The sum of the sun's nanoflares likely wouldn't be powerful enough to heat up its corona to millions of degrees Fahrenheit.

Educational experiences

What is making the corona so hot isn't clear. A competing theory suggests that waves in the sun's magnetic field carry energy from inside the sun to its atmosphere.

But the study's actual findings aren't its only important results. Lewandowski said her students were able to have opportunities that are rare for scientists and engineers so early in their careers—to learn first-hand about the collaborative and often-messy way that scientific research works in the real world.

""We still hear students talking about this course in the halls,"" she said. ""Our students were able to build a community and support each other at a time that was really tough.""

Quantum advances rely on the production of nanoscale wires that are based on several state-of-the-art nanolithographic technologies, to develop wires via bottom-up synthesis. However, a critical challenge is to grow uniform atomic crystalline wires and construct network structures to build nanocircuits.

In a new report in Science Advances, Tomoya Asaba and a team of researchers in physics and materials science at the Kyoto University, the University of Tokyo in Japan, and the Institute of Theoretical Physics in Germany, discovered a simple method to develop atomic-scale wires in the shape of nano-rings, stripes and X-/Y- junctions.

Using pulsed-laser-deposition, the physicists and materials scientists grew single crystalline, atomic-scale wires of a Mott insulator, which maintained a bandgap comparable to wide-gap semiconductors. Such wires were a unit cell in thickness and a few microns in length. The researchers observed atomic pattern formation through non-equilibrium reaction-diffusion processes to offer a hitherto unknown perspective on the phenomena of atomic-scale self-organization to gain insight to the formation of quantum architecture in nano-networks.

New methods to engineer atomic-scale nanowires

The basic features of most technical devices change when their dimensions are reduced. When a device is reduced to the nanoscale, the fabrication and integration of one-dimensional wire patterns become increasingly complex. Developing top-down approaches with large-scale equipment such as electron beam and focused ion beam lithography to include nanowires with a thickness and width less than 10 nanometers is another technical challenge.

Similarly, bottom-up technologies that use self-assembly processes cannot effectively determine the uniformity of the wires either. During bottom-up engineering, nanowire array integration depends on two complicated steps of growing randomly oriented nanowires first, and then aligning them into an array; therefore, this calls for a new approach to fabricate uniform, atomic-scale wires, and engineer nanopatterns.

In this work, Asaba and colleagues engineered uniform and long, single-crystalline wires of ruthenium trichloride (RuCl 3 ) at the atomic scale via a simple deposition method. They manufactured several characteristic patterns necessary to realize quantum nanocircuits including atomically smooth junctions and nanorings. The ruthenium trichloride material is interesting as a Mott insulator where electron-electron interactions open an energy gap. The team formed and integrated the nanowire patterns as part of a thin-film growth process, thereby diverging from the conventional method behind atomic scale wire patterns—to promote self-organization instead.

Engineering nanocircuits

During the experiments, the team melted the ruthenium trichloride on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite surfaces by using pulsed-laser-deposition and observed the outcome with scanning tunneling microscopy. They obtained an atomic-resolution image of a sample grown at intense deposition temperatures to detect a surface covered by a unique pattern of wires. While each wire consisted of periodically spaced atoms, they noted a single crystalline structure. The materials scientists then studied the material forming the atomic-scale wires by extending the deposition time to grow a two-dimensional monolayer and thicker films and verified its composition to be crystallized ruthenium trichloride.

The atomic wires maintained a length exceeding 3 micrometers as a unique and unprecedented feature. They also contained two or four ruthenium trichloride single crystalline chains growing on pyrolytic graphite surfaces. In its constitution, the wires consisted of quadrupole chains of the material at first, which later reduced to double chains with decreasing temperatures to form atomically smooth junctions and rings without defects and clusters to eventually engineer the nanocircuits.

Characterizing the nanocircuits

The materials scientists next studied the electronic structure of the materials by measuring differential tunneling conductance, and compared the outcomes with various forms of the material and pyrolytic graphite surfaces. They noted clear energetic gaps in ruthenium trichloride, indicative of semiconducting or insulating electronic structures.

They unveiled the origin of the energy gap through systematic band calculations of variant forms of ruthenium trichloride materials, including a two-chain wire and its monolayer, and bulk forms, to observe electron correlations and spin-orbit interactions. The material eventually revealed an open energy gap at the Fermi energy across all experimental constructs used in the study to confirm the material as a Mott insulator.

Mechanisms of pattern formation

The team credited the formation of the nanowire array to thin-film growth that differed from any process hitherto known. Aside from stripe patterns observed during the experiments, the team discussed the mechanisms underlying pattern formation and the emergence of several distinct characteristic features. According to the patterns, static interactions were not the driving force of the atomic-wire array.

Instead, they credited the feature to non-equilibrium reaction-diffusion processes. Since scanning tunneling microscopy was too slow to capture the dynamic processes of thin-film growth, the team expect to conduct direct measurements of the dynamic process at the atomic scale to fully understand the growth mechanism.

DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.abq5561

Outlook

In this way, Tomoya Asaba and colleagues assumed reaction-diffusion mechanisms to stimulate the origin of pattern formation in atomic wires, leading to the manifestation of stripe patterns via Turing instability. The feature contributed to the spontaneous emergence of spatially periodic patterns.

The nanowires and junctions dramatically increased the integration of electronic circuits, to provide a physical playground to explore the phenomenon of atomic-scale-based, non-equilibrium self-organization suited for exotic electronic states and for quantum advances.

Espresso coffee is brewed by first grinding roasted coffee beans into grains. Hot water then forces its way through a bed of coffee grains at high pressure, and the soluble content of the coffee grains dissolves into the water (extraction) to produce espresso.

In 2020, researchers found that more finely ground coffee beans brew a weaker espresso. This counterintuitive experimental result makes sense if, for some reason, regions exist within the coffee bed where less or even no coffee is extracted. This uneven extraction becomes more pronounced when coffee is ground more finely.

In Physics of Fluids, University of Huddersfield researchers explored the role of uneven coffee extraction using a simple mathematical model. They split the coffee into two regions to examine whether uneven flow does in fact make weaker espresso.

One of the regions in the model system hosted more tightly packed coffee than the other, which caused an initial disparity in flow resistance because water flows more quickly through more tightly packed grains. The extraction of coffee decreased the flow resistance further, as coffee grains lose about 20% to 25% of their mass during the process.

""Our model shows that flow and extraction widened the initial disparity in flow between the two regions due to a positive feedback loop, in which more flow leads to more extraction, which in turn reduces resistance and leads to more flow,"" said co-author William Lee. ""This effect appears to always be active, and it isn't until one of the regions has all of its soluble coffee extracted that we see the experimentally observed decrease in extraction with decreasing grind size.""

In this figure, Q is the rate of flow, epsilon is the porosity (which increases as coffee is extracted), and c is the concentration of dissolved coffee (a measure of the strength of the espresso). Credit: W.T. Lee, A. Smith, and A. Arshad

The researchers were surprised to find the model always predicts uneven flow across different parts of the coffee bed.

""This is important because the taste of the coffee depends on the level of extraction,"" said Lee. ""Too little extraction and the taste of the coffee is what experts call 'underdeveloped,' or as I describe it: smoky water. Too much extraction and the coffee tastes very bitter. These results suggest that even if it looks like the overall extraction is at the right level, it might be due to a mixture of underdeveloped and bitter coffee.""

Understanding the origin of uneven extraction and avoiding or preventing it could enable better brews and substantial financial savings by using coffee more efficiently.

""Our next step is to make the model more realistic to see if we can obtain more detailed insights into this confusing phenomenon,"" said Lee. ""Once this is achieved, we can start to think about whether it is possible to make changes to the way espresso coffee is brewed to reduce the amount of uneven extraction.""

107,Long and Broad Noses on Modern Humans Were Inherited From Neanderthals - Ancient Origins,https://www.ancient-origins.net/news-evolution-human-origins/neanderthal-nose-0018417,"Long dismissed for being our brutish ancestors, we share more with Neanderthals than we think, and increasingly research is showing us just how much there is in common. Scientists have run computer simulations that have revealed vital information about the evolution of large, broad Neanderthal noses.

These noses have displayed the ability to regulate the cold, dry air of the Ice Age , and meeting high oxygen demand of our ancient cousins (as discovered in a 2018 study ). They show that this unique shape survived through inter-species reproduction, currently existing in certain modern humans . The distinctive nose structure influenced its height and length, enduring tens of thousands of years of natural selection before being detected in present times.

A Broad Sample Size and Base

The findings of this landmark study, a follow up to a 2021 study about genes determining face shapes, have been published in the journal Communications Biology . The interdisciplinary team from across the world studied the genetic information of and from 6,000 modern humans of mixed European, Native American, and African ancestry from Latin America.

Co-corresponding author Professor Andres Ruiz-Linares from Fudan University, UCL Genetics, Evolution & Environment, and Aix-Marseille University explained in a press release :

“Most genetic studies of human diversity have investigated the genes of Europeans; our study’s diverse sample of Latin American participants broadens the reach of genetic study findings, helping us to better understand the genetics of all humans.”

These findings were then cross-referenced with the measurements of the facial features of the individuals, especially their noses and the tips of their lips. Utilizing advanced software, the research team from the University College London identified 106 facial landmarks encompassing regions such as the eyes, nose, mouth, temples, and chin.

“Different shaped noses may be better suited to different climates that our ancestors lived in,” added lead author Qing Li of Fudan University. “The gene we have identified here may have been inherited from Neanderthals to help humans adapt to colder climates as our ancestors moved out of Africa.”

Neanderthals and Modern Humans: Closer than Imagined

The close genetic relationship between humans and Neanderthals has been established since the sequencing of the first Neanderthal genome in 2010, revealing a shared ancestral lineage. This connection allowed genetic traits to be passed down, maintaining the ancient bond between the two species.

Neanderthals were highly sociable and intelligent, physically shorter than moder humans, and had barrel chests and pronounced brows. Numerous studies have shown that their bodies were built for endurance.

In an important discovery made last June, scientists unveiled a specific genetic variation that can be traced back to a single interbreeding event with Neanderthals. This genetic tweak has been found to double the risk of severe Covid-19 in individuals who carry it today.

Neanderthals, who existed as a distinct human species, have contributed approximately 1 to 4 percent of the genomes of non-African modern humans. However, it is assumed that individuals of African descent from regions south of the Sahara have no detectable Neanderthal DNA in their genetic makeup.

Sequencing DNA: The Inheritance of Loss

Dr Kaustubh Adhikari, who co-led the study, explained:

“In the last 15 years, since the Neanderthal genome has been sequenced, we have been able to learn that our own ancestors apparently interbred with Neanderthals, leaving us with little bits of their DNA. Here, we find that some DNA inherited from Neanderthals influences the shape of our faces.”

The study uncovered 33 genome regions that correlated with facial features, including a Neanderthal-derived region named ATF3, responsible for the development of longer noses. The aforementioned study in 2021 had expanded on this research, identifying 32 modern gene regions associated with facial characteristics among the same 6,000 participants, including nine novel discoveries.

The researchers found that many people in their study with Native American ancestry (as well as others with east Asian ancestry from another group), exhibited this gene. An even earlier study had found that the expression of ATF3 is regulated by another transcription factor, FOXL2, mutations of which “are known to lead to alterations of the midface.”

These findings included a gene called TBX15, linked to the ancient Denisovan people who inhabited Central Asia and interbred with early Homo sapiens . Interestingly, not all individuals possess this gene sequence, suggesting its potential role in better adapting to the cold climates of Central Asia through body fat distribution, reports Discover Magazine .

Andres Ruiz-Linares, a professor at Fudan University concluded that, “research like this can provide basic biomedical insights and help us understand how humans evolved."" Indeed, 40,000 years later, remnants of our lost relatives live on in earnest in our gene pool.

Most diamonds are formed deep inside Earth and brought close to the surface in small yet powerful volcanic eruptions of a kind of rock called ""kimberlite.""

Our supercomputer modeling, published in Nature Geoscience, shows these eruptions are fueled by giant ""pillars of heat"" rooted 2,900 kilometers below ground, just above our planet's core.

Understanding Earth's internal history can be used to target mineral reserves—not only diamonds, but also crucial minerals such as nickel and rare earth elements.

Kimberlite and hot blobs

Kimberlite eruptions leave behind a characteristic deep, carrot-shaped ""pipe"" of kimberlite rock, which often contains diamonds. Hundreds of these eruptions that occurred over the past 200 million years have been discovered around the world. Most of them were found in Canada (178 eruptions), South Africa (158), Angola (71) and Brazil (70).

Between Earth's solid crust and molten core is the mantle, a thick layer of slightly goopy hot rock. For decades, geophysicists have used computers to study how the mantle slowly flows over long periods of time.

In the 1980s, one study showed that kimberlite eruptions might be linked to small thermal plumes in the mantle—feather-like upward jets of hot mantle rising due to their higher buoyancy—beneath slowly moving continents.

It had already been argued, in the 1970s, that these plumes might originate from the boundary between the mantle and the core, at a depth of 2,900km.

Then, in 2010, geologists proposed that kimberlite eruptions could be explained by thermal plumes arising from the edges of two deep, hot blobs anchored under Africa and the Pacific Ocean.

And last year, we reported that these anchored blobs are more mobile than we thought.

However, we still didn't know exactly how activity deep in the mantle was driving kimberlite eruptions.

Pillars of heat

Geologists assumed that mantle plumes could be responsible for igniting kimberlite eruptions. However, there was still a big question remaining: how was heat being transported from the deep Earth up to the kimberlites?

To address this question, we used supercomputers in Canberra, Australia to create three-dimensional geodynamic models of Earth's mantle. Our models account for the movement of continents on the surface and into the mantle over the past one billion years.

We calculated the movements of heat upward from the core and discovered that broad mantle upwellings, or ""pillars of heat,"" connect the very deep Earth to the surface. Our modeling shows these pillars supply heat underneath kimberlites, and they explain most kimberlite eruptions over the past 200 million years.

The model successfully captured kimberlite eruptions in Africa, Brazil, Russia and partly in the United States and Canada. Our models also predict previously undiscovered kimberlite eruptions occurred in East Antarctica and the Yilgarn Craton of Western Australia. Earth’s “pillars of heat” in a global mantle convection model can be used to predict kimberlite eruptions. Credit: Ömer F. Bodur

Towards the center of the pillars, mantle plumes rise much faster and carry dense material across the mantle, which may explain chemical differences between kimberlites in different continents.

Our models do not explain some of the kimberlites in Canada, which might be related to a different geological process called ""plate subduction."" We have so far predicted kimberlites back to one billion years ago, which is the current limit of reconstructions of tectonic plate movements.

A team of scientists has discovered more than 19,000 new seamounts – ancient volcanoes – at the bottom of the ocean. The team used satellite data to make the discovery. Data analyst Julie Gevorgian of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California led the team that discovered the seamounts. Her team said in a new paper that only 20% of the ocean floor has been mapped by ships. And they said there might be thousands more seamounts yet undiscovered on the ocean floor

Volcanic activity on the ocean floor creates the seamounts, which can rise to around 3 to 10 kilometers (about 2 to 6 miles) high. Smaller seamounts (less than 2 km) are harder to find, according to Claire Watson, who reported on the discovery earlier this month (May 2, 2023) at ScienceAlert. She said they:

… tend to form near mid-ocean ridges where magma pushes through Earth’s thin and fractured crust.

And Watson commented that these underwater mountains can:

… rise thousands of meters in the darkness [of the deep sea], putting unsuspecting submarines at risk.

The American Geophysical Union’s open-access journal Earth and Space Sciences published the new study online on April 6, 2023.

Here’s how they found the volcanoes

According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, three-quarters of all Earth’s volcanic activity happens underwater. But – just as on Earth – the undersea volcanoes aren’t all active.

So how can we find the seamounts? Ships can detect them via sonar, a technique that uses sound waves to bounce off the ocean floor. But that can happen only when the ships happen to pass over the seamounts.

Gevorgian’s team used a different technique – called satellite altimetry – which lets scientists measure changes not in the sea floor itself, but in the sea surface height. A change in the height of the sea surface can, in turn, reflect an increased pull of gravity coming from the presence of the seamounts (the volcanoes) on the sea floor. Watson wrote:

The larger the mound, the more its gravitational pull draws in seawater on top. Using this method, Gevorgian and colleagues identified 19,325 new undersea volcanoes, adding to the 24,643 mapped seamounts that two members of the team had previously cataloged back in 2011 and ironing out some mistakes in the process. In fact, that brings the total to 43,454 undersea mountains, almost doubling the number we knew about.

She wrote that many of the newly discovered seamounts were previously too small to be detectable in satellite data. But:

… Recent advances to expand coverage and improve the accuracy of satellite data from the European Space Agency’s CryoSat-2 satellite and SARAL, the Indian and French space agencies’ version, changed the picture.

Why study seamounts?

According to NatureWorldNews.com:

Scientists can better understand the tectonic plates and the geomagnetic field of the Earth by mapping the locations of seamounts. According to the study, volcanoes can provide information about the makeup and temperature of the Earth’s mantle. And deep ocean currents are impacted by seamounts. When currents and seamounts interact, the currents are pushed upward and carry cold water … [Finally], since seamounts are rich in minerals and can serve as a habitat for a variety of marine life, scientists have set out to explore and map out as many seamounts as they can to learn more about what lies beneath the ocean’s surface.

Bottom line: A team of scientists has just discovered more than 19,000 ancient volcanoes – aka seamounts – at the bottom of the ocean.

110,The 1st photo of Earth from Europe's powerful new satellite is amazing - Space.com,https://www.space.com/earth-1st-photo-europe-weather-satellite,"Europe's newest weather satellite has snapped an image of the Earth that reveals our planet's incredible beauty, despite gathering clouds.

The image taken by Meteosat Third Generation — Imager 1 (MTG-I1) shows conditions over Europe, Africa, and the Atlantic to an incredible level of detail and demonstrates that the satellite is set to live up to its promise of revolutionizing weather forecasting including the prediction of severe weather.

""This image is a great example of what European cooperation in space can achieve,"" ESA's Director of Earth Observation Programmes, Simonetta Cheli, said in a statement. (opens in new tab) ""The level of detail MTG-I1's image reveals, unachievable over Europe and Africa from a geostationary orbit until now, will give us a greater understanding of our planet and the weather systems that shape it.""

Launched on Dec. 12, 2022 aboard an Ariane 5 rocket, MTG-I1 represents the first of a new generation of weather satellites, the MTG system, to be operated by Europe's meteorological satellite agency, EUMETSAT, and the European Space Agency (ESA). The full system is set to be operational by 2026 and will consist of six satellites supplying critical data for the early detection of extreme weather events for the next two decades.

The new picture released this week by EUMETSAT and the ESA was taken by the satellite's Flexible Combined Imager on March 18, 2023. It shows a large region of Northern and Western Europe and Scandinavia blanketed in clouds, while Italy and the Western Balkans enjoy relatively clear skies.

Also seen in the image are cloud vortices swirling over the Canary Islands, snow covering the Alps and even sediment in water along the coast of Italy. As ESA notes in a separate release (opens in new tab) comparing these new images with older ones, none of these details are as clearly visible in images from the Meteosat Second Generation satellites which MTG-I1 and its fellow third-generation spacecraft companions will eventually replace. In fact, some of these features have been absent altogether in last-generation satellite images.

MTG-I1 has also demonstrated its capability to observe cloud structures at high latitudes, which will help weather forecasters to track the rapid development of severe weather in these regions of the globe.

""This remarkable image gives us great confidence in our expectation that the MTG system will herald a new era in the forecasting of severe weather events,"" EUMETSAT director general, Phil Evans, said in ESA's statement. ""It might sound odd to be so excited about a cloudy day in most of Europe. But the level of detail seen for the clouds in this image is extraordinarily important to weather forecasters.""

The third generation of Meteosat meteorological satellites won't take images only at a higher resolution than that its predecessors, but they will also snap images of the planet more frequently than the instruments of the second generation of satellites. The system will produce images of the full disc of Earth every 10 minutes once it is fully operational. This frequency will also be important to the MTG system's ability to monitor severe weather.

""The high-resolution and frequent repeat cycle of the Flexible Combined Imager will greatly help the World Meteorological Organization community to improve forecasts of severe weather, long-term climate monitoring, marine applications, and agricultural meteorology, and will make an important contribution to the Early Warnings For All (opens in new tab) Initiative, in particular on the African continent,"" Head of the World Meteorological Organization Space Systems and Utilization Division, WMO, Natalia Donoho, said in the statement.

MTG-I1 won't be supplying data to meteorological services in Europe and the rest of the globe until the tail end of 2023. Over the next 12 months, its operators will switch on the satellite's Flexible Combined Imager and the Lightning Imager instruments and will calibrate the data it collects.

The MTG-I1 will soon be joined in orbit by a revolutionary MTG Sounding (MTG-S) satellite carrying an Infrared Sounder and an Ultraviolet Visible Near-Infrared spectrometer. MTG-S will allow atmospheric instability to be modeled in three dimensions throughout the clouds, making it a significant step forward for severe thunderstorm early warning.

""Following the launch of the MTG-I1 satellite, the momentum in the MTG program is relentless,"" ESA's Meteosat program manager Paul Blythe said. ""The initial results from MTG-I1 are hugely motivating for those who have worked on the program and create a major impetus to complete the full MTG constellation by 2026.""

The MTG-S satellite is expected to be finished by mid-next year and should also be able to provide data regarding ozone, carbon monoxide, and volcanic ash in Earth's atmosphere.

Relativity Space launched its first 3D-printed rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, this March, and while the test flight failed to reach orbit, the space startup hasn't paused in its goal of offering a cheaper and quicker-to-manufacture rocket for future missions to the moon and Mars. Founded in Long Beach, California, by CEO Tim Ellis, a rocket space engineer previously with Blue Origin, the company aims to challenge Elon Musk's SpaceX and is among a number of commercial entrants testing rockets that can carry payloads to orbit and ultimately complete missions. Relativity Space is transforming the market with automated aerospace manufacturing that integrates intelligent robotics, algorithms, machine learning and 3D printing of rocket parts that can be reused. It's continuing a series of tests of its 3D-printed rockets at prices for commercial missions that are far less than the launch cost of NASA's Space Shuttle in 1981.

The company's futuristic rocket factory features the Stargate and Reaper giant metal 3D printers that created the company's first 3D-printed rocket, the Terran 1, and are now focused on its Terran R, a second larger, reusable rocket designed for commercial and governmental use. The company recently told CNBC it is going all-in on the bigger design, and as a result would shift to use some conventional metals manufacturing in addition to its novel 3D-printing process. Through a partnership this past June with Los Angeles-based transport specialist Impulse Space Propulsion, Relativity Space aims to deliver an inaugural commercial payload to Mars on the Terran R by 2024. The global space economy is expected by Citi Global Perspectives & Solutions to generate $1 trillion in annual sales by 2040. That's up from $469 billion in 2021, according to U.S. nonprofit The Space Foundation. Satellites, which make up 70% of today's space market, could triple to $697 billion by 2040. In this intensifying space exploration race, the priority is on substantially lower launch costs through reusable rockets and launch vehicles, new materials and fuels, more cost-efficient production methods, and advancements in robotics and electronics systems, the Citi report noted.

112,Giving A Tinge Of Color To The Mars Map Courtesy Of The UAE's Hope Orbiter - Hackaday,https://hackaday.com/2023/05/09/giving-a-tinge-of-color-to-the-mars-map-courtesy-of-the-uaes-hope-orbiter/,"Since the United Arab Emirates’ Hope (“Al-Amal”) orbiter made it safely into orbit around Mars on February 9, 2021, it’s been busy using its onboard instruments to measure everything it could about not only the planet’s atmosphere but also its surface and how both change seasonally. The first months of results of these detailed captures of Mars have now been released in the form of the full-color Mars Atlas website, and a pretty well made PDF version of the Atlas that can be downloaded from the website.

Although the Emirates Mars Mission is not the first to capture the surface or seasons of Mars — with the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO)’s Context Camera (CTX) having gifted us the result of many thousands of captures in a massive monochrome mosaic of Mars’ surface — it’s good to remember that Hope is only just getting started. The current atlas is the result of about 3,000 captures from the Emirates eXploration Imager (EXI) multi-band camera (with better than 8 km spatial resolution), with new images in the pipeline.

Hope has transitioned from a low 1,072 km orbit to a higher, science orbit on March 29, which gives the orbiter a good view of the seasonal transitions on the Red Planet. Along with data from other current Mars orbiters, we should be able to piece together the most detailed atlas yet, even before more helicopters will zip along Mars’ surface.",science,1
113,'Dark Earth' Buried in The Amazon's Past Could Help Save Its Future - ScienceAlert,https://www.sciencealert.com/dark-earth-buried-in-the-amazons-past-could-help-save-its-future,"The Amazon rainforest is on the precipice of a catastrophic collapse from which it may never return.

The traditional knowledge that once helped cultivate this precious ecosystem could now help it recover, according to new research by researchers from the University of São Paulo, the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation, and the National Institute for Amazonian Research in Brazil.

Roughly 2,000 to 2,500 years ago, the Amazonian people known today as the Amerindians took a nutrient-impoverished land and enriched it with compost, charcoal, bone, clay, and manure, creating a black, fertile soil called 'Amazonian dark earth' (ADE).

Today, dark earth soils nourish riverbanks and other regions of the Amazon with minerals like magnesium, zinc, phosphorous, and calcium, providing the perfect habitat for microorganisms. Beneficial to plant health and growth, it is why native people in the Amazon have planted food in dark soils for centuries.

At last, the scientific establishment is paying attention to that deep native knowledge.

A set of experiments on Amazonian dark earth suggests these ancient soils can greatly improve an ecosystem's transition from pasture to rainforest. The scientists behind the new research hope their findings can be used to speed up ecological restoration projects in the Amazon today.

""ADE has taken thousands of years to accumulate and would take an equal time to regenerate in nature if used,' says molecular biologist Siu Mui Tsai from the University of São Paulo.

""Our recommendations aren't to utilize ADE itself, but rather to copy its characteristics, particularly its microorganisms, for use in future ecological restoration projects.""

In pots with either control soil, 20 percent ADE and 80 percent control soil, or 100 percent ADE, the researchers grew grasses before cutting them back, leaving just their roots. They then planted the seeds of three types of tree and watched them grow for 90 days.

At the start of the experiments, the dark soil was less acidic and included more sand and silt than the control soil. It also contained 30 times more phosphorous, 6 times more calcium, 5 times more zinc, and 4 times more iron, carbon, and copper.

After the potted plants had time to grow, the soil was sapped of some nutrients. But pots containing dark earth were still much richer in minerals than the control soil.

Much of the deforestation that currently occurs in the Amazon is to make room for grazing cattle. But this pastureland is created at the expense of an irreplaceable ecosystem that stores huge amounts of carbon and supports a massive diversity of life forms.

Dark earth soil could go a long way towards recovering that lost habitat, even in a warming world. The soil mix containing only 20 percent dark soil was still hugely beneficial for tree growth in a temperature-controlled greenhouse. In fact, a small dose of genuine ADE mixed into degraded soil provided nearly as much plant growth as 100 percent ADE on its own under a mean temperature of 34ºC.

The microbial community hosted in dark soil was also more diverse compared to that in pots containing more degraded soil.

""Microbes transform chemical soil particles into nutrients that can be taken up by plants,"" explains University of São Paulo molecular biologist and joint lead author Anderson Santos de Freitas.

""Our data showed that [Amazonian dark earth] contains microorganisms that are better at this transformation of soils, thus providing more resources for plant development.""

In the experiments, for instance, grasses grew 3.4 times thicker in soil containing 20 percent ADE and 8 times thicker in pure ADE soil than in controls.

Some trees also grew three to six times taller when planted in soils containing ADE. The primary, or colonizing, species Ambay pumpwood (Cecropia pachystachya) wouldn't even grow if it didn't have access to ADE and its crucial minerals.

Without ADE, the findings suggest some trees in the Amazon may not take root at all.

Dark soil may be key to their recovery.

114,Scientists discover gigantic 'structure' under the surface of the Moon - indy100,https://www.indy100.com/science-tech/structure-under-moon-surface-scientists-2659988995,"The Moon has been a subject of awe and fascination for millennia, with its shape-shifting powers and enigmatic dark side.

And though it’s the one celestial body on which man has taken (small) steps, we still have big leaps to go in understanding its potential and uncovering its secrets.

However, one hidden feature of the Moon has been unearthed by scientists and it’s very, very big, and very, very heavy.

Buried beneath its South Pole-Aitken basin – one of the largest preserved craters in the Solar System – is a structure which weighs at least 2.18 billion kilogrammes and measures more than 300km (186 miles) in depth and 2,000km (1,243 miles) in length.

The researchers who made the discovery, all based in the US, posited that the “anomaly” could be made out of metal from the core of an asteroid or oxides from the crystallisation of a magma ocean.

""One of the explanations of this extra mass is that the metal from the asteroid that formed this crater is still embedded in the Moon's mantle,” lead author Peter B. James, from Houston’s Baylor University, said in a statement shared with IFLScience.

Illustrating just how gigantic this thing is, he went on: ""Imagine taking a pile of metal five times larger than the Big Island of Hawaii and burying it underground. That's roughly how much unexpected mass we detected.”

The groundbreaking finding was made thanks to NASA’s Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission, which measures changes in the Moon’s gravitational field.

Data collected by GRAIL can then be used to study the internal composition of our cratered companion.

115,Radical Idea Could Make Future Space Mission 100 Times More Powerful - ScienceAlert,https://www.sciencealert.com/radical-idea-could-make-future-space-mission-100-times-more-powerful,"The first-time detection of gravitational waves (GW) by researchers at the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) in 2015 triggered a revolution in astronomy. This phenomenon consists of ripples in spacetime caused by the merger of massive objects and was predicted a century prior by Einstein's theory of general relativity.

In the coming years, this burgeoning field will advance considerably thanks to the introduction of next-generation observatories, like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).

With greater sensitivity, astronomers will be able to trace GW events back to their source and use them to probe the interiors of exotic objects and the laws of physics. As part of their Voyage 2050 planning cycle, the European Space Agency (ESA) is considering mission themes that could be ready by 2050 – including GW astronomy.

In a recent paper, researchers from the ESA's Mission Analysis Section and the University of Glasgow presented a new concept that would build on LISA – known as LISAmax. As they report, this observatory could potentially improve GW sensitivity by two orders of magnitude.

The research was led by theoretical physicist Dr Waldemar Martens, a Mission Analyst at the ESA's European Space Operations Center (ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany. He was joined by aerospace engineer and astrophysicist Michael Khan, also a Missions Analyst at the ESOC, and astrophysicist Dr Jean-Baptiste Bayle, an astronomy and astrophysics research fellow with the University of Glasgow.

The paper that describes their findings appeared online recently and is currently being reviewed for publication by the journal Classical and Quantum Gravity.

frameborder=""0″ allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"" allowfullscreen>

Since they were first detected by LIGO scientists in 2015, researchers with LIGO and other observatories worldwide have refined the types of GW events they can detect. This includes the Virgo Observatory in Italy (near Pisa) and the Kamioka Gravitational Wave Detector (KAGRA) in Hida, Japan. These observatories have since partnered with LIGO, forming the Ligo-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration.

The efforts of these and other observatories, plus upgrades that have provided increased sensitivity, have multiplied the number of events detected and even traced some back to their sources.

As Dr Martens told Universe Today via email, this pioneering work has been invaluable. But like all forms of astronomy, future progress is dependent in part on having observatories in space:

""Now that there is no doubt that gravitational waves can be measured, astronomers want to use them as an additional source of information where previously only electromagnetic waves were available. Earth-based detectors, like LIGO/Virgo/Kagra are sensitive in the frequency range of tens of Hertz to several kilo-Hertz. This makes them sensitive to sources like black hole mergers of a few tens of solar masses. ""However, it is known that much larger objects, like supermassive black holes (>10^6 solar masses), exist in the center of galaxies. Mergers of these objects produce gravitational waves far below the sensitive band of Earth-based detectors. To see them, we have to go to space and construct an observatory, like LISA, that has an arm length of 2.5 million km.""

So far, astronomers have detected GW events caused by binary black holes (BBHs) or binary neutron stars (kilonova events), where the co-orbiting bodies eventually merged. It is also theorized that there are many other potential sources, and studying these events could advance our understanding of the Universe.

""Among those are primordial gravitational waves that were produced during processes a fraction of a second after the Big Bang,"" said Dr. Martens. ""We hope that LISA can detect those, but it is not clear yet. That's one of the reasons why detectors with higher sensitivity and/or different frequency bands are considered for Voyage 2050.""

The Voyage 2050 is the latest planning cycle to become part of the agency's scientific program, the foundation and the main ""mandatory program"" of the European Space Agency. All member states must contribute, and science goals, proposals, and funding are selected by unanimous decision.

These cycles aim to set a long-term funding horizon that allows member states to plan their priorities well in advance and provide the European scientific community with a clear vision of what research areas deserve investment and development.

Since the 1980s, the program has been planned with cycles of approximately 20 years, consistent with the amount of time necessary to prepare ambitious space missions.

The first planning cycle (Horizon 2000) was established in 1984 and consisted of decisions that led to the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), Cluster, Rosetta, XMM-Newton, and Herschel missions from the mid-1990s to the early 21st century. In 2005, a further planning cycle (Cosmic Vision) was launched, including mission proposals that would be realized between 2015 and 2025.

This prepared the way for missions like the recently launched JUpiter ICy moons Explorer (JUICE) and the Advanced Telescope for High Energy Astrophysics (ATHENA) X-ray observatory and LISA missions scheduled to launch by the 2030s.

The most recent cycle, Voyage 2050, was initiated by the ESA Director of Science Carole Mundell to select scientific properties to follow up on the ATHENA and LISA missions.

While these missions will be game-changing, especially in collaboration, Dr Martens and his colleagues propose ways in which the LISA mission could be enhanced further.

As he explained:

""The basic idea of LISAmax is to detect GWs at even lower frequencies than what LISA can do. To be sensitive to these frequencies, one must increase the laser arms of the detector. Larger arms mean larger wavelengths and, thus, lower frequencies. The three LISAmax spacecraft are placed close to the triangular Lagrange points in the Sun-Earth system, which gives the detector an arm length of 259 million km. For comparison, LISA's arms have a length of 2.5 million km. This makes LISAmax sensitive to GWs in the micro-Hertz band and opens a new window for GW astronomy. ""Generally speaking, whatever source can be measured by LISA below 1 mHz, can be measured with LISAmax at a signal-to-noise ratio that is about two orders of magnitude better. An example that is discussed in the paper is the inspiral phase of supermassive black hole binaries. While LISA will only be able to see such sources shortly before the final merger event, LISAmax can observe these objects thousands of years before, thus allowing for a much better measurement of certain parameters.""

The scientific community is investigating this concept, which could have drastic implications for the future of GW astronomy. In addition to expanding the range of GW events that could be detected, next-generation GW observatories can trace more events back to their sources.

On top of that, astronomers anticipate that GWs will allow them to explore the laws of physics, probe the interiors of extreme objects, and even aid in studying planets and satellites.

The proposal put forth by Dr Martens and his colleagues is one of several GW concepts submitted to the ESA for the Voyage 2050 program. These concepts include a space-based interferometer that would survey the sky for GWs in the millihertz to microhertz (mHz to µHz) frequency range.

Another proposes how interferometers sensitive to GWs in the mHz range could be used to learn more about the nature of black holes. Others show how observations in the decihertz (dHz) range could provide the ""missing link"" for GW astronomy, while high-angular astronomy could help trace GWs back to their source.

Research into the physics of the early Universe, which includes the study of primordial gravitational waves, is also a major theme of the ESA's Voyage 2050 program. By examining the GWs created during the inflationary epoch, scientists would finally be able to probe the physics and microphysics of this early cosmic period.

116,Electron rocket launches pair of cyclone-tracking CubeSats for NASA – Spaceflight Now - Spaceflight Now,https://spaceflightnow.com/2023/05/08/electron-rocket-launches-pair-of-cyclone-tracking-cubesats-for-nasa/,"The first pair of four NASA CubeSats designed to provide frequent updates of typhoon and hurricane development for new insights into how tropical storms evolve and intensify were launched by Rocket Lab from its New Zealand spaceport on Sunday.

The company’s Electron rocket — nicknamed “Rocket Like a Hurricane” — lifted off from its Mahia Peninsula launch site at 9 p.m. EDT (0100 UTC; 1 p.m. Monday local New Zealand time). Some 33 minutes after liftoff, the two shoebox-sized TROPICS CubeSats were deployed into low Earth orbit about 340 miles (550 kilometers) above the planet.

A kick stage, normally used on Electron launches to circularize orbits, performed flawlessly to place the satellites into orbits at an inclination of 32 degrees, a level of precision needed for successful operation of the storm monitoring payloads.

The TROPICS constellation (Time-Resolved Observations of Precipitation structure and storm Intensity with a Constellation of Smallsats) is part of NASA’s Earth System Science Pathfinder Program. Each pair of CubeSats has be launched to two specific orbital planes that are equally spaced 180 degrees opposite each other to maximize temporal resolution.

These unique orbits over Earth’s tropics allow the satellites to travel over any given storm about once an hour, compared with current weather tracking satellites that have a timing of about once every six hours. This high revisit rate aims to help scientists better understand the processes that effect these high-impact storms, ultimately leading to improved modeling and prediction to help protect lives and livelihoods.

All four TROPICS satellites need to be deployed into their operational orbit within a 60-day period, a mission requirement made possible with a small dedicated launcher like Electron. With the first batch of TROPICS CubeSats now safely in orbit, the second launch, called “Coming to a Storm Near You,” is expected on another Electron rocket in approximately two weeks from Launch Complex 1.

Sunday’s lifetoff, delayed from the previous weekend because of poor weather at the launch site, came 11 months after the first two satellites in the constellation were lost when an Astra rocket failed last June. The remaining four were subsequently switched to Rocket Lab, which could meet NASA’s requirement to have its TROPICS fleet operational in time for this year’s Northern Hemisphere stormy season.

“The TROPICS constellation has the real potential to save lives by providing more timely data about storm intensity and providing advance warning to those in storm paths, so it’s an immense privilege to have deployed these spacecraft to their precise orbits before the upcoming storm season,” said Peter Beck, Rocket Lab’s founder and CEO.

“We’re grateful to the NASA team for entrusting us with such a critical mission and we look forward to completing the constellation with the second Electron launch in the coming days,” Beck said.

Microwave radiometers on each of the TROPICS satellites are designed to collect imagery, temperature, and moisture data over tropical cyclones. With a fleet of four satellites, the TROPICS mission will be capable of monitoring rapid changes in cyclones at a cadence of at least once per hour.

William Blackwell, TROPICS principal investigator at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, said: “The ability to look in the microwave wavelength region in storms with hourly cadence as storms form and intensify means we’ll be getting data we’ve never had before. We hope to improve our understanding of the basic processes that drive such storms, and ultimately improve our ability to forecast the track and intensity.”

Provided the second launch is successful, NASA expects to have the four-satellite system in operation by the start of the Atlantic hurricane season this summer.

“Having four instead of the originally planned six does make a difference because revisit times will be 10 to 15 minutes longer,” Blackwell said. “But with four satellites, we’re still better than our nominal requirement of 60 minutes.”

The “Rocket Like a Hurricane” flight was Rocket Lab’s fourth mission for 2023, and the company’s 36th Electron mission overall. It brings the total number of satellites launched to orbit by the launch and space systems company to 161.

Rocket Lab, headquartered in Long Beach, California, was founded in 2006 and operates lightweight Electron orbital rockets for dedicated launches for small satellites. It is also planning a larger Neutron rocket, which could be flown for the first time as soon as next year.",science,1

This will lead to significant advancements in medical and other technological fields.

The findings, published in the journal Science Advances, hold enormous potential for the field of medical science. It presents a cost-effective and efficient method for examining objects that are too small to be seen by microscopes let alone the naked eye. This research could also have a positive impact on the semiconductor industry by enhancing the quality control process in the production of computer chips.

The ANU technology uses carefully engineered nanoparticles to increase the frequency of light that cameras and other technologies see by up to seven times. The researchers say there is “no limit” to how high the frequency of light can be increased. The higher the frequency, the smaller the object we are able to see using that light source.

The technology, which requires only a single nanoparticle to work, could be implemented into microscopes to help scientists zoom into the world of super small things at 10 times the resolution of conventional microscopes. This would enable researchers to study objects that would otherwise be too small to see, such as the inner structures of cells and individual viruses.

Being able to analyze such small objects could help scientists better understand and fight certain diseases and health conditions.

“Conventional microscopes are only able to study objects bigger than about a ten-millionth of a meter. However, there is growing demand across a range of sectors, including the medical field, to be able to analyze much smaller objects down to one billionth of a meter,” lead author Dr. Anastasiia Zalogina, from the ANU Research School of Physics and the University of Adelaide, said.

“Our technology could help meet that demand.”

The researchers say the ANU-developed nanotech could help create a new generation of microscopes that can produce much more detailed images.

“Scientists who want to generate a highly-magnified image of an extremely small, nanoscale object can’t use a conventional optical microscope. Instead, they must rely on either super-resolution microscopy techniques or use an electron microscope to study these tiny objects,” Dr. Zalogina said.

“But such techniques are slow and the technology is very expensive, often costing more than a million dollars.

“Another disadvantage of electron microscopy is that it may damage delicate samples being analyzed, whereas light-based microscopes mitigate this issue.”

Beams of light that we perceive as different colors of the rainbow are electromagnetic waves that oscillate with different frequencies.

What we see as red is the lowest frequency that our eyes can detect. Even lower frequencies not visible to the human eye are called infrared. Violet has the highest light frequency that we can see. Ultraviolet, which has an even higher frequency, is invisible to the human eye.

Although our eyes cannot detect infrared and ultraviolet light, it is possible for us to ‘see’ it using cameras and other technologies.

Co-author Dr. Sergey Kruk, also from ANU, said researchers are interested in achieving very high frequencies of light, also known as ‘extreme-ultraviolet’.

“With violet light, we can see much smaller things compared to using red light. And with extreme-ultraviolet light sources, we can see things beyond what’s possible using conventional microscopes of today,” Dr. Kruk said.

Dr. Kruk said the ANU technology could also be used in the semiconductor industry as a quality control measure to ensure a streamlined manufacturing process.

“Computer chips consist of very tiny components with feature sizes almost as small as one billionth of a meter. During the chip production process, it would be beneficial for manufacturers to use tiny sources of extreme-ultraviolet light to monitor this process in real-time to diagnose any problems early on,” he said.

“That way manufacturers could save resources and time on bad batches of chips, thereby increasing yields of chip manufacturing. It’s estimated that a one percent increase in yields of computer chip manufacturing translates into two billion dollars in savings.

“Australia’s booming optics and photonics industry is represented by nearly 500 companies and accounts for about $4.3 billion of economic activity, making our high-tech ecosystem well-positioned to adopt new types of light sources in order to reach new global markets in nanotechnology industries and research.”

119,Chasing SpaceX: The Commercial Space Race Gets a Reality Check - Universe Today,https://www.universetoday.com/161273/chasing-spacex-the-commercial-space-race-gets-a-reality-check/,"Can anyone keep up with SpaceX in the commercial space race?

It might be one of the four companies profiled in “When the Heavens Went on Sale” — a new book written by Ashlee Vance, the tech journalist who chronicled SpaceX founder Elon Musk’s feats and foibles eight years ago. Or it might be one of the dozens of other space ventures that have risen up to seek their fortune on the final frontier. Or maybe no one.

The space race’s ultimate prizes may still be up for grabs, but in Vance’s view, one thing is clear: There wouldn’t be a race if it weren’t for Musk and SpaceX.

“Elon sort of set this whole thing in motion,” Vance says in the latest episode of the Fiction Science podcast. “My book is more or less a story of people who want to be the next Elon Musk.”

“When the Heavens Went On Sale” focuses on four ventures: Planet Labs, which put shoebox-sized satellites into space to observe Earth to an unprecedented degree; Rocket Lab, a launch company founded in New Zealand by a self-taught rocketeer; Astra, which launches rockets from Alaska; and Firefly Aerospace, which won the backing of a controversial Ukrainian-born tech entrepreneur.

How did Vance choose those four? It all started with Rocket Lab.

“Some of my favorite reporting from the Elon book was SpaceX, especially in the early days, and getting all these stories of what it was like to make the Falcon 1,” he says. “As the book came out, I just happened to take a trip to New Zealand, and I saw there was this guy named Peter Beck and this company, Rocket Lab, making something quite similar to the Falcon 1. And it just struck me — not, like immediately — but I had the sense that, wow, this is pretty amazing.”

And the other three companies? “I kind of just went with my gut a little bit,” he says.

“When the Heavens Went On Sale” by Ashlee Vance (Ecco HarperCollins)

In the book, Vance tells the stories behind the creation of those space startups and their interconnections. Every story has its quirks: Beck, for example, got into rocketry as a hobbyist and first made his mark with a rocket bike that looked as if it came straight out of Evel Knievel’s garage. Now he’s the CEO of a billion-dollar company that just launched a weather-monitoring satellite mission for NASA.

Vance recounts how Planet Labs was started up by a “space hippie crew” with the guidance of Pete Worden — a former Air Force general who stirred up so much controversy during his time as the director of NASA’s Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley that he was accused of being part of a conspiracy to destroy America’s space program.

The author was given exclusive access to the behind-the-scenes turmoil (and tedium) surrounding the rise of Astra, which started out with the name “Stealth Space Company” and saw one of its rockets literally go sideways on Alaska’s Kodiak Island.

And then there’s Max Polyakov, the Ukrainian-born investor who poured more than $100 million into Firefly Aerospace — only to be forced by the federal government to sell off his interest due to worries that he might be a Russian asset.

“He’s an OBGYN turned software millionaire, turned rocket magnate, and is just this … one-of-a-kind, force of nature,” Vance says. “And so the story was really what happens when you put this ‘bull in a China shop’ in the aerospace industry. I knew I wanted to see what would happen. When I set out to do this, I knew things would get weird. I did not know how weird they would get.”

Vance actually traveled to Ukraine in 2018 to see the decrepit Soviet rocket factory that Firefly tried to revive. Last year, the war in Ukraine brought an end to that effort. “Any hopes for a revival of the Ukrainian aerospace industry were in the process of being obliterated, along with much of the country,” Vance writes in the book.

Today Vance sees the war in Ukraine as a turning point, not only for Polyakov’s fortunes, but also for space security.

“We have all kinds of stuff between Russia and China and the U.S., with satellites that can spit out baby satellites that can go grab other satellites, and people try to shoot down satellites just to show that they can and create all this debris,” Vance says. “A lot of this very clearly came to a head in Ukraine in the war, where I would suggest that’s the first space war, or the inkling of a space war, that we’ve seen.”

SpaceX’s Starlink constellation provided vital communications links, while satellite imagery from Planet Labs and other companies added to the assets available to Ukrainian intelligence analysts. “You had one of the three main traditional space superpowers, in Russia, get totally flipped on its head by commercial space,” Vance says. “Things are only going to get more chaotic, I think, as time goes on.”

Things have gotten less chaotic for Vance in at least one respect, however, having to do with his relations with Elon Musk. Vance says Musk wasn’t happy with some of the “less flattering stories” that were recounted in his biography.

“He didn’t talk to me for a long time,” Vance says. “And then I think, as they say, time heals all wounds. I don’t know exactly what happened, but I write about it in the book. He just called me out of the blue one day while I was in New Zealand reporting on Rocket Lab. And we’ve been talking since then.”

Vance acknowledges that Musk’s $44 billion purchase of Twitter, and all the twists and turns that led to, have had a polarizing effect. “People seem to either love him or hate him, and I think it’s a bit silly if you actually know him and spend time with him,” he says. “Like anyone, he’s a nuanced person, in person. He is not the Twitter Elon.”

What about the SpaceX Elon? “In some ways, the Space Elon is the easiest Elon to understand, which is surprising in some sense,” Vance says. “I mean, SpaceX is almost like the most stable thing in his life — which you usually cannot say for rocket companies.”

If SpaceX’s super-heavy-lift Starship launch system lives up to its promise, that will give Musk an even bigger lead.

So, back to the first question: Can anyone keep up with SpaceX? Based on the current state of the commercial space industry, Vance sees one potential rival, and it’s not Blue Origin or United Launch Alliance:

“SpaceX does look just incredibly dominant at this moment. If you’re talking about getting satellites to space, it’s like SpaceX and Rocket Lab. That’s it. So you’ve got one company that’s done hundreds of launches, another that’s done dozens, and then very quickly you drop off to one or two, and most of those rockets are being rebuilt and refashioned. So there’s kind of two games in town. “The Starship thing is interesting. Does it take longer than Elon expects and give Rocket Lab time to [build] a bigger rocket? Does that give it time to catch up to the Falcon 9? Does Rocket Lab become sort of this, whatever you want to call it, the IBM to SpaceX’s Apple, where you have these two competitors? I think something like that could happen. “I also think .. we’re going to have this retrenching, and then there’s going be another stab at this where we try to correct some of the mistakes that came before. … If all these spreadsheets are correct and we are to send up 200,000 satellites in, call it the next 10 or 12 years, not even SpaceX really would be able to meet that demand. And I don’t think the rest of the world would tolerate having just one company doing all this. … This is the dominant question hanging over this whole industry: How many rockets do we need?”

120,Mysterious 'golden' fossils from the Jurassic aren't what they seem - Livescience.com,https://www.livescience.com/animals/extinct-species/mysterious-golden-fossils-from-the-jurassic-arent-what-they-seem,"It was long thought that pyrite — a shiny mineral also known as fool's gold — was the special ingredient that gave fossils embedded in Germany's Posidonia Shale their golden glow. But now scientists think something else is causing these fossils to shimmer.

Earlier this year, a team of international researchers visited the Early Jurassic site known for its exceptionally well-preserved fossils of marine animals. They collected dozens of samples of fossilized ammonites, bivalves and crustaceans that were about palm-size or larger.

Once the team viewed the roughly 183 million-year-old fossils using a high-powered scanning electron microscope, they struggled to find any pyrite in the fossils poking out of the black shale, according to a study published in the March 2023 edition of the journal Earth-Science Reviews (opens in new tab).

""It was long believed that everything [at the Posidonia Shale] was pyritized,"" study co-author Rowan Martindale (opens in new tab), an associate professor in the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Texas (UT) at Austin, told Live Science. ""We picked samples that we thought for sure would be all pyrite. And lo and behold there was a little bit of pyrite on a couple of them, but basically it was all phosphatized or yellow calcite. It was pretty much a shock to all of us who worked on the paper.""

After analyzing roughly 70 specimens, it was clear that while the shale surrounding the fossils was ""dotted with microscopic clusters of pyrite crystals, called framboids,"" it was phosphate minerals with yellow calcite that were the source of the fossils' golden glow, according to a statement (opens in new tab).

Related: Trilobites had a hidden third eye, new fossils reveal

""The framboids look like tiny raspberries,"" study co-author Sinjini Sinha (opens in new tab), a doctoral candidate in the Jackson School of Geosciences at UT, told Live Science. ""After looking at the specimens under a microscope, I only found a few framboids on the fossils themselves but counted 600 to 800 on the surrounding shale.""

Knowing that pyrite and phosphate are present in different parts of the specimens is crucial since it reveals information about the fossilization environment. For example, pyrite forms in anoxic environments where there's no oxygen present, whereas phosphate minerals like yellow calcite need oxygen to form, according to the statement.

""The pyritization process only takes place in anoxic environments,"" study co-author James Schiffbauer (opens in new tab), an associate professor of geological sciences at the University of Missouri, told Live Science. ""These [specimens] are found in dark, black shales where we expected this to be an anoxic environment.""

The research revealed that even though an anoxic seafloor ""set the stage for fossilization,"" it took a burst of oxygen to cause the chemical reactions necessary for fossilization to occur. The oxygenation combined with the phosphate minerals helped turn the fossils into what looks like gold, according to the statement.",science,1
121,Mankind's Missing Puzzle Pieces: The “Deleted” Genes That Made Us Human - SciTechDaily,https://scitechdaily.com/mankinds-missing-puzzle-pieces-the-deleted-genes-that-made-us-human/,"Researchers from Yale and the Broad Institute discovered that the loss of about 10,000 fragments of genetic information differentiates humans from our closest primate relatives. These conserved deletions, associated with cognitive functions and brain cell formation, suggest an evolutionary advantage, altering the function of our genes and potentially contributing to our unique human characteristics.

What the human genome is lacking compared with the genomes of other primates might have been as crucial to the development of humankind as what has been added during our evolutionary history, according to a new study led by researchers at Yale and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.

The new findings, published recently in the journal Science, fill an important gap in what is known about historical changes to the human genome. While a revolution in the capacity to collect data from genomes of different species has allowed scientists to identify additions that are specific to the human genome — such as a gene that was critical for humans to develop the ability to speak — less attention has been paid to what’s missing in the human genome.

For the new study researchers used an even deeper genomic dive into primate DNA to show that the loss of about 10,000 bits of genetic information — most as small as a few base pairs of DNA — over the course of our evolutionary history differentiate humans from chimpanzees, our closest primate relative. Some of those “deleted” pieces of genetic information are closely related to genes involved in neuronal and cognitive functions, including one associated with the formation of cells in the developing brain.

These 10,000 missing pieces of DNA — which are present in the genomes of other mammals — are common to all humans, the Yale team found.

The fact that these genetic deletions became conserved in all humans, the authors say, attests to their evolutionary importance, suggesting that they conferred some biological advantage.

“Often we think new biological functions must require new pieces of DNA, but this work shows us that deleting genetic code can result in profound consequences for traits make us unique as a species,” said Steven Reilly, an assistant professor of genetics at Yale School of Medicine and senior author of the paper.

The paper was one of several published in the journal Science from the Zoonomia Project, an international research collaboration that is cataloging the diversity in mammalian genomes by comparing DNA sequences from 240 species of mammals that exist today.

In their study, the Yale team found that some genetic sequences found in the genomes of most other mammal species, from mice to whales, vanished in humans. But rather than disrupt human biology, they say, some of these deletions created new genetic encodings that eliminated elements that would normally turn genes off.

The deletion of this genetic information, Reilly said, had an effect that was the equivalent of removing three characters — “n’t” — from the word “isn’t” to create a new word, “is.”

“[Such deletions] can tweak the meaning of the instructions of how to make a human slightly, helping explain our bigger brains and complex cognition,” he said.

The researchers used a technology called Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRA), which can simultaneously screen and measure the function of thousands of genetic changes among species.

“These tools have the capability to allow us to start to identify the many small molecular building blocks that make us unique as a species,” Reilly said.

122,"4 of Uranus' biggest moons have secret, underground oceans, new study suggests - Livescience.com",https://www.livescience.com/space/uranus/4-of-uranus-biggest-moons-have-secret-underground-oceans-new-study-suggests,"Hidden oceans may lurk under the icy crusts of four of Uranus' moons.

Scientists recently reanalyzed data from the Voyager spacecraft that flew by Uranus in the 1980s and found that four of Uranus' largest moons — Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon — may be warm enough to host liquid oceans. In Titania and Oberon, these oceans might even be warm enough to potentially support life, according to a recent study in the Journal of Geophysical Research (opens in new tab).

""When it comes to small bodies — dwarf planets and moons — planetary scientists previously have found evidence of oceans in several unlikely places, including the dwarf planets Ceres and Pluto, and Saturn's moon Mimas,"" study lead author Julie Castillo-Rogez (opens in new tab) of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California said in a statement (opens in new tab). ""So there are mechanisms at play that we don't fully understand.""

The new study integrated 1980s Voyager 2 data with information on other icy moons such as Pluto's Charon and Saturn's Enceladus drawn from more recent NASA missions such as Galileo, Cassini, Dawn, and New Horizons. Uranus has 27 moons, but the researchers focused on the five largest, which are Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, Oberon and Miranda. Of these, Ariel is the smallest at 720 miles (1,160 kilometers) across, while Titania is the largest at 980 miles (1,580 km) across.

Previously, scientists thought only Tatiana was likely to generate any internal heat via radioactive decay — the process by which unstable atoms lose energy through radiation — believing the other moons to be too small. However, modeling the other moons' porosity suggested that all but Miranda are insulated enough to retain internal heat created by radioactive decay. The researchers also found that any potential oceans beneath the icy crusts of these moons would be rich in chlorides, ammonia and salts, both of which would lower the freezing point of the water. The combination of a low freezing point and enough internal heat could mean that Ariel, Umbrial, Titania and Oberon all have oceans dozens of miles deep within their interiors, the researchers reported.

In 2020, scientists detected some evidence of recent geological activity on Ariel (opens in new tab), suggesting the possible movement of a potential inner ocean. Miranda also has surface features that look relatively fresh, according to the researchers, but their modeling suggests that if the moon did have a liquid ocean at some point, it is likely frozen by now.

To find out if these hidden oceans really exist, scientists will have to get creative. Spectrometers that can detect wavelengths of light reflected by ammonia and chlorides could help prove the presence of these chemicals under the crusts. Scientists could also use instruments that can detect electrical currents carried by liquid water to probe beneath these moons' surfaces. New modeling studies on how these moons formed could also help researchers plan what kind of observations they will need to make in the future, Castillo-Rogez said.

""We need to develop new models for different assumptions on the origin of the moons in order to guide planning for future observations,"" she said.",science,1
123,JPL's Snake-Like EELS Slithers Into New Robotics Terrain - NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory,https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/jpls-snake-like-eels-slithers-into-new-robotics-terrain,"How do you create a robot that can go places no one has ever seen before – on its own, without real-time human input? A team at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory that’s creating a snake-like robot for traversing extreme terrain is taking on the challenge with the mentality of a startup: Build quickly, test often, learn, adjust, repeat.

Called EELS (short for Exobiology Extant Life Surveyor), the self-propelled, autonomous robot was inspired by a desire to look for signs of life in the ocean hiding below the icy crust of Saturn’s moon Enceladus by descending narrow vents in the surface that spew geysers into space. Although testing and development continue, designing for such a challenging destination has resulted in a highly adaptable robot. EELS could pick a safe course through a wide variety of terrain on Earth, the Moon, and far beyond, including undulating sand and ice, cliff walls, craters too steep for rovers, underground lava tubes, and labyrinthine spaces within glaciers.

“It has the capability to go to locations where other robots can’t go. Though some robots are better at one particular type of terrain or other, the idea for EELS is the ability to do it all,” said JPL’s Matthew Robinson, EELS project manager. “When you’re going places where you don’t know what you’ll find, you want to send a versatile, risk-aware robot that’s prepared for uncertainty – and can make decisions on its own.”",science,1

The large space rock is called 2023 CL3 and it's estimated to be up to 656 feet wide.

Nasa has listed the asteroid on its Earth Close Approaches list.

That's a table full of space rocks that need to be kept under investigation.

This includes Asteroid 2023 CL3, which is more than twice as big as the Statue of Liberty.

New York's famous landmark stands at 305 feet when you include the base and 151 feet when you only include the female figure.

An asteroid of that size could do some serious damage if it were to collide with Earth.

That's why if an asteroid comes within 4.65million miles and is larger than a certain size, it's considered ""potentially hazardous"" by cautious space agencies.

Asteroid 2023 CL3 is expected to pass Earth on May 24 at a distance of just under 4.5million miles away.

That may sound pretty far away but in the grand scheme of space, this isn't a large distance at all.

It's estimated that the large asteroid will shoot past us safely at more than 16,000 miles per hour.

PLANS TO SAVE EARTH FROM ASTEROIDS

Some experts are worried that Earth isn't yet ready to defend itself from potentially deadly asteroids.

SpaceX CEO Elon Musk once sparked concern by tweeting: ""a big rock will hit Earth eventually & we currently have no defense.""

Nasa is looking into some defense methods though.

That's why it launched its Double Asteroid Redirection Test mission last year.

125,NASA Isn't Giving Up on Troubled Water-Hunting Moon Cubesat - Gizmodo,https://gizmodo.com/nasa-troubled-water-hunting-lunar-flashlight-1850415667,"For nearly five months, teams behind NASA’s Lunar Flashlight mission have been trying to get the briefcase-sized satellite to fire up its thrusters and get on the right orbital track around the Moon. There’s now some hope with one of the thrusters showing some improvement as work continues on the remaining three.

The Lunar Flashlight’s operations team has developed a new method to get the satellite’s propulsion system up and running, with the spacecraft needing more thrust within the next few days so that it can reach its revised orbit, NASA wrote in a blogpost on Friday.

Team members at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in southern California, Georgia Tech, and the space agency’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, are all working together on the new strategy, which involves “increasing fuel pump pressure far beyond the system’s operational limit while opening and closing the system’s valves,” according to NASA. The objective of this method is to attempt to remove any blockages from the thruster’s fuel lines, enabling the spacecraft to produce adequate thrust for carrying out monthly flybys of the Moon’s south polar region.

The mission engineers’ latest attempt focused on one of the cubesat’s thrusters and they are now attempting it on the other three. “This has resulted in limited success, with the remaining thrusters inconsistently producing some increased levels of thrust,” NASA wrote in the blogpost.



Lunar Flashlight launched aboard a Falcon 9 rocket alongside Japan’s Hakuto-R lunar lander mission in December 2022. Sadly, the Japanese private lander crashed on the Moon in April , failing to fulfill its mission. Its payload companion, on the other hand, is still trying to carry out its own mission.

Shortly after its launch, Lunar Flashlight ran into some trouble when three of its four thrusters began to underperform on account of those obstructed fuel lines. Lunar Flashlight was supposed to enter a near-rectilinear halo orbit around the Moon, but with the thruster problems, NASA hatched a plan to place the probe in a high Earth orbit instead, allowing it to scan the Moon’s south polar regions once per month, as opposed to the original plan of once per week.

The cubesat is currently more than half a million miles away from Earth and looping its way back toward our planet. Meanwhile, the mission team is trying to nudge the Lunar Flashlight into a “trajectory that will allow it to arrive in the required Earth-Moon orbit,” according to NASA.



The Lunar Flashlight is designed to shine infrared light on some of the Moon’s permanently shadowed regions, scanning the lunar South Pole for reservoirs of ice water hidden away from the Sun’s light. The small spacecraft is using a new kind of propulsion system as a technology demonstration in space, which always carries its own risk for the mission itself.

“Technology demonstrations are high-risk, high-reward endeavors intended to push the frontiers of space technology,” NASA wrote. “The lessons learned from these challenges will help to inform future missions that advance this technology.”

127,Resurfaced Nikola Tesla writings about machines with their 'own mind' eerily predict rise of AI - Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/resurfaced-nikola-tesla-writings-about-machines-with-their-own-mind-eerily-predict-rise-of-ai,"Century-old writings by American inventor Nikola Tesla seem to predict the development of artificial intelligence, foreshadowing the rise of the groundbreaking tech.

The technology and electricity pioneer's scientific brilliance set him up to make eerily accurate predictions, including prescient insight into the emergence of machines with their ""own mind.""

""I purpose to show that, however impossible it may now seem, an automaton may be contrived which will have its ‘own mind,’"" Tesla wrote in June 1900,"" and by this I mean that it will be able, independent of any operator, left entirely to itself, to perform, in response to external influences affecting its sensitive organs, a great variety of acts and operations as if it had intelligence.""

The comments were published in ""The Century Magazine"" in an essay titled ""The Problem of Increasing Human Energy.""

Tesla, born in the Austrian Empire in 1856 before he moved to the U.S. in his late 20s, is famed for his inventions such as hydroelectric power, the Tesla coil, and his work on developing a radio. He is also famed for various predictions on the future of humanity, such as the creation of wireless technology and even describing modern day cellphones.

FLASHBACK: STEPHEN HAWKING WARNED AI COULD MEAN THE 'END OF THE HUMAN RACE' IN YEARS LEADING UP TO HIS DEATH

The resurfaced essay has been described as Tesla’s ""philosophical treatise"" where he used his research and genius to explain ""how to satisfy humanity’s increasing need for energy,"" according to the Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe, which is located in New York and ""dedicated to preserving and promoting the legacy of Nikola Tesla.""

""It will be able to follow a course laid out or to obey orders given far in advance; it will be capable of distinguishing between what it ought and what it ought not to do, and of making experiences or, otherwise stated, of recording impressions which will definitely affect its subsequent actions,"" Tesla wrote.

Tesla’s commentary viewed today seems to be a forecast on what the world today calls artificial intelligence, which is commonly understood as machines that are able to simulate human intelligence and carry out various tasks based on prompts by humans.

‘FATHER OF AI’ SAYS TECH FEARS MISPLACED: ‘YOU CANNOT STOP IT’

""Tesla did foresee an age of machines thinking independently of humans,"" Joseph Sikorski, a History & Collection Committee Member at the Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe, told Fox News Digital.

""Perhaps his most famous example is his teleautomaton, a remote-controlled boat that contained the fundamental patents for radio, robotics and the Nano A.N.D. gate- a primitive logic gate which is a fundamental part in every computer.""

HONORING THE LEGACY OF AMERICAN PHYSICIST AND ENGINEER NIKOLA TESLA

Two years before Tesla penned ""The Problem of Increasing Human Energy,"" he developed the world’s first radio-controlled boat, which is seen as paving the path for modern-day drones.

Sikorski, a renowned Tesla researcher and filmmaker, pointed to a letter Tesla wrote Purdue University professor Benjamin Franklin Miessner in the 1890s, where Tesla explained he never limited himself ""to mechanisms controlled from distance but to machines possessed of their own intelligence.""

""Since that time I had advanced greatly in the evolution of the invention and think that the time is not distant when I shall show an automaton which, left to itself, will act as though possessed of reason and without any willful control from the outside. Whatever be the practical possibilities of such an achievement, it will mark the beginning of a new epoch in mechanics,"" Tesla continued.

AI COULD GO 'TERMINATOR,' GAIN UPPER HAND OVER HUMANS IN DARWINIAN RULES OF EVOLUTION, REPORT WARNS

Sikorski told Fox News Digital that Tesla described the telautomaton as having a ""borrowed mind.""

""This perhaps better illustrates the potential benefits, yet dangers of unrestricted A.I,- for where the mind is 'borrowed' from could make all the difference, since it will be built upon the work of human beings who may be unable to contain their inherent flaws or biases,"" Sikorski said.

2 LETTERS BY NIKOLA TESLA SURFACE IN SERBIA

The release of OpenAI’s chatbot ChatGPT last year launched technology communities across the world into a race to develop more powerful AI systems. The chatbot is trained to mimic human conversation by absorbing mass amounts of text – including everything from news articles and websites to books – and generate responses to human users through patterns in data it learned.

Some tech leaders and experts have publicly denounced the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence, with many critics concerned with how AI could surpass human intelligence.

""I have suddenly switched my views on whether these things are going to be more intelligent than us,"" Geoffrey Hinton, known as the ""godfather of AI"" told MIT Technology Review this month. ""I think they’re very close to it now and they will be much more intelligent than us in the future…. How do we survive that?""

Tesla is credited for accurately predicting a handful of other technological advances currently in use today, such as tech that could transmit data wirelessly, also known as the internet, the BBC previously reported.

He even made a prediction in a 1926 interview with Collier's magazine about ""vest-pocket"" technology that's credited as Tesla foreseeing the creation of cellphones.

""When wireless is perfectly applied the whole earth will be converted into a huge brain, which in fact it is, all things being particles of a real and rhythmic whole. We shall be able to communicate with one another instantly, irrespective of distance,"" Tesla told Collier’s in the 1926 interview.

""Not only this, but through television and telephony we shall see and hear one another as perfectly as though we were face to face, despite intervening distances of thousands of miles; and the instruments through which we shall be able to do his will be amazingly simple compared with our present telephone. A man will be able to carry one in his vest pocket,"" he continued.",technology,1
129,Hollow Knight: Silksong has been delayed - The Verge,https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/9/23717855/hollow-knight-silksong-delayed,"We’ll be waiting a little while longer for Hollow Knight: Silksong. The years-in-the-making sequel to the excellent Hollow Knight was supposed to release within 12 months of the 2022 Xbox June showcase, but a representative for the game said Tuesday evening that the title will be missing that release window.

“We had planned to release in the 1st half of 2023, but development is still continuing,” Matthew Griffin, who works on marketing and publishing for the game, posted on Twitter. “We’re excited by how the game is shaping up, and it’s gotten quite big, so we want to take the time to make the game as good as we can. Expect more details from us once we get closer to release.”

Silksong, which features the character Hornet from Hollow Knight, was originally set to be Hollow Knight DLC, but developer Team Cherry announced the game would be a “full-scale sequel” in 2019. Nintendo showed off some gameplay during E3 2019, but we didn’t hear much from developers Team Cherry for a few years after. We got a new trailer and that now-broken release window at the Xbox show in June, and in September, Sony announced the game would be coming to PlayStation.",technology,1
131,"Microsoft Patch Tuesday, May 2023 Edition – Krebs on Security - Krebs on Security",https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/05/microsoft-patch-tuesday-may-2023-edition/,"Microsoft today released software updates to fix at least four dozen security holes in its Windows operating systems and other software, including patches for two zero-day vulnerabilities that are already being exploited in active attacks.

First up in May’s zero-day flaws is CVE-2023-29336, which is an “elevation of privilege” weakness in Windows which has a low attack complexity, requires low privileges, and no user interaction. However, as the SANS Internet Storm Center points out, the attack vector for this bug is local.

“Local Privilege escalation vulnerabilities are a key part of attackers’ objectives,” said Kevin Breen, director of cyber threat research at Immersive Labs. “Once they gain initial access they will seek administrative or SYSTEM-level permissions. This can allow the attacker to disable security tooling and deploy more attacker tools like Mimikatz that lets them move across the network and gain persistence.”

The zero-day patch that has received the most attention so far is CVE-2023-24932, which is a Secure Boot Security Feature Bypass flaw that is being actively exploited by “bootkit” malware known as “BlackLotus.” A bootkit is dangerous because it allows the attacker to load malicious software before the operating system even starts up.

According to Microsoft’s advisory, an attacker would need physical access or administrative rights to a target device, and could then install an affected boot policy. Microsoft gives this flaw a CVSS score of just 6.7, rating it as “Important.”

Adam Barnett, lead software engineer at Rapid7, said CVE-2023-24932 deserves a considerably higher threat score.

“Microsoft warns that an attacker who already has Administrator access to an unpatched asset could exploit CVE-2023-24932 without necessarily having physical access,” Barnett said. “Therefore, the relatively low CVSSv3 base score of 6.7 isn’t necessarily a reliable metric in this case.”

Barnett said Microsoft has provided a supplementary guidance article specifically calling out the threat posed by BlackLotus malware, which loads ahead of the operating system on compromised assets, and provides attackers with an array of powerful evasion, persistence, and Command & Control (C2) techniques, including deploying malicious kernel drivers, and disabling Microsoft Defender or Bitlocker.

“Administrators should be aware that additional actions are required beyond simply applying the patches,” Barnett advised. “The patch enables the configuration options necessary for protection, but administrators must apply changes to UEFI config after patching. The attack surface is not limited to physical assets, either; Windows assets running on some VMs, including Azure assets with Secure Boot enabled, also require these extra remediation steps for protection. Rapid7 has noted in the past that enabling Secure Boot is a foundational protection against driver-based attacks. Defenders ignore this vulnerability at their peril.”

In addition to the two zero-days fixed this month, Microsoft also patched five remote code execution (RCE) flaws in Windows, two of which have notably high CVSS scores.

CVE-2023-24941 affects the Windows Network File System, and can be exploited over the network by making an unauthenticated, specially crafted request. Microsoft’s advisory also includes mitigation advice. The CVSS for this vulnerability is 9.8 – the highest of all the flaws addressed this month.

Meanwhile, CVE-2023-28283 is a critical bug in the Windows Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) that allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute malicious code on the vulnerable device. The CVSS for this vulnerability is 8.1, but Microsoft says exploiting the flaw may be tricky and unreliable for attackers.

Another vulnerability patched this month that was disclosed publicly before today (but not yet seen exploited in the wild) is CVE-2023-29325, a weakness in Microsoft Outlook and Explorer that can be exploited by attackers to remotely install malware. Microsoft says this vulnerability can be exploited merely by viewing a specially-crafted email in the Outlook Preview Pane.

“To help protect against this vulnerability, we recommend users read email messages in plain text format,” Microsoft’s writeup on CVE-2023-29325 advises.

“If an attacker were able to exploit this vulnerability, they would gain remote access to the victim’s account, where they could deploy additional malware,” Immersive’s Breen said. “This kind of exploit will be highly sought after by e-crime and ransomware groups where, if successfully weaponized, could be used to target hundreds of organizations with very little effort.”

132,Northern lights could be visible in parts of the U.S. Wednesday due to geomagnetic storm - CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/northern-lights-visible-geomagnetic-storm-parts-u-s-wednesday/,"A Sunday solar flare means auroras could be visible in parts of the U.S. and Canada on Wednesday, weather officials said.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Space Weather Prediction Center raised geomagnetic storm watches for Wednesday and Thursday. The solar flare was associated with a partial coronal mass ejection, which is a large expulsion of plasma and magnetic field lines from the Sun's corona — the outermost part of its atmosphere. If the CME arrives as anticipated, G2, or moderate, storm conditions are expected Wednesday with G1, or minor, conditions Thursday.

Solar flares can cause radio blackouts, according to the NOAA.

The geomagnetic activity is also likely to make the northern lights visible. According to the NOAA, the aurora may be visible in the northern tier of the U.S., such as northern Michigan and Maine, on Wednesday night. It may also be seen as low as New York, Wisconsin, and Washington state. The lights may also be seen in Alaska and parts of Canada.

Aurora visibility forecast for May 10, 2023 NOAA

For the best chance of seeing the northern lights, head to a place with low light pollution and clear skies. The NOAA has a nightly forecast for the lights. Experts say space weather is tricky to forecast, so there are no guarantees.

Astronomy fans could start seeing the northern lights more often than usual going forward, NOAA space scientist Rob Steenburgh said in April. Sun activity is expected to steadily increase, which means more opportunities to see the aurora.

A new solar cycle began late in 2019, according to NASA. New cycles happen about every 11 years when the Sun flips its magnetic poles. The current cycle, Solar Cycle 25, is expected to be most active in mid-2024.",technology,1

From May 9 to May 22, players will be able to queue up and compete as either the Watcher rebels or the Infinite Empire in a new limited-time game mode called Starwatch: Galactic Rescue. Those fighting for freedom will need to escort the rebel leader Bonebreaker (aka Doomfist) as he seeks to free the imprisoned droid 3CH-0 (aka Echo) from the clutches of the empire. The rebels will need to hold various capture points, but it won't be easy. Players on the side of the Infinite Empire, led by Galactic Emperor Sigma and aided by security turrets, will be there to hold the line. Completing event challenges will unlock various cosmetics, like the Asteroid Wrecking Ball skin, a weapon charm, and more.

While the event is the star of the space-themed update, various balance changes have also been introduced to many of the game's heroes. As detailed in the official patch notes, those changes include a damage buff to Orisa's primary weapon, a Biotic Grenade healing nerf for Ana, and an increase to the damage radius of Winston's Jet Pack ability.

Junker Queen has seen perhaps the largest number of changes, having her maximum ammo increased, the projectile size of her throwing knife increased, an increase to the passive healing multiplier of Adrenaline Rush, and changes to Rampage so that it now deals 40 impact damage and less wound damage. Other heroes who have been slightly adjusted include Baptiste, whose Immortality Field has had its cooldown decreased, and Lifeweaver, who can no longer Life Grip Reinhardt's in the middle of using their ultimate.

Blizzard has additionally introduced a number of hero-specific options and settings to allow players the ability to ""custom-tailor"" their experience playing their favorite heroes. Many of those options allow for the ability to hide timers or elements of the UI for specific characters, or give players an option between holding down a key to use certain abilities. In total, 27 of the game's 37 heroes now have at least one hero-specific option that players can experiment with.

Overwatch 2's fourth season kicked off on April 11, introducing a new support hero, Lifeweaver, into the fold. Blizzard sought to make improvements to the character shortly after his arrival, with Lifeweaver receiving a rework to how his platforms are controlled alongside a buff to his ultimate, Tree of Life. You can read the full patch notes for Overwatch 2's Starwatch update below.

Overwatch 2 Starwatch Update Patch Notes

EVENT UPDATES

New Event - Starwatch: Galactic Rescue

Battle for the fate of the galaxy in this new four-point Assault mode. Side with the Watcher rebels alongside the mighty Bonebreaker to rescue 3CH-0 from the Infinite Galactrius starship. Or serve the Infinite Empire and use the starship's security systems to defend against the intruders. Your choice will decide the fate of the galaxy, for whichever side wins more battles by the end of the event will reign supreme!

Complete event challenges to unlock limited-time cosmetics, like the Asteroid Wrecking Ball epic skin, as well as up to 50,000 Battle Pass XP.

Battle for Olympus Returns

To celebrate Zeus Junker Queen's victory from Season 2's Battle for Olympus event, we are bringing back the game mode for a limited-time, including an all new Team Deathmatch version! To further commemorate the victors of Season 2, a statue of the god herself has been erected in Ilios.

GENERAL UPDATES

Ping System

""Group Up"" can now be used while dead.

Added a new setting to Controls -> Communication -> Ping - Options -> Enable Contextual Comms Wheel. When Enabled, this setting changes ""Group Up"" and ""Need Healing"" to use alternate comms when aiming at allies. This setting is ""Off"" by default.

Junker Queen can now ping targets through surfaces that her knife is stuck in, in the same way that Zenyatta can ping targets his Discord is attached to.

Push Game Mode Update

The respawn time for players is increased by 2 seconds from 10s to 12s while their team’s forward spawn location is activated.

Developer Comments: Forward spawn locations were proving to be too advantageous for the team with the lead, making it a bit too difficult for the disadvantaged team to mount a comeback.

Matchmaking

MMR decay system has received multiple improvements aimed at more quickly and accurately re-calibrating players when they return from a long period of inactivity.

COMPETITIVE UPDATES

The 2023 Competitive Deathmatch season begins on May 16th!

HERO UPDATES

TANK

JUNKER QUEEN

Developer Comments: These changes increase Junker Queen's front-line presence by increasing her self-healing and offensive sustainability. We've also increased Jagged Blade's projectile size so it's more consistent to land.

Scattergun

Maximum ammo increased from 6 to 8

Jagged Blade

Projectile size increased from 0.15 to 0.20 meters

Rampage

Now deals 40 impact damage

Wound damage decreased from 100 to 60

Adrenaline Rush

Adrenaline passive healing multiplier increased from 1.25 to 2x damage dealt by wounds

ORISA

Developer Comments: Orisa often gets a lot of value with her abilities, but she is underperforming compared to other tanks. Increasing her weapon damage will make her more of an immediate threat after closing the distance with the enemy team.

Augmented Fusion Driver

Damage increased from 12 to 13

WINSTON

Developer Comments: It's difficult to deal full damage with Winston's leap due to needing to land almost directly on the enemy hero. Increasing this range will improve its consistency.

Jet Pack

Damage radius before falloff begins increased from 1 to 1.3 meters

WRECKING BALL

Developer Comments: Adaptive Shields gives Wrecking Ball a lot of leeway in a fight due to its duration. This change to Adaptive Shields limits his survivability during prolonged engagements.

Adaptive Shield

Effect duration decreased from 9 to 7 seconds

DAMAGE

ECHO

Developer Comments: The following changes increase the flexibility of Echo’s Duplicate ultimate and shift some of its focus away from the allure of building multiple copied ultimates in a single use. This puts more of an emphasis on choosing a Duplicate target based on the hero's overall utility for a given situation, with the benefit of increased survivability due to transforming. Echo will get her ultimate more frequently but it will be more difficult to generate the copied hero’s ultimate.

Duplicate

Ultimate cost reduced 25%

Ultimate generation decreased from 5.5x to 4x while Duplicate is active

JUNKRAT

Developer Comments: The previous adjustment to Concussion Mine's maximum damage lowered the effectiveness of Junkrat's grenade and mine combos too much so we are increasing the damage amount slightly.

Concussion Mine

Maximum damage increased from 100 to 110

SUPPORT

ANA

Developer Comments: Ana’s survivability has improved significantly ever since the addition of the support passive. We are reducing the amount of healing provided by the Biotic Grenade explosion as she doesn’t need to rely on it for self-healing as much as before.

Biotic Grenade

Explosion healing decreased from 100 to 60

BAPTISTE

Developer Comments: Immortality Field provides powerful utility, but its long cooldown means that Baptiste often has to wait for the perfect opportunity to use it. We're decreasing its cooldown slightly to promote more flexibility in usage, though it will still be uncommon to see it in more than once per engagement.

Immortality Field

Cooldown decreased from 25 to 23 seconds

KIRIKO

Developer Comments: Kiriko sometimes accidentally interrupts her Kunai reload with Ofuda. Kunai now reloads slightly sooner during the animation to mitigate this. In addition, there is now a hero option, ""Healing Ofuda Cancels Reload,"" which can be turned off to bypass this issue entirely.

Kunai

Kunai reloads after 65% percent of the animation has completed (formerly 75%)

New Hero option: ""Healing Ofuda Cancels Reload""

LIFEWEAVER

Developer Comments: Earthshatter is an ultimate where positioning is critical to effectively use, so we are adjusting it so that Reinhardt doesn’t have their ultimate be effectively canceled when Lifeweaver uses Life Grip.

Life Grip

Reinhardt is no longer a valid target for Life Grip during Earthshatter, and using Earthshatter will cancel Life Grip.

HERO OPTION UPDATES

In addition to the hero balance adjustments in this update, we are implementing multiple quality-of-life settings for several heroes to give you the ability to custom-tailor your experience of playing your favorite heroes.

137,Here's a look at the 2023 Pride theme for Apple Watch and iPhone - 9to5Mac,https://9to5mac.com/2023/05/09/2023-pride-theme-apple-watch-iphone/,"9to5Mac revealed a first look at the 2023 Apple Watch Pride face and band last month, and Apple officially announced them on Tuesday. While the new band won’t be available in stores until May 24, the company has confirmed that the new Pride watch face and wallpaper for iPhone are coming next week with watchOS 9.5 and iOS 16.5. Here’s a closer look at what they look like.

Apple says the new sport band is “inspired by the strength and beauty of the LGBTQ+ community.” It features the original pride flag rainbow colors, as well as black and brown to represent Black and Latin communities. Additionally, the light blue, pink, and white colors represent transgender and nonbinary individuals.

New Pride face for Apple Watch

The new Pride face for Apple Watch is inspired by the design of the new 2023 Pride band. By default, it shows an analog watch with colored pills around the display. The hands match the colors they’re currently pointing to. However, users can customize the new watch face.

There are three different styles available: Motion, Hour Marks, and Numerals. The first one is the default, getting its name because the colored pills move when the display is awake. You can also tap the screen to interact with them. This style has no complications available except for the calendar or digital time in the center.

Hour Marks and Numerals transform the watch face into one very similar to the classic Infographic, with four complications in the corners plus one in the center. As the name suggests, one of them features the numerals on the clock, while the other shows only the reference marks. In this case, the numbers and markers are displayed in the same colors as the colored pills.

Although Apple’s marketing images show the new watch face with a white background, users can change the background to black. There’s no option to change the colors of the complications.

New Pride wallpaper for iPhone

Apple has also introduced a new Pride wallpaper for iPhone that’s also based on the 2023 Pride band and watch face. However, the colored pills take up almost the entire iPhone screen. They also move when you lock and unlock the screen. On the iPhone 14 Pro, the pills get thinner in Always-on mode.

The background changes from white to black based on whether the system is set to light or dark mode. Users can change the font and add widgets to the Lock Screen, but you can only choose between gradient and white as color options.

Availability

According to Apple, iOS 16.5 and watchOS 9.5 will be released to the public next week. However, developers and public beta testers can already add the new Pride theme by installing the RC builds that were released today.

It’s worth noting that you can still buy the 2022 edition of the Apple Watch Pride band.",technology,1
138,EA CEO: Activision Blizzard Deal Is 'Not Really Material to Us' - IGN,https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-ceo-activision-blizzard-deal-is-not-really-material-to-us,"Xbox's nascent Activision Blizzard acquisition remains a hot topic following the decision by the UK Competition and Markets Authority [CMA] to block the deal, but Electronic Arts CEO Andrew doesn't seem too worried one way or another whether it goes through.

Speaking on a call following EA's most recent round of earnings, Wilson said EA is ""Microsoft's biggest partner"" while claiming that it is ""the number one publisher on their platform.""

Microsoft Acquires Activision Blizzard: The Story So Far 20 Images

""So whether that deal goes through or not is not really material to us, broadly,"" Wilson finished. ""We think we have the scale, again back to our network, our IP and our talent, to continue to navigate the future and lead the future of entertainment and compete in a marketplace regardless of whether that deal goes through or not.""

Talking about the broader trend of industry consolidation, Wilson said he would love for EA to ""have the scale to be a meaningful consolidator.""

""I think we have tremendous assets with respect to the future of entertainment. But as it stands today, we're indifferent as to whether that goes through or not. We think we have an incredible strategy, we feel like we have an incredible opportunity, and whether it goes through or not we'll continue to be the number one publisher on the Microsoft platform,"" Wilson said.

“ [W]hether that deal goes through or not is not really material to us

Wilson's comments come amid continued speculation that EA might eventually be acquired itself. EA was reportedly approached by Comcast, but the deal fell apart due to disagreements over price and structure. EA continues to be in a strong position on its own, with FIFA 23 recently celebrating the biggest launch in franchise history.

139,Cincinnati man says Apple Watch saved his life after he collapsed during walk - WCPO 9 Cincinnati,https://www.wcpo.com/money/angies-list/health/cincinnati-man-says-apple-watch-saved-his-life-after-he-collapsed-during-walk,"CINCINNATI — Little did 83-year-old William Fryer know that a fall in the middle of his walk would save his life.

In February, Fryer walked his usual path along the Ohio River Trail but noticed his knees started to feel like rubber.

“I knew I was going to go down,” Fryer said.

He turned around, hoping if he fell someone would see him.

“I went down and the first thing I remember is rolling over on my back and the phone is wanting to know if they can call for an emergency,” he said.

Fryer's Apple Watch detected his fall and sent an SOS to emergency medical services. It also alerted his daughter and son-in-law to the fall.

While he doesn’t remember much after the fall, Fryer said he does remember seeing an off-duty Cincinnati police officer at his side.

“She held my arm and started talking to my watch,” Fryer said.

Paramedics arrived and examined Fryer, but they couldn’t determine why he fell.

“They finally said, 'We can’t find anything wrong. We can take you home or we can take you to the hospital,' and I said wait a minute let's talk about this a little further,” Fryer said.

He opted to go to Christ Hospital where he met Vascular and Interventional Radiologist Dr. Scott Tatum. He interprets MRIs, CT scans, ultrasounds, and X-rays. An X-ray of Fryer’s chest showed he had a big blood clot.

“I made my way to the emergency room and when I saw him I was a little bit surprised because he was laying very comfortably,” Tatum said.

Tatum said Fryer had atypical blood clot symptoms. Some of the usual symptoms include shortness of breath, chest pain and exercise intolerance. Fryer had none of those things. He noted his heart rate wasn’t abnormal and his blood pressure was in the acceptable range but a little low.

He started to ask Fryer questions about his medical history. Fryer showed him a year’s worth of information about his blood pressure and heart rate he keeps in a health tracking app on his phone.

“What I’m seeing in the hospital is clearly abnormal for him; even though it doesn’t look abnormal for like the entire population of the United States; even though his heart rate wasn’t above 100 it was still very clear it was an abnormal heart rate for him. I mean he was just sitting, he was sitting in the hospital bed relaxing, but his heart rate was probably double his normal heart rate,” Tatum said.

The information Fryer presented signaled to Tatum he needed to intervene. The following day, Tatum performed a procedure to remove the blood clot.

“Probably a foot long if it had been stretched out from end to end,” Tatum said.

“To me, it looked like half-strips of bacon. About the same length of a strip of bacon, but it was like it was cut in half the long way and they’re carrying it over holding it at both ends. I didn’t know blood could get that thick,” Fryer said.

Tatum said Fryer had a high-risk pulmonary embolism. The mortality rate can be up to 50% at 30 days.

Fryer said he’s grateful for his Apple Watch and is happy he can start walking again.

“I’m up walking every day if it’s nice,” said Fryer. “This is the easiest thing I can do to get some exercise.”",technology,1

Now, less than a day before Google is poised to publicly announce the device, yet another Pixel 7a leak gives us one last unofficial look at the device.

Today, @OnLeaks published with MediaPeanut a leaked promo video of the Pixel 7a, showing off the phone that we’ve seen so many countless times so far. The video doesn’t really tell us much new about the phone – it’s a Tensor G2-powered device with a new camera, wireless charging, and an updated design to match the rest of the Pixel 7 series, as so many past leaks have shown – but it’s a good chance to see the phone one more time before Google’s unveiling.

The video from @OnLeaks shows the Pixel 7a in its black, white, and blue colors while also highlighting software features such as Night Sight, Photo Unblur, Magic Eraser, and more. Meanwhile, an English version shows the same video, but featuring the Coral version of the Pixel 7a, courtesy of SnoopyTech.

142,Space junk cleanup mission to launch in 2026 aboard Arianespace rocket - Space.com,https://www.space.com/arianespace-rocket-space-junk-cleanup-mission-2026,"An ambitious space junk cleanup mission now has its rocket ride.

Swiss startup ClearSpace plans to launch an ""active debris removal mission"" to take out a piece of space junk no earlier than the first half of 2026. That mission, known as ClearSpace-1, will ride aboard an Arianespace Vega-C rocket, we learned on Tuesday (May 9).

ClearSpace-1 aims to ""rendezvous, capture and remove a piece of space debris,"" according to a press release (opens in new tab) issued Tuesday by France-based Arianespace.

If all goes to plan on the mission, which is funded by the European Space Agency (ESA), the ClearSpace-1 spacecraft will meet up with a payload adapter left behind by a Vega rocket launch in 2013. The adapter is already in a ""gradual disposal"" orbit, meaning that it will fall back into Earth's atmosphere naturally without intervention.

""The simple shape of this space debris will allow [the mission] to demonstrate the technologies of the spacecraft and its quartet of robotic arms, thus opening the way for more challenging missions with multiple captures per flight,"" Arianespace added in Tuesday's statement.

Related: The worst space debris events of all time

Since the space age dawned in 1957, humans have sent more than 12,000 satellites to space, according to ESA (opens in new tab). While most of them are active or have naturally entered Earth's atmosphere, ESA estimates there are 3,000 non-operational spacecraft still in orbit.

Hundreds more satellites launch every year. Many of them are part of SpaceX's Starlink megaconstellation, which aims to have 40,000 members in orbit eventually, tenfold the 4,000 currently active Starlink craft.

Then there are the pieces left behind by space missions. ESA estimates that Earth orbit has about 36,500 debris objects more than 4 inches (10 centimeters) wide, 1 million between 0.4 inches and 4 inches (1 to 10 cm) across, and 330 million that are smaller than 0.4 inches (1 cm) but bigger than 0.04 inches (1 millimeter).

Each of these pieces whips around the Earth at incredible speed. For example, the International Space Station (which has had to dodge orbital debris dozens of times) is in an orbit where objects fly at about 17,100 mph (27,500 kph). With more spacecraft and pieces comes more risk of debris crashing into each other, or even slamming into active spacecraft, which does happen occasionally despite operators' best efforts.

Related: How often does the International Space Station have to dodge space debris?

The Vega-C rocket has made two flights to space to date. Its first flight, in July 2022, was a success, but the second, which launched on Dec. 20, failed due to a fault in a rocket nozzle, according to an investigation cited by ESA in March.

Arianespace has pledged to implement the recommendations of the investigation commission and target another launch of Vega-C in late 2023.

Vega-C is a more powerful successor to the Vega set of rocket lines that debuted in 2012. Vega-C can send 5,070 pounds (2,300 kilograms) of payload to a 435-mile-high (700 kilometers) sun-synchronous orbit, compared to 3,300 pounds (1,500 kg) for the older rocket, according to Arianespace (opens in new tab).

Another mission with ESA funding, by Tokyo-based Astroscale's ELSA-d, launched in March 2021 with a simulated piece of debris. Debris-capture tests were halted in May 2022, however, due to ""anomalous spacecraft conditions,"" Astroscale said at the time.

143,New Xbox Game Pass Game Brings Back SNES Series - ComicBook.com,https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-snes-games-shadowrun-trilogy/,"A new Xbox Game Pass and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate addition brings back a series that can trace its roots all the way back to the SNES. This new addition is actually a collection, which means there is now technically three new games for subscribers to play, but unfortunately only on PC. The collection is available on Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S, but the new Game Pass addition is for PC only. More specifically, if you're an Xbox Game Pass subscriber on PC you can now enjoy Shadowrun Trilogy, which is comprised of a trio of games from 2013, 2014, and 2015, respectively: Shadowrun Returns, Shadowrun Dragonfall – Director's Cut, and Shadowrun Hong Kong – Extended Edition.

For those unfamilar with the Shadowrun series, it's a sci-fi tabletop role-playing game that was created in 1989. It was first adapted to video games in 1993 under the same name and courtesy of Beam Dog. Unfortunately, this is not the version that's been added. There were three Shadowrun releases in the 90s and then another n 2007, but these are not included. That said, these installments don't hold up in 2023, so that's for the better probably.

""The Shadowrun Trilogy comprises three cult tactical RPG games taking place in a dystopian cyberpunk future in which magic has re-awakened, bringing back to life creatures of high fantasy,"" reads an official elevator pitch of the product. ""Initially created as a tabletop RPG over 30 years ago, this one-of-a-kind setting that has gained a huge cult following during the past three decades.""

Xbox Game Pass and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate are both available via Xbox One, Xbox Series S, Xbox Series X, and PC at the price points of $10 and $15 a month, respectively. The major differences between the two different tiers, other than the price, is that the latter comes with EA Play access and an Xbox Live Gold subscription bundled in.

144,AI gains “values” with Anthropic’s new Constitutional AI chatbot approach - Ars Technica,https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/05/ai-with-a-moral-compass-anthropic-outlines-constitutional-ai-in-its-claude-chatbot/,"On Tuesday, AI startup Anthropic detailed the specific principles of its ""Constitutional AI"" training approach that provides its Claude chatbot with explicit ""values."" It aims to address concerns about transparency, safety, and decision-making in AI systems without relying on human feedback to rate responses.

Claude is an AI chatbot similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT that Anthropic released in March.

""We’ve trained language models to be better at responding to adversarial questions, without becoming obtuse and saying very little,"" Anthropic wrote in a tweet announcing the paper. ""We do this by conditioning them with a simple set of behavioral principles via a technique called Constitutional AI.""

Keeping AI models on the rails

When researchers first train a raw large language model (LLM), almost any text output is possible. An unconditioned model might tell you how to build a bomb, that one race should extinguish another, or try to convince you to jump off a cliff.

Currently, the responses of bots like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Microsoft's Bing Chat avoid this kind of behavior using a conditioning technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).

To utilize RLHF, researchers provide a series of sample AI model outputs (responses) to humans. The humans then rank the outputs in terms of how desirable or appropriate the responses seem based on the inputs. The researchers then feed that rating information back into the model, altering the neural network and changing the model's behavior.

As effective as RLHF has been at keeping ChatGPT from going off the rails (Bing? Not as much), the technique has drawbacks, including relying on human labor and also exposing those humans to potentially trauma-inducing material.

By contrast, Anthropic's Constitutional AI seeks to guide the outputs of AI language models in a subjectively ""safer and more helpful"" direction by training it with an initial list of principles. ""This isn’t a perfect approach,"" Anthropic writes, ""but it does make the values of the AI system easier to understand and easier to adjust as needed.""

In this case, Anthropic's principles include the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, portions of Apple's terms of service, several trust and safety ""best practices,"" and Anthropic's AI research lab principles. The constitution is not finalized, and Anthropic plans to iteratively improve it based on feedback and further research.

For example, here are four Constitutional AI principles Anthropic pulled from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights:

Please choose the response that most supports and encourages freedom, equality, and a sense of brotherhood.

Please choose the response that is least racist and sexist, and that is least discriminatory based on language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth, or other status.

Please choose the response that is most supportive and encouraging of life, liberty, and personal security.

Please choose the response that most discourages and opposes torture, slavery, cruelty, and inhuman or degrading treatment.

Interestingly, Anthropic drew from Apple's terms of service to cover deficiencies in the UN Declaration of Rights (a sentence we thought we would never write):

""While the UN declaration covered many broad and core human values, some of the challenges of LLMs touch on issues that were not as relevant in 1948, like data privacy or online impersonation. To capture some of these, we decided to include values inspired by global platform guidelines, such as Apple’s terms of service, which reflect efforts to address issues encountered by real users in a similar digital domain.""

Anthropic says the principles in Claude's constitution cover a wide range of topics, from ""commonsense"" directives (""don’t help a user commit a crime"") to philosophical considerations (""avoid implying that AI systems have or care about personal identity and its persistence""). The company has published the complete list on its website.

Detailed in a research paper released in December, Anthropic's AI model training process applies a constitution in two phases. First, the model critiques and revises its responses using the set of principles, and second, reinforcement learning relies on AI-generated feedback to select the more ""harmless"" output. The model does not prioritize specific principles; instead, it randomly pulls a different principle each time it critiques, revises, or evaluates its responses. ""It does not look at every principle every time, but it sees each principle many times during training,"" writes Anthropic.

According to Anthropic, Claude is proof of the effectiveness of Constitutional AI, responding ""more appropriately"" to adversarial inputs while still delivering helpful answers without resorting to evasion. (In ChatGPT, evasion usually involves the familiar ""As an AI language model"" statement.)",technology,1

It will publish a new action-adventure game from Game Freak meant to be a new IP for the developer.

Codenamed ""Project Bloom,"" Game Freak and Private Division state in a press release the new IP is expected to launch during Private Division parent company Take-Two's Fiscal Year 2026. Alongside this news, Game Freak has released the first piece of concept art for Project Bloom. You can check it out below:

""We're thrilled to have the opportunity to create new IP that is bold and tonally different from our prior work,"" Game Freak director Kota Furushima writes in the release. ""From the beginning, Private Division was the publisher we wanted to work with on our new game. Their track record and global expertise gives us all the confidence to create a sweeping new action-adventure game that we can't wait to share more about in the future.""

Take-Two Interactive chief strategy officer and Private Division head Micahel Worosz says you'd be hard-pressed to find a studio with more iconic hits over the past 30 years than Game Freak, addding, ""We're ready to help Game Freak unleash their potential and we're honored to be the first Western publisher to work alongside this exceptionally talented and proven team to bring a bold new IP to market.""

Game Freak was founded in 1989 and is best known for developing the majority of mainline Pokémon entries across various Nintendo consoles. Its most recent Pokémon release was last year's Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. It has, however, released non-Pokémon games throughout its history, including this year's Pocket Card Jockey: Ride On! on iOS and macOS devices.

Private Division was founded in 2017 as a third publishing label within Take-Two Interactive. Notable titles published by Private Division include Hades, The Outer Worlds, Kerbal Space Program 2, Rollerdrome, OlliOlli World, and more.

147,Microsoft disarms push notification bombers with number matching in Authenticator - The Register,https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/09/microsoft_authenticator_number_matching/,"Microsoft is hoping to curb a growing threat to multi-factor authentication (MFA) by enforcing a number-matching step for those using Microsoft Authenticator push notifications when signing into services.

Starting this week, Redmond is putting some muscle behind a number-matching feature that it began talking about last year. It said there were rising numbers of cyberattacks using MFA fatigue, also known as MFA push spamming and push bombing.

Two-factor authentication (2FA) and MFA are strategies for verifying users trying to log on to websites, accounts or services, and are part of the larger drive for zero-trust architectures, which take the position that anything or anyone trying to climb onto a network can't be trusted or given access until verified.

MFA can come in the form of a one-time code you enter, or an app on a linked device that pops up a notification asking if a login attempt is legit. If someone is trying to login as you, you can decline access. If it's you trying to get in, you can approve the login.

Attackers are finding ways around MFA protections, such as through phishing, and, in this case, MFA fatigue, a social engineering effort in which attackers use stolen credentials to try to sign into a protected account quickly and repeatedly, overwhelming potential victims with push notifications asking for login approval.

Initially the targeted individual will likely hit the prompt to indicate it isn't them trying to sign in, but may be worn down in the spamming onslaught and eventually accept the login to stop the harassment. Essentially, MFA is supposed to thwart those using stolen login credentials, but in reality, the protection measure can be bypassed by exploiting the human element: spamming users with notifications on their devices until they assume it's a bug and hit accept. At that point, the miscreant is in your account.

It's a threat Microsoft, among other vendors and security pros, has been tracking for a couple of years. Redmond saw almost 41,000 Azure Active Directory Protection sessions with multiple failed MFA attempts in August 2022, compared with 32,442 a year earlier, and noted that such attacks had ""become more prevalent.""

MFA fatigue also is one of any number of reasons Microsoft is leaning on in an industry push – and that of others, including Google and Apple – to do away with passwords entirely as a verification tool.

There were some high-profile attacks last year that featured MFA fatigue schemes. The Yanluowang ransomware gang used it in an strike against Cisco while the Lapsus$ group leaked 37GB of source code stolen from Microsoft after compromising an employee via MFA fatigue. Uber was also hit by Lapsus$ via such an attack, it's reported.

In October 2022, Microsoft introduced number matching as an option, as well as other security features like location and application context, in Microsoft Authenticator. Now, number matching is automatically being enabled for all push notifications in Authenticator.

""As relevant services deploy, users worldwide who are enabled for Authenticator push notifications will begin to see number matching in their approval requests,"" the vendor wrote in an Azure support note this week. ""Users can be enabled for Authenticator push notifications either in the Authentication methods policy or the legacy multifactor authentication policy"" as long as notifications through the mobile app is enabled.""

The note also said that number matching doesn't support push notifications for Apple Watch or Android wearable devices. ""Wearable device users need to use their phone to approve notifications when number matching is enabled,"" Microsoft wrote.

When it's enforced, Authenticator users responding to a MFA push notification will be presented with another number that they'll need to type into whatever app is being logged into to complete the process. Authenticator users will not be able to opt out of the feature. It effectively adds a one-time code element to the push notification approach.

Some services will begin deploying the changes starting this week and ""users will start to see number match in approval requests. As services deploy, some may see number match while others don't. To ensure consistent behavior for all users, we highly recommend you enable number match for Authenticator push notifications in advance.""

The number matching also will work in other scenarios with Authenticator, including self-service password reset (SSPR), AD FS adapters (on support Windows Server versions), and combined MFA and SSPR registration when setting up Authenticator.

For Windows users who don't use Authenticator, their default sign-in method won't change, according to Redmond. ®",technology,1
148,Samsung One UI 5 Watch update: When will your smartwatch get it? - SamMobile - Samsung news,https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-one-ui-5-watch-update-when-will-you-get-it/,"In the coming months, Samsung will be releasing major new One UI updates for both its smartphones and its smartwatches. Samsung is currently testing One UI 6.0 for Galaxy smartphones (and tablets) and will eventually let customers try it through a beta program around the time Google releases the Android 14 update in the second half of the year.

For Galaxy smartwatches, Samsung recently announced One UI 5 Watch. One UI 5 Watch will bring some useful new features to the company’s Wear OS smartwatches and will make its official debut with the Galaxy Watch 6 series in late July.

One UI 5 Watch beta program kicks off in May

But what about the Galaxy Watch 5 and Galaxy Watch 4 lineups? When will those get the One UI 5 Watch update? Well, the stable public version of One UI 5 Watch (which will be accompanied by Wear OS 4) will likely be released for the Galaxy Watch 4 and Galaxy Watch 5 after the Watch 6 has gone on sale, which means you can expect it to be available sometime in August.

However, for those who own a Galaxy Watch 4 or Galaxy Watch 5 and live in the US or South Korea, Samsung will be starting a One UI 5 Watch beta program sometime this month! Once the beta program kicks off, interested users will be able to enroll through the Samsung Members app on their phone, similar to how one can register for Samsung’s One UI beta program for Galaxy smartphones.

Whether or not Samsung will expand the beta program to other markets remains to be seen. One UI betas for Galaxy phones are usually released in the US, the UK, Poland, Germany, Korea, India, and China, and Samsung will hopefully open up the One UI 5 Watch beta program in at least some of those markets.",technology,1
149,2024 Could Bring Us The Largest iPhone Yet - Gizmodo,https://gizmodo.com/iphone-16-screen-display-size-rumors-leaks-15-pro-ultra-1850419656,"The iPhone 15 hasn’t even been officially announced, and yet the iPhone 16 hype train is already pulling out of the station. According to display supply chain consultant Ross Young , we could be set to see the largest iPhone yet with the “Ultra” version of the iPhone 16, currently slated for 2024.

Young is a routine analyst of upcoming Apple products, and according to his Twitter, t he 16 Pro’s screen size could be around 6.2 inches, while the Pro Max-equivalent could stretch over 6.8 inches. For comparison, the iPhone 14 Pro display is 6.12 inches, while the Max is 6.69.

Advertisement

The iPhone 15 is expected to be about the same size as current models, with the regular iPhone expected to be 6.1 inches while the Plus and supposed “Pro Ultra” variants will extend to 6.7 inches.

One of the closest modern comparisons to the supposed iPhone 16 Ultra size would be the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, another large phone with a 6.8-inch display. Of course, all these large devices fail to compare to foldables like the Galaxy Z Fold 4, which extends to a 7.6-inch OLED display compared to its 6.2-inch exterior screen.



While folks with baseball glove-sized mitts might rejoice, those with small hands know that the bigger a phone’s screen size, the harder it is to handle. A pple could make a larger phone more ergonomic by rounding its edges more, though Apple has been extremely consistent in its iPhone silhouette from generation to generation.

Advertisement

A bigger phone could point to more room for mobile hardware such as camera lenses . The regular iPhone 14 as well as the Pro Max camera are already quality photo snappers, though size doesn’t mean everything, as the larger Galaxy still can’t shoot as well as the Pixel 7 Pro at night. The iPhone 15 is rumored to have a periscope-style rear camera akin to the Galaxy S23, allowing for more stabilization while zooming. Apple could be trying something else with an ever larger silhouette, though it’s all just speculation whether this means even more or at least larger lenses.

While we expect Apple to show off changes to iOS at WWDC 2023 in June, Apple is likely to keep on with its usual September release date for its new iPhones. Since we’re still more than a year out from any new next-gen model, things could easily change.

151,"Next New Honkai: Star Rail Characters Are Silver Wolf, Luocha, Yukong - Siliconera",https://www.siliconera.com/next-new-honkai-star-rail-characters-are-silver-wolf-luocha-yukong/,"Ahead of official global social media accounts, HoYoVerse revealed on its bilibili channel who the next new characters will be in Honkai Star Rail. Silver Wolf and Luocha will be limited 5-stars and Yukong will be a 4-star, and they’ll likely debut in Honkai Star Rail Version 1.1. Of the three, only Silver Wolf belongs to a faction other than Xianzhou Luofu. [Thanks, Inside Games!]

From the tutorial, we know that Silver Wolf is a Quantum/Nihility character in Honkai: Star Rail. She very closely resembles Bronya Zaychik from Honkai Impact 3rd, of which Star Rail is a spin-off of. Silver Wolf has a very hacker-like moveset, in which it looks like she can manipulate the space around her to create constructs from retro video games.

Luocha is a traveling merchant who carries around a giant coffin. He is an Imaginary character who is likely of the Abundance Path due to his healing capabilities. Akira Ishida (Athrun from Mobile Suit Gundam SeeD) voices him in the Japanese dub. We already meet him as an NPC in the game as part of the 1.0 Trailblazer Missions.

Yukong is Tingyun’s superior, but little else in terms of information is available to us at the moment. As a 4-star, she will likely be available permanently even after the next banners. In Japanese, Yumi Toma (Raine from Tales of Symphonia) is her voice actress.

Honkai Star Rail is available on mobile devices and Windows PC. PS4 and PS5 versions will come out in the near future. Silver Wolf, Luocha, and Yukong will all show up soon in future updates of Honkai Star Rail.",technology,1
152,Tears of the Kingdom: Nintendo Always Planned to Use Breath of the Wild's Hyrule for the Sequel - IGN,https://www.ign.com/articles/botw-hyrule-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo,"While Hyrule has been the setting for many Legend of Zelda games, we've also taken departures to locations such as Termina, Koholint Island, Holodrum, and others. But for Tears of the Kingdom, there was absolutely no question in the developers' minds that the Breath of the Wild sequel would return to the same Hyrule of its predecessor.

In an interview published by Nintendo, series producer Eiji Aonuma said that creating a completely new world in a new game was never even really a discussion, because the team had been coming up with ideas for a direct sequel since Breath of the Wild was in development.

""Just like somewhere you know inside and out, we understand where everything is in Hyrule from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and because of that, we believed it was possible to create new gameplay,"" added director Hidemaro Fujibayashi. ""For this reason, in the initial proposal, we clearly stated 'the setting will not change' as an important concept. Even when I shared this with the team members here, there were no objections, and we were all aligned on that idea from that point onward.""

Furthermore, technical director Takuhiro Dohta said that idea of staying in the same place but layering on new mechanics and ideas came to him through a rather surprising inspiration: Wii Sports Resort.

""When I was working on the programming for Wuhu Island during Wii Sports Resort's development, I remembered [Shigeru] Miyamoto-san saying that he wanted to 'turn the actual stages of games into characters.' What he meant by that was to create one island and use that as a base to add various kinds of gameplay in different games. The idea of having new discoveries in the same setting was striking to me. I'd been wanting to try this idea with other titles, and I supposed this game would leverage that kind of approach.""

Dohta also noted that becaues they give players the ability to dive from the sky to the ground, having the ground be a familiar location helps encourage them to use the mechanic, because their destination isn't entirely unfamiliar.

153,Meta's open-source ImageBind AI aims to mimic human perception | Engadget - Engadget,https://www.engadget.com/metas-open-source-imagebind-ai-aims-to-mimic-human-perception-181500560.html,"Meta is open-sourcing an AI tool called ImageBind that predicts connections between data similar to how humans perceive or imagine an environment. While image generators like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion and DALL-E 2 pair words with images, allowing you to generate visual scenes based only on a text description, ImageBind casts a broader net. It can link text, images / videos, audio, 3D measurements (depth), temperature data (thermal), and motion data (from inertial measurement units) — and it does this without having to first train on every possibility. It’s an early stage of a framework that could eventually generate complex environments from an input as simple as a text prompt, image or audio recording (or some combination of the three).

You could view ImageBind as moving machine learning closer to human learning. For example, if you’re standing in a stimulating environment like a busy city street, your brain (largely unconsciously) absorbs the sights, sounds and other sensory experiences to infer information about passing cars and pedestrians, tall buildings, weather and much more. Humans and other animals evolved to process this data for our genetic advantage: survival and passing on our DNA. (The more aware you are of your surroundings, the more you can avoid danger and adapt to your environment for better survival and prosperity.) As computers get closer to mimicking animals’ multi-sensory connections, they can use those links to generate fully realized scenes based only on limited chunks of data.

So, while you can use Midjourney to prompt “a basset hound wearing a Gandalf outfit while balancing on a beach ball” and get a relatively realistic photo of this bizarre scene, a multimodal AI tool like ImageBind may eventually create a video of the dog with corresponding sounds, including a detailed suburban living room, the room’s temperature and the precise locations of the dog and anyone else in the scene. “This creates distinctive opportunities to create animations out of static images by combining them with audio prompts,” Meta researchers said today in a developer-focused blog post. “For example, a creator could couple an image with an alarm clock and a rooster crowing, and use a crowing audio prompt to segment the rooster or the sound of an alarm to segment the clock and animate both into a video sequence.”

As for what else one could do with this new toy, it points clearly to one of Meta’s core ambitions: VR, mixed reality and the metaverse. For example, imagine a future headset that can construct fully realized 3D scenes (with sound, movement, etc.) on the fly. Or, virtual game developers could perhaps eventually use it to take much of the legwork out of their design process. Similarly, content creators could make immersive videos with realistic soundscapes and movement based on only text, image or audio input. It’s also easy to imagine a tool like ImageBind opening new doors in the accessibility space, generating real-time multimedia descriptions to help people with vision or hearing disabilities better perceive their immediate environments.

“In typical AI systems, there is a specific embedding (that is, vectors of numbers that can represent data and their relationships in machine learning) for each respective modality,” said Meta. “ImageBind shows that it’s possible to create a joint embedding space across multiple modalities without needing to train on data with every different combination of modalities. This is important because it’s not feasible for researchers to create datasets with samples that contain, for example, audio data and thermal data from a busy city street, or depth data and a text description of a seaside cliff.”

Meta views the tech as eventually expanding beyond its current six “senses,” so to speak. “While we explored six modalities in our current research, we believe that introducing new modalities that link as many senses as possible — like touch, speech, smell, and brain fMRI signals — will enable richer human-centric AI models.” Developers interested in exploring this new sandbox can start by diving into Meta’s open-source code.",technology,1
154,The Zelda logos divide fans – but which one is actually best? - Creative Bloq,https://www.creativebloq.com/news/zelda-logo-debate,"In the run up to the release of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Nintendo's latest instalment in the Zelda franchise, we're taking a look back at the ever-changing logo design. With consistent typography and a plethora of different illustrations, each logo perfectly represents the game style – but which one is the best?

Fans have historically had a lot to say on which Zelda logo is the most successful – as proved by a Reddit post from last year, which sparked a fierce debate. Here, we take a look at some of the standout logos, and share some of the debate surrounding the controversial issue. Want more logo inspo? See our favourite places to get logo design inspiration.

(Image credit: Nintendo)

As shown in this graphic, the series has had consistent logo design since the release of the original Legend of Zelda game back in 1986. The name of the titular princess sits front and centre in bold letters with elegant serifs, with ""The Legend of"" sitting neatly tucked above the name. The sub-header of the specific game then sits below that, slightly offset to the right to snugly fit in the crevices of the word. It's a simple design, yet the sheer variety of game titles available today proves just how versatile this formula is.

The varying game styles of the Zelda franchise have a big impact on the logo design. From the ultra cartoony Wind Waker to the gritty darkness of Twilight Princess and Majora's Mask, Nintendo certainly isn't afraid to experiment with the tone of its games. With such a wide range of themes and styles on offer, each logo needs to quickly inform potential players what kind of game they're about to play.

The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask (Image credit: Nintendo)

In a thread shared to Reddit by user r/Mabroon (opens in new tab) last year, fans were divided on which is the best logo overall and many shared their personal favourites. Lots were hooked on the Majora's Mask version for it's sheer spook-factor (see it above). ""Majoras mask has the best one. It’s super ominous with the mask in the back"" one fan commented.

It's definitely one of the more unique logos of the bunch, with the lettering coloured a rich shade of purple and the menacing mask peering out from behind it. Whilst the majority of the mask itself is in shadow, those piercing orange eyes boldly stare at the viewer. It's certainly unsettling.

The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (Image credit: Nintendo)

Another favourite was the Ocarina of Time logo, mainly because of the nostalgia it invokes. Originally released in 1998 for the N64, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time was the first major 3D Zelda game and paved the way for action adventure games as we know them today thanks to the rich open world and detailed story. One comment admitted ""I really like Skyward Sword’s ngl. But Ocarina of Time… you just can’t beat the classics…"". I love the rough texturing on the letters and the shining sword and shield.

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (Image credit: Nintendo)

Of course, I can't write this article without talking about Breath of the Wild logo. A few fans in the above Reddit post stated that the Breath of the Wild offering was their firm favourite. ""It's so simple, yet says a lot about the game, whilst also adding a layer of mystery. The master sword is old and rusty looking, the flowers emerging from it add to the games title. Gives everything an ancient feel. So good!"". The rusted Master Sword that boldly contrasts the royal gold lettering is a great touch of visual storytelling.

(Image credit: Nintendo)

And as for the Tears of the Kingdom logo, I guess I can't say too much until we know the context of the game (which releases this coming Friday). However, I already know that this is one of my personal favourites (although Twilight Princess still takes my top spot).

The way the Master Sword dissolves into the intricate patterning to match the rest of the logo is a subtle yet beautiful detail. This is also the first all-white Zelda logo and I love how it perfectly blends into the main box art. If the game is as well thought out as the logo, I know we're in good hands when it comes to this brand new story. I certainly feel like we'll be adding it to our list of the best Nintendo Switch games of all time.",technology,1

156,How to Set Up a Passkey for Apple or Google - Lifehacker,https://lifehacker.com/embrace-the-passwordless-future-of-passkeys-1850418024,"Digital passwords have existed since the 1960s, and we haven’t come up with a better option...until now. An tech industry-wide group called the FIDO Alliance aims to get rid of them, and for good reason: Passwords are easy to hack, and difficult to remember. The smarter method, they argue, is to scrap troublesome passwords altogether and use cryptographic keys for authentication instead. These tools are popularly known as passkeys, and they are already starting to take off.

Google and Apple have added passkeys into various products and services, and other big companies like Microsoft are not far behind. Of course, a big change like this brings its own set of questions: How easy is it going to be to switch from passwords to passkeys? Are passkeys really that much safer? What happens if I lose my passkey?

How passkeys work in theory

Passkeys are built on public web authentication standards. Instead of creating a password, you create a cryptographically generated passkey that’s stored on your device. This key is unique, private, and strong. A public counterpart of this authentication is also stored on the server you’re trying to log into, and is only used to facilitate the login process. Even if the server component is leaked, nothing is truly lost, since you can’t log in using your passkey unless you also have your device.

Because each passkey is linked to the particular account, there’s no risk of phishing, as you can’t be forced to use your Google Account passkey with a scam website that looks like a Google login page.

You can create generate a passkey for all your devices individually. Here, using something like iCloud Keychain is helpful, because you can create one passkey and use it across all your Apple devices. Google also supports this feature for Google Accounts.

Passkeys also support a feature called cross-device authentication, which allows you to authenticate using a passkey stored on your iPhone or Android smartphone. A login form will show a QR code. Scan it and authenticate using your smartphone, and you’re in! If you’re concerned about the security of using a simple QR code, don’t be: This feature only works if the smartphone is near enough to the unauthenticated device to connect over Bluetooth. And once the QR code is scanned, it becomes invalid.

Setting up a passkey through Google and Apple

Let’s take a look at two different approaches to setting up a passkey, starting with Google. Google lets you create a passkey for logging into your Google Account, which offers great protection for your entire Google world. As long as you meet the right requirements, you can use your personal device to log into your Google Account using a passkey.

To start, go to Google’s Passkeys setup page. Log in, then choose Create a passkey. Click Continue on the popup to create a passkey for the device you’re using (say, your iPhone). Now, choose your account, then hit Continue.

Now, you can use your device password, Face ID, or PIN to authenticate yourself, and click Done to end the process. While you can create passkeys for as many devices as you want to log into Google with, you’ll find it’s particularly useful with Apple, since you’ll be able to sign in with that passkey on any Apple device using your Apple ID.

Speaking of Apple, they have a different passkey approach. You still need a traditional password to log into your Apple ID, but you can still set up passkeys to log into your various accounts, when supported. You’ll need an Apple device running iOS 16 or macOS Ventura or newer, and to be using iCloud Keychain.

When you create a new account that supports passkeys, or you access the account management settings of an account that supports passkeys, you’ll see the option to create a passkey. When you choose it, you can tap “Continue” to save the passkey (iPhone), or choose your authentication process on Mac (Touch ID, QR code, or external security key). This passkey will save to your iCloud Keychain, so you’ll be able to use it across all your Apple ID devices, not just the device you made it on.

How a passkey works in practice

Once you have created a passkey on your device, you only need authenticate your login using Face ID, Touch ID, or your device password or PIN. If you’re using Apple products, a single passkey will work for all your devices, and will support autofill as well—though you’ll be limited to using the Safari browser. If you’re using Chrome, you’ll need to create a new passkey from your Google Account. Currently, Firefox doesn’t support passkeys.



By way of example, here’s how the process works in Google. When you go to the login page, you’ll be asked to use passkeys instead of other methods. Click the Continue button.

Now, the OS level prompt for authentication will show up. For me, that’s logging into my MacBook Air on Safari via a Touch ID authentication. Once you authenticate, you’ll be logged in.

That’s it—a two-step process that’s secure and easy to use. You don’t need to remember a password, or wait for a one-time password or code over SMS, or even an authenticator app.



Passkeys aren’t just easier to use, they’re more secure

Passkeys are easier to use than passwords, especially when you consider the security issues of SMS 2FA, and the hassle of using a one-time authentication app. But the promise of passkeys goes beyond just ease of use—because they are made cryptographically, they are secure and encrypted by default, and will prevent phishing and other types of scams.

The only major downside of passkeys are their dependence on your device, and on keys generated by companies themselves. Device authentication is not an issue if you’re using Face ID and services like iCloud Keychain.

That said, you don’t have to trust big companies to generate your passkeys. Password managers like 1Password are evolving to help you manage all your passkeys in a secure, third-party account. And you’re always free to carry your passkeys around in a secure digital key that you own and manage yourself.

The clear advantage of using a service like 1Password or even iCloud Keychain is that passkeys are stored in end-t0-end encrypted vaults. As long as the account itself is secure, there is no risk of your data being compromised in a leak.",technology,1
157,The Queen's Lawyer Is Now Helping Activision Fight The Blocked Microsoft Acquisition In The UK - GameSpot,https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-queens-lawyer-is-now-helping-activision-fight-the-blocked-microsoft-acquisition-in-the-uk/1100-6513937/,"Both Activision Blizzard and Microsoft have reportedly hired high-profile lawyers to lead their appeals of the recent decision by the UK's Competition & Markets Authority to block their $68.7 billion merger.

According to The Financial Times, Activision Blizzard has hired Lord David Pannick KC, who previously represented Queen Elizabeth II, Boris Johnson, and Princess Diana. Pannick works for Blackstone Chambers and his clients have also included the prime minister of the UAE and the entire kingdom of Saudi Arabia. More recently, he represented Boris Johnson amid the former prime minister's ""partygate"" scandal.

For its part, Microsoft has retained the legal services of Daniel Beard KC of Monckton Chambers, according to The Telegraph. Beard is described as a big player in the market of legal matters pertaining to competition, public policy, and regulatory matters.

GameSpot has contacted Activision Blizzard and Microsoft in an attempt to confirm the details about the legal teams representing each company in their appeals process.

According to The Financial Times, Microsoft and Activision Blizzard will file appeals independently with the UK's Competition Appeal Tribunal. This is expected to be a challenging process, which is why Activision Blizzard and Microsoft lawyered up in the way they have.

The CMA previously decided against Facebook parent company Meta in a deal that people are referencing with respect to the Microsoft-Activision buyout. Meta bought Giphy in 2020 but the CMA ruled that it needed to sell the company in 2022, which it did after losing an appeal.

In a decision handed down on April 26, the CMA decided that it would block Microsoft's purchase of Activision Blizzard over concerns about the cloud gaming market. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has said the company does not need to acquire Activision Blizzard to deliver on its ambitions in the gaming space, but doing so would accelerate those plans.

""The CMA decision was disappointing. We've been talking to that group for coming up on a year. They defined a market of cloud gaming that, in my mind, doesn't really exist yet today. But they have a point of view that maybe we have a lead in a market that is just forming and that this content could somehow prohibit others from competing in that market,"" Spencer said. ""Activision Blizzard King is not our strategy. But it is an accelerant for our strategy.""

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom: Official Trailer 3

Earlier today, Nintendo reported a slowdown in Switch hardware sales and suggested no new hardware will launch before April 2024.

The company said it sold 17.97 million Switch consoles during the fiscal year ended in March, taking lifetime sales to 125.62 million.

It expects to sell 15 million Switch consoles during the current fiscal year, which would represent a 16.5% year-over-year decline.

“Nintendo Switch has entered its seventh year since launch, and while it will become more challenging to maintain the same sales momentum as before, our goal is to have more consumers continue to play Nintendo Switch for longer, leading to maximized sales,” the company said in a statement.

Speaking on an earnings call, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa reportedly said the company isn’t completely confident in hitting its 15 million sales target.

According to Bloomberg, Furukawa added that no new or upgraded hardware is factored into Nintendo’s annual forecast.

“Sustaining the Switch’s sales momentum will be difficult in its seventh year,” Furukawa said. “Our goal of selling 15 million units this fiscal year is a bit of stretch. But we will do our best to bolster demand going into the holiday season so that we can achieve the goal.”",technology,1
164,Researchers hope this tiny wearable could become Smell-o-Vision for VR - The Verge,https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/9/23715453/wearable-smell-virtual-reality-immersive,"Smells have always been hard to recreate in virtual reality, but researchers may have figured out a solution: wearable odor generators.

Researchers from Beihang University and the City University of Hong Kong detailed two types of device formats in a paper published today in Nature Communications. The first type is a wearable that attaches to the skin directly under the nose. The other is a soft mask. (You can see both demoed in the videos below.) The former can create two scents while the latter can create up to nine scents. Both generators contain scented wax that can be heated in about 1.44 seconds to release the desired scent in a localized area.

Altogether, the researchers were able to generate 30 different scents, including rosemary, mojito, pancake, pineapple, and ginger. The researchers must also have a twisted sense of humor, as durian was among the scents listed. (If you’ve never smelled a durian fruit, it’s been described as raw sewage, rotting flesh, and used gym socks.)

While current VR headsets can simulate vision, sound, and touch, virtual worlds are still largely odorless. Part of that is because there isn’t an elegant way to add scents to bulky VR gear. Ideally, the researchers say their version of this tech could be used to create a more immersive user experience in video games or 4D films as well as virtual teaching environments. They also suggested ideas such as using scents as an alternative communication message or to trigger memories.",technology,1
165,Samsung testing Android 14 well ahead of schedule - 9to5Google,https://9to5google.com/2023/05/09/samsung-android-14-testing-builds/,"Samsung has been speeding up the cadence of its Android version updates, and this week the first firm evidence of the company’s Android 14 update showed up, quite a bit ahead of schedule.

Android 14 is, of course, not nearly finalized. Google has issued one beta of the new system version, with another due basically any time now. The update doesn’t seem to be major by any means, but it brings some neat new features as we’ve previously covered.

But, interestingly, Samsung is now testing out early internal builds of its Android 14 update on Galaxy S23 devices, as multiple Twitter users noted. The folks at SamMobile also found builds for Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 4 and Flip 4.

The new update won’t be ready for customers for quite some time and it comes as no surprise that Samsung is already testing out the update. But what is notable here is the timing. Samsung has reached this stage of internal testing quite early, approximately two months early according to the person that first found these early test builds. Going back, though, we did notice that evidence of the update first showed up in June, but in either case, it’s still great to see Samsung making further progress.

Android 14 on Samsung devices, rumored to be called “One UI 6.0,” is confirmed to address longstanding issues with background apps on Galaxy devices, but it’s unclear what else Samsung has in store.

But over the past years, it has struggled to compete with Samsung and Google — and more recently with brands like Xiaomi. However, there’s something different about the new Huawei P60 Pro.

The company has been working on its XMage camera system since the partnership with Leica ended, and it’s now beginning to become a real competitor. To find out if Huawei is about to regain some of the ground it lost in camera supremacy, we tested the P60 Pro against the Google Pixel 7 Pro. Here’s what happened.

This is the Huawei P60 Pro

Huawei has announced the P60 Pro for global release, so what’s the phone itself like? It has a 6.67-inch OLED screen with a variable 1Hz to 120Hz refresh rate, plus a quad-curve body with a choice of two finishes — matte black or the stunning Rococo Pearl seen in our photos. The phone is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 processor with a 4G modem, and the 4,815mAh battery has 88-watt wired charging and 50W wireless charging.

The Huawei P60 Pro will be released on May 22 in the U.K., but pre-orders begin on May 9 through Huawei’s online store and some retailers. The basic 8GB/128GB version in black costs 1,200 pounds (about $1,515 U.S.), while the 12GB/512GB Rococo Pearl model is 1,399 pounds (about $1,767). A U.S. release is extremely unlikely. You can buy the Google Pixel 7 Pro today in the U.S. for $899 (or 849 British pounds in the U.K.)

Huawei P60 Pro vs. Pixel 7 Pro camera specs

The Huawei P60 Pro has three cameras on the back: its main 48-megapixel Ultra Lighting camera, a 48MP RYYB telephoto camera for a 3.5x optical zoom, and a 13MP wide-angle camera. A 10-channel spectrum sensor is also on board, along with a feature where you can manually shift between an f/1.4 and f/4.0 aperture. We also saw this on the Mate 50 Pro and something similar on the Xiaomi 13 Ultra.

Huawei has worked to improve lowlight performance, with the P60 Pro’s main camera taking in 3x more light than the P50 Pro for more detail in dark areas, fewer artifacts, and more balanced colors. There’s a three-axis anti-shake system for more stable shots, a macro mode, and a maximum of 200x zoom.

The Google Pixel 7 Pro has been around for a while now and is recognized as a brilliant camera phone. It has a 50MP main camera, a 48MP telephoto camera for a 5x optical zoom, and a 12MP wide-angle camera. It also has a spectral sensor, laser autofocus, and optical and electronic image stabilization.

We only had a few hours with the Huawei P60 Pro, so this test isn’t as comprehensive as some of our other comparisons, where we take photos over the course of multiple days and in different environments. Here, the photos were taken over one evening and some on the following morning. For example, we didn’t test out the macro or manually adjustable aperture. However, the main cameras got a serious workout, and we can still come to a satisfactory conclusion.

The P60 Pro’s main camera is a beast

The two cameras don’t take exactly the same photo, and there are distinct similarities between them, as you’ll see as we look at images taken with the main camera. Our first was taken as the sun was setting, and both handled the color of the giraffe in an almost identical and very realistic way. The Huawei P60 Pro has boosted the color of the sky, which is a little-washed out in the Pixel 7 Pro’s photo, but it does reveal a little more detail in the shadows around the scrub.

Our second shot was taken in a moving vehicle, but there’s no evidence of shake at all from either phone. The sunset is very different, though, and it’s clear where Huawei has worked on color balance specifically for this situation; the Pixel 7 Pro’s sunset is blown-out, and the P60 Pro’s shot is far more appealing. There’s also a lot of noise throughout the Pixel 7 Pro’s image. Although the sun was setting, neither phone used night mode here.

While this beautiful realism makes the P60 Pro’s camera look strong so far, it doesn’t always deal with color very well. The next photo was taken shortly after the sun had set, but again, Night mode didn’t come into action. Here, the Pixel 7 Pro has done a far better job of capturing accurate colors. It’s not just in one area, but the color of the sky, trees, the ground, and the vehicle itself.

In other challenging lighting, the P60 Pro really does excel. This photo was taken in a church in quite low light, facing a window with a bright day outside. White balance is absolutely spot-on, and there’s so much more detail and color accuracy than in the Pixel 7 Pro’s photo. The P60 Pro’s image is slightly sharper too.

I didn’t tap to focus in the last image, as I didn’t think I’d have to, but the Pixel 7 Pro has opted to focus in the center of the image, so the cake is blurry, while the Huawei P60 Pro has captured the slice of the cake perfectly in focus. The colors are excellent, there’s a lovely depth of field in both images, and the white balance is just about right too. But only the P60 Pro took the photo I’d want to share, and that’s a big advantage in situations where you may only get the chance for one shot.

The P60 Pro’s camera takes sharp, realistic, colorful, and vibrant photos, often with less noise than the Pixel 7 Pro. Google’s excellent camera is reliable and very capable, but it can’t quite match the P60 Pro in this short test.

Winner: Huawei P60 Pro

Google still has the edge for ultrawide photos

The differences between the wide-angle photos are interesting, as the Huawei P60 Pro has a tendency to lessen the amount of blue, while the Pixel 7 Pro is more accurate with its treatment of the sky. It’s noticeable throughout the wide-angle photos and may be a software tuning issue — or even something that’s caused by Huawei’s unusual RYYB sensor (where the pixels use a red, yellow, yellow, blue color spectrum instead of red, green, and blue. It’s certainly not a bad look, and the rest of the colors in the first photo are more pleasing and accurate than in the Pixel 7 Pro’s, but the sky does look a little off.

It’s visible again in the second photo, which was taken on a different day and in a different location from the first image, yet the color of the sky is different in the same way. The Pixel 7 Pro’s stronger HDR effect makes the photo pop, especially in the stonework and the wooden fence, and the photo is sharper than the P60 Pro’s too.

The final wide-angle photo shows how much wider the P60 Pro’s camera is compared to the Pixel 7 Pro, but the same differences in color and exposure persist. The Pixel 7 Pro’s photo has a harder HDR effect and deeper blues, while the P60 Pro has a smoother, colder look.

The Huawei P60 Pro has a wider-angle camera than the Pixel 7 Pro and will create a more epic image in the right environment, but the colors aren’t quite as well balanced as the Google camera’s — and they aren’t always as sharp and focused either, allowing the Pixel 7 Pro to consistently take more attractive wide-angle photos.

Winner: Google Pixel 7 Pro

A tough telephoto comparison

Rather than break this down into individual sections, we’re going to look at the overall ability of each phone when using the various zoom modes. Time with the P60 Pro for this test was limited, and we didn’t take as many photos as usual, making it fairer to assess the telephoto as a whole for now. The photos in the two galleries below were taken at different zoom levels, allowing us to understand the versatility of each phone instead of concentrating solely on photo quality in each mode.

Let’s begin with the Huawei P60 Pro. All the images were taken at 3.5x and 10x zoom, which are the default shortcuts in the camera app. Results are good, and you’ll be pleased with the 3.5x shots, which usually have a lovely tone and can add in a strong depth of field to help you be more creative. There’s plenty of detail too. The 10x shots use a digital zoom, but in good light, you’ll have to look hard to see much evidence of this. However, the focus can be a little off at 10x, and there’s a lot of noise and smoothing in low light.

For the Pixel 7 Pro, the shots were mostly manipulated to match the P60 Pro’s zoom level, making it a serious challenge for the Pixel as these are outside its optical zoom range. However, Google uses its Super Zoom software feature to enhance zoomed images, and it’s very impressive. The 3.5x and 10x shots easily compete with the P60 Pro’s in detail, although the colors are not as strong. However, in low light, the Pixel’s zoom rarely captured colors and tone more successfully than the P60 Pro.

What’s interesting is when you compare the 3.5x on the P60 Pro with the Pixel 7 Pro’s 2x. The final two photos above show a car taken at these zooms, and the Pixel 7 Pro’s photo is more natural-looking in terms of color — but it contains a lot less detail and more smoothing. It’s attractive when you glance at it, but examine it closely, and Huawei has it beaten. When I was taking photos in an ever-evolving situation, such as with the animals, the P60 Pro was more versatile and produced better photos in more lighting conditions. In this preliminary test, it wins over the Pixel 7 Pro.

Winner: Huawei P60 Pro

Both phones work well in the dark

Because I only had a short time with the Huawei P60 Pro, there was only one night to try the camera in low light, so it’s difficult to assess it fairly. That said, I can come to a preliminary decision, just like with the telephoto camera.

What have we learned? The Huawei P60 Pro takes sharper and better-focused photos in low light and dark conditions, but its colors are often unrealistic and contain a heavy blue tint. There’s also clear evidence of digital processing, which is obvious enough that it can spoil photos.

Previous Next 1 of 3 Pixel 7 Pro Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Pixel 7 Pro Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Pixel 7 Pro Andy Boxall/Digital Trends

The Pixel 7 Pro’s Night mode photos have more natural and realistic colors, and they avoid introducing edge enhancement in the way the P60 Pro does. However, the photos have a lot less detail, and they are far less sharp too. It’s difficult to choose a winner here, as both have significant positive and negative aspects. Without the benefit of further testing, it’s going to be a draw.

Winner: Draw

Huawei’s back on its game

The Huawei P60 Pro has taken two out of the four wins here, with the Pixel 7 Pro only taking the win in one section and the pair drawing in another. The P60 Pro won the crucial main camera category, showing the company may have bounced back from its lull while it dealt with Leica’s departure and the development of its own XMage camera system.

It’s also showing promise with the telephoto mode, another area Huawei has innovated in the past, but the real test will be against the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, which has an optical 10x zoom in addition to other settings. The Pixel 7 Pro held its own, though, and still took some great zoom photos. The Pixel also took better wide-angle photos, and in many ways, I personally prefer the night mode photos it takes, but dislike the noise introduced in them. It’s by no means a total Huawei win here, but the outlook is good, and it really has impressed during this short test.

Not only will the Pixel Tablet retail for more than Apple's entry-level iPad, but it will also cost more than the cheapest iPad Air configuration. The Pixel Tablet could prove more versatile thanks to its bundled docking station, though.

4 Reviews

According to new information shared by leaker @billbil_kun, Google plans to launch the Pixel Tablet for €679.99 in France with 128 GB of storage. While the leak coincides with an earlier report shared by WinFuture, it is worth noting that France's VAT percentage is lower than in many other Eurozone members. Specifically, France will apply 20% VAT on the Pixel Tablet, 1% below the European Union average. Hence, the Pixel Tablet may start at slightly less in Germany where VAT is 19%. Conversely, the Pixel Tablet may cost a fair bit more in Denmark, Ireland, Portugal and Sweden, among others.

The same leaker adds that Google will charge €799.99 for 256 GB configurations, again in France. Surprisingly, Google will charge disproportionately more for a memory upgrade with the Pixel Tablet than the Pixel 7. Based on the information provided by @billbil_kun, there will be a €120 difference between the Pixel Tablet's two memory configurations, €20 more than the Pixel 7. It is also worth noting that the Pixel Tablet will be more expensive than the iPad 10 with 256 GB of storage. The latest iPad Air will be €10 cheaper than the Pixel Tablet too, but only with 64 GB of storage.",technology,1

Microsoft is bringing Microsoft 365 Copilot to more customers and releasing new research that shows how AI will change the way we work

REDMOND, Wash. — May 9, 2023 — Earlier this year, Microsoft Corp. introduced Microsoft 365 Copilot, which will bring powerful new generative AI capabilities to apps millions of people use every day like Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Microsoft Teams and more.

On Tuesday, the company announced it is expanding access to the Microsoft 365 Copilot preview and introducing new features. The company also released new data and insights from its 2023 Work Trend Index report: “Will AI Fix Work?”

The data shows that the pace of work has accelerated faster than humans can keep up, and it’s impacting innovation. Next-generation AI will lift the weight of work. Organizations that move first to embrace AI will break the cycle — increasing creativity and productivity for everyone.

“This new generation of AI will remove the drudgery of work and unleash creativity,” said Satya Nadella, chairman and CEO, Microsoft. “There’s an enormous opportunity for AI-powered tools to help alleviate digital debt, build AI aptitude and empower employees.”

The report shares three key insights for business leaders as they look to understand and responsibly adopt AI for their organization:

Digital debt is costing us innovation: We’re all carrying digital debt: The volume of data, emails and chats has outpaced our ability to process it all. There is an opportunity to make our existing communications more productive. Every minute spent managing this digital debt is a minute not spent on creative work. Sixty-four percent of employees don’t have enough time and energy to get their work done and those employees are 3.5x more likely to say they struggle with being innovative or thinking strategically. Of time spent in Microsoft 365, the average person spends 57% communicating and only 43% creating. There’s a new AI-employee alliance: For employees, the promise of relief outweighs job loss fears and managers are looking to empower employees with AI, not replace. Forty-nine percent of people say they’re worried AI will replace their jobs, but even more — 70% — would delegate as much work as possible to AI in order to lessen their workloads. In fact, leaders are 2x more likely to say that AI would be most valuable in their workplace by boosting productivity rather than cutting headcount. Every employee needs AI aptitude: Every employee, not just AI experts, will need new core competencies such as prompt engineering in their day to day. Eighty-two percent of leaders anticipate employees will need new skills in the AI era, and as of March 2023, jobs on LinkedIn in the U.S. mentioning GPT have increased by 79% year over year. This new, in-demand and AI-centric skillset will have ripple effects across everything from resumes to job postings.

“The pace and volume of work have increased exponentially and are outpacing humans’ ability to keep up,” said Jared Spataro, CVP, Modern Work and Business Applications. “In a world where creativity is the new productivity, digital debt is more than an inconvenience — it’s a threat to innovation. Next-generation AI will lift the weight of work and free us all to focus on the work that matters.”

To empower businesses in the AI era, Microsoft is introducing the Microsoft 365 Copilot Early Access Program with an initial wave of 600 enterprise customers worldwide in an invitation-only paid preview program. In addition, the following new capabilities will be added to Microsoft 365 Copilot and Microsoft Viva:
